          <p eId="para_1">This morning, the board of Tallaght hospital is meeting to consider the impact of a 300 page report by the Health Information and Quality Authority on safety at the hospital's emergency department.  I understand a press conference will be held at 12 noon, before the report is laid before the House.  Comments by the Dublin County Coroner last year, following his examination of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Thomas Walsh, appalled everyone.  Mr. Walsh was a 65 year old man who died after being placed in a hospital corridor as a result of overcrowding.  Shockingly, the coroner asked whether it would be safer for patients to stay at home rather than attend the accident and emergency unit in Tallaght hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Since the death of Mr. Walsh, the practice of keeping patients on trolleys in corridors was to cease, particularly in Tallaght hospital.  Will the Tánaiste confirm that this has been the case and no patients have been kept on trolleys in the hospital?  Will he outline if the recruitment moratorium is having a greater impact on Tallaght hospital than other hospitals?</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Reports in the media this morning indicate the HIQA report will have consequences for all accident and emergency wards.  Will the Tánaiste assure the House that investment will be made to implement the recommendations of the report and ensure the safety of patients in accident and emergency units in Tallaght hospital and elsewhere?  If a ban is imposed on keeping patients on trolleys, accident and emergency departments will automatically require more staff to ensure patients receive the type of care they need when they attend hospital.  Last Thursday, the Tánaiste took great pride in outlining to the House the reduction achieved in the number of trolleys in accident and emergency departments this year.  So far this year, 26,000 patients have been treated on trolleys in our accident and emergency wards.  In Beaumont Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, the figure has increased.  Is it intended that HIQA will visit Beaumont Hospital?  Will the Tánaiste assure the House and members of the public that the Government has a plan to ensure our accident and emergency wards are made safer for patients and that they will no longer have to wait on trolleys when they attend hospital to receive care in a time of need?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_4">Today, the Health Information and Quality Authority published its report of the investigation into the quality, safety and governance of the care provided by Tallaght hospital for patients who require acute admissions.  The investigation followed the death of a patient, Mr. Thomas Walsh from Kilnamanagh in Tallaght, who died at the hospital in March 2011 while in a corridor awaiting a bed.  I offer my deepest sympathy to the families involved.  I know the loved ones in this case will find the publication of the report traumatic.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Patients in all of our acute hospitals need the assurance that this matter is being addressed in an effective manner, lessons have been learned and quality assurance systems are being implemented across the hospital system.  At the heart of the HIQA investigation are very serious matters about patient safety, how hospital services should be managed and provided and the manner in which we ensure our acute hospital system, including Tallaght Hospital, is safely and properly managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Many changes have already taken place in Tallaght hospital.  The practice of leaving patients waiting for admission on trolleys in a corridor adjacent to the emergency department was clinically unsafe and completely unacceptable and has been stopped.  The Health Information and Quality Authority wrote to the Minister for Health last November arising from its concerns about the deficits in governance and management at the hospital.  As a result, a new interim board chaired by Sir Keith Pearson was appointed last December and a new chief executive officer is in place who is building a new management team, including clinical leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The Minister will study the report with great interest and is determined its recommendations will be implemented as a matter of urgency.  As I stated, many changes are already under way in Tallaght hospital and I understand this is acknowledged in the HIQA report.  The staff of the hospital have an important role to play in responding to the challenges ahead and restoring and nurturing the hospital to achieve its potential.  I ask the local community to support them and the hospital as they face the challenges ahead.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_8">It is not a wonder that our accident and emergency wards are under pressure when up to 66,000 people left the private insurance system last year and up to 2,000 hospital beds remain closed.  The HIQA report published today appears to have implications for every other accident and emergency unit.  I seek an assurance from the Tánaiste that the resources and staff required to meet the needs of those who visit our accident and emergency departments in their time of greatest need will be provided.  For a coroner to ask if it would be safer for people to stay at home than to visit an emergency department and to wonder aloud if accident and emergency units are dangerous places is not acceptable.  We need a commitment from the Tánaiste that accident and emergency departments will be effectively staffed and beds will be made available in order that people are no longer required to wait on trolleys.  It is unacceptable that such a scenario awaits people attending our hospitals.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_11">Since this occurred last year, there have been big changes in Tallaght Hospital.  The board has been replaced, there is a new chairperson and CEO and there is a new regime in the hospital.  Very big changes have been made in Tallaght Hospital itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Second, with regard to the wider issue of trolleys, when people present to a hospital and need to get treatment, they should be able to get a bed.  That is the objective.  We have had a pattern of people being kept on trolleys for far longer than they should be.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_14">The Government and the Minister for Health, through the special delivery unit, SDU, has been driving down the number of people on trolleys.  There has been a reduction of 17% in the number of people on trolleys throughout the country.  In the greater Dublin area the reduction is 23%.  A system is in place whereby the number of people on trolleys is assessed every day.</p>

Life in the real economy, for the 440,000 people on the live register, the 1,500 people who emigrate every week and the 91 people who fall into mortgage distress every day, has got harder.  Five austerity budgets have seen the living standards of the majority of people drop dramatically, and the Government is set to continue on this path.  The austerity treaty will make life harder for these people as a result of harsher levels of austerity after 2015.</p>

Everyone who has lost a job, whose business has gone bad or is having difficulty paying a mortgage or making ends meet knows that.  There is only one thing we have to do, and that is to work our way out of the situation.  To do that we must, first, get our economy to grow again, and it is growing.  There was growth in 2011 and there is projected growth for this year and next year, for the first time in four years.  We have to get people to invest in the economy and we are succeeding in doing that.  Since the beginning of this year we have seen jobs announcements.  About 1,000 jobs per month were announced by investors who have decided this is a good place to invest.  We are seeing it again today.  Yesterday, Rehab announced a significant number of jobs.  There will be more jobs announcements in Galway today.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We must ensure investors and people who are thinking of investing in the country maintain confidence in the country.  To do that, they must be sure we have a stable currency and our relationship to the euro is safe.  That is why the Government is asking people to vote "Yes" to the stability treaty on 31 May.</p>

We will have an opportunity to make a strong statement that, as a country, we are certain about the euro; that we want to have stability; that we want investors to have confidence in the country; that there is no question about the country's relationship with the euro, and that we want to have access to emergency funding should we ever need it.  There will be certainty when the people make a decision on 31 May.  I do not intend, therefore, to accept Deputy shane Ross's Bill.

What the country needs, at a time of uncertainty in Europe, particularly in Greece, is for individual citizens to make a clear statement that we want stability and certainty.  Every individual citizen will have the opportunity on 31 May to make a very clear statement in the privacy of the ballot box that we want a stable Europe.  It will be an opportunity to state our desire for certainty about our own future in terms of emergency funding and certainty and stability in order that investors will have the confidence to continue investing in Ireland and thus create jobs and allow the economy to recover.  I do not hold the idea that we should stand back and wait to see what way the wind is blowing.  What does Deputy Ross expect investors would do in such a scenario?  I was at a meeting yesterday morning organised by American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and attended by 100 senior executives of American companies investing in the State.  What kind of report would they send to headquarters were I to tell them that we were postponing the referendum to wait to see how the wind was blowing?  If we take that approach, investors will do exactly the same.  We must have certainty and stability in order that there will be investment in this country.  What has happened in France is something the Government welcomes because it contributes to the growth agenda and promoting job creation in Europe.  That is very much in harmony with what we are doing in order to promote growth and provide a stimulus in the domestic economy, with a view to getting more people into work, allowing the economy to recover and making this a better country.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this debate on the 44th plenary meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, which was held in the Seanad Chamber earlier this week.  I understand this is the first occasion on which Dáil time has been specifically set aside to discuss the outcome of a plenary meeting of the assembly.  It is only right that this should be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The assembly has a long and distinguished history since its establishment in 1990 as the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.  It has brought together parliamentarians from the Oireachtas and Westminster and, since its expansion in 2001, the Northern Ireland, Welsh and Scottish Assemblies and the Parliaments of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.  It provides a forum for representatives of the people of these islands to discuss matters of mutual concern and work together in finding imaginative and co-operative solutions to the challenges we all face.  It has also been a significant tool in deepening mutual understanding and building friendships between parliamentarians from the various jurisdictions.  These relationships, built on foundations of trust, respect and admiration which are established in the shared experience of participation at assembly meetings, have proved invaluable in fostering reconciliation and the resolution of conflict on this island.  In that respect, I note the important contribution made by the BIPA to the successes of the peace process in recent decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Perhaps the most important role played by the assembly has been to allow members the opportunity to consider the dynamics of the British-Irish relationship and examine ways of deepening that relationship.  As such, this last meeting could not have come at a more opportune time.  It was exactly one year ago today that Queen Elizabeth arrived at Casement Aerodrome at the start of her historic state visit to Ireland.  I recall greeting her as she stepped onto Irish soil and the sense of historic occasion that accompanied the various elements of her visit with which we are so familiar.  In recent months the British and Irish Governments have worked hard to build on the success of that visit.  The relationship between our islands has reached a new maturity and an unprecedented level of respect and co-operation.  The joint <i>communiqué</i> on the future of British-Irish relations issued by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron following their summit meeting in March was ground-breaking.  It was a forward-looking statement identifying key areas for co-operation between our countries in the decade ahead.  It was, notably, the first such statement that was not in large part concerned with the situation in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">That is not to say Northern Ireland has diminished in importance.  On the contrary, the joint statement reiterates the commitment of the two Governments to the full implementation of the agreements and supporting the Executive in the ongoing process of reconciliation, with the goal of creating a cohesive, shared and integrated society in Northern Ireland.  However, it is because such startling successes have been achieved in the peace process so far that our relationship with Britain no longer needs to be defined primarily with Northern Ireland.  The visit of Queen Elizabeth last year symbolised the normalisation of relations between these islands.  The challenge before us is to identify new bases on which to develop the British-Irish partnership and the joint statement sets out the way forward in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Next year Britain and Ireland will celebrate 40 years of working together as partners in Europe.  Last week marked the 40th anniversary of the referendum on Irish accession to the then EEC.  The opportunity to work together as equals in such a key multilateral organisation played a large part in our ability to come together as equals bilaterally.  The joint statement prioritises the need for us to work together to support the development of an outward facing European Union which promotes job creation and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">More often than not in international fora, we find ourselves on the same side of the argument as the British Government when addressing global challenges.  I was personally struck by the importance of such a close working relationship when I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, which prevented my joining the meeting in Leinster House.  It was through co-operation with Britain, and other partners, in that forum that we were able to reach agreement on what I consider was an important statement on the Middle East peace process, as well as other issues.  The joint statement identifies the need for continued close co-operation between Britain and Ireland within the European Union and other multilateral organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The most pressing task facing all of us, east and west, in addition to North and South, is dealing with the economic crisis.  As legislators during these difficult times, our primary focus must be on the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic growth to secure the prosperity and well-being of the citizens of these islands.  It is inconceivable that we would even begin to address this challenge without looking, in the first instance, to our economic relationship with Britain, our largest and most significant trading partner.  The mutual dependence of our economies is widely recognised on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Prime Minister Cameron has noted that British exports to Ireland outstrip those to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRIC, combined.  By the same token, Irish exports to the United Kingdom in 2011 increased by €600 million, far greater than the rate of export growth to the BRIC countries in the same period.  Irish goods and services are well established on the British market, but significant potential for future growth remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">It is unsurprising, therefore, that in identifying areas for co-operation the joint statement devotes a substantial section to the economic relationship.  It commits the two Governments to intensifying co-operation on research and development in order to support innovation.  It identifies, in particular, the energy sector as a key area of economic potential, given the imminent commissioning of the east-west interconnector.  We will seek to promote further investment in the area of renewable energy.  The statement also highlights the potential for greater co-operation and collaboration in the lucrative agrifood sector and in other areas such as professional and financial services, ICT and the creative industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">To better guide our approach to strengthened economic co-operation, the two Governments have agreed to prepare a joint evaluation of the economic relationship between the islands.  I am very heartened to see that the areas the Government identifies as priorities for British-Irish co-operation are very much mirrored in the agenda for the plenary meeting.  We are at one in recognising the central importance of further developing economic co-operation between Britain and Ireland for our mutual benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I recognise that members discussed a variety of important issues in the course of the meeting, including the role of transport in supporting business and tourism, opportunities for the food sector in Britain and Ireland and the potential for shared services in the health sector.  I also note that leading figures of the business community were invited to address the plenary meeting.  This a very welcome initiative, allowing parliamentarians to hear directly from business their views on what the Governments should be doing to make business easier.  It also allows members to raise issues of concern to themselves or their constituents directly with business leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I commend, in particular, Deputy Joe McHugh and his co-chairman, Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, for their tremendous achievement in delivering such a substantial programme of work and ably managing the meeting over the course of the two days.  As an indication of the priority attached by the Government to the work of the assembly, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, both former members of the assembly, in addition to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, took the time to address the meeting and engage in productive discussions with members.  The members were also received at Áras an Uachtaráin by President Higgins, a very active former member of the assembly.  I am pleased to note the British Government was represented by the Secretary of State, Mr. Owen Paterson.  This level of participation and engagement gave a particular focus and substance to the discussions over the course of the two days and contributed to what was one of the most productive assembly meetings of recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I thank all Members who participated, from the Oireachtas, Westminster and other Assemblies, for their efforts.  Discussion at the BIPA of issues of mutual concern to all of us across these islands is vital, but it is only the start of the work.  It is up to all members to build on the success of this meeting, bring the work of the assembly to the wider Oireachtas membership and allow the ideas and suggestions raised at the meeting to feed into consideration of policy at all levels.  As the Taoiseach said in his address on Monday, Britain remains our nearest neighbour and closest friend.  As the Government considers how best to deepen the relationship with Britain in the coming months, the outcome of the BIPA debates will continue to play a central role.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_280">I welcome the debate on this issue.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and indeed, Deputy McHugh, who I am sure was instrumental in us having the debate on the plenary session.  It is, I understand, the first time that such a debate has taken place and it is important we recognise the valuable work this session has done and that the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has done over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">As a former Member of Seanad Éireann, and having been briefly a member of the then British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly and the honour of being its Vice Chairman, it was a pleasure to see the assembly meet in the Upper House.  It is good to reflect on such an auspicious occasion.  The plenary session marked the first time the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly met in the Seanad.  It is good to see it becoming a small part of the history of the Upper House, a House that has produced so many political luminaries - our first President, Dubhghlas de hÍde, our first female President, Mary Robinson, and the late Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">This morning, while thinking about the significance of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, another well known former Senator came to mind, William Butler Yeats.  He was better known as a poet, but he served in the Senate of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1928.  It was Yeats who wrote the immortal lines:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_283">Out of Ireland have we come,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_284">Great hatred, little room,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_285">Maimed us at the start.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_286">I carry from my mother's womb</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_287">A fanatic heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Those words are appropriate to reflect on today.  Thankfully, in our time, the great hatreds on this island and between these islands are mellowing and have, in fact, given way to a new and unprecedented era of co-operation between the Irish and British peoples.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Part of the reason for this magnificent and long overdue transformation has been the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  In 1990, this body met for the first time under the co-chairmanship of Peter Temple-Morris MP and my late party colleague, the inimitable Jim Tunney.  The then British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body held its inaugural meeting in a very different political climate.  It was a time when fear and murder still stalked the streets of Northern Ireland and a time when great hatreds and mutual suspicion all too often characterised Anglo-Irish relations.  So much has changed in a generation and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has played a significant part in building co-operation out of conflict and friendship among former foes.  The perseverance and success of parliamentarians from each of the democratic assemblies on these islands has proven to be so fruitful.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">This great and enduring work has underpinned peace when for generations people said it could not be done and that we would always have conflict between Ireland and Britain.  In more modern times, this same spirit of co-operation will help our respective nations to get through and beyond the effects of the worst global recession since the era of the Wall Street Crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I commend the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, especially its respective co-chairs, Deputy Joe McHugh and Rt. Hon. Laurence Robertson MP, for the valuable work been done in the plenary session and for their foresight in focusing on economic and trade matters which are so essential to our shared futures.  I sincerely believe the solution to the economic crisis we are experiencing will be achieved through the wise use of trade and investment.  The United Kingdom and Ireland have a mutually beneficial relationship in this regard.  So much of the plenary session was about building on the solid foundations already there, and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I do not want to get caught up on a ream of meaningless figures and I will confine myself to citing two significant statistics which illustrate how our respective economies are helping each other in these difficult times.  The UK accounts for 42% of total Irish exports, and Ireland is the fifth largest market for British businesses.  What those two vital statistics say to me is that it is absolutely essential that we continue to develop our trading relationships, particularly in the context of the economic downturn.  Working together we are stronger and as good neighbours we should not be afraid to pull together on matters of mutual economic benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">This fiscal crisis has been a crisis of globalisation.  It has no respect for national borders and many nations, not only Ireland or Britain, are facing unprecedented economic pressures.  A crisis of this size requires co-operation and shared approaches to restoring growth.  In that regard, my party fully endorses the innovative and worthwhile proposal made at the plenary session by Mr. Sean O'Driscoll, CEO and chairman of Glen Dimplex, for an annual British Irish trade mission.  I was pleased to learn that the annual trade mission proposal has received the backing of the assembly members and that Deputy McHugh and Rt. Hon. Laurence Robertson MP will now put this proposal before the respective Governments.  Nothing but good can come from having an annual British-Irish trade mission, led by either the Taoiseach or the Prime Minister or Cabinet Members, and including business leaders, to explore trade opportunities between our two nations.  In today's competitive global marketplace we must give ourselves every advantage and that is the value of this gathering.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">For over two decades, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly has been involved in pushing practical, wise and, at times, ingenious ideas to benefit the people who we all represent.  Parliamentary work is often described by those outside as turgid, but in the past this assembly has shown it can make a hugely positive difference to the lives of people in Britain and Ireland and never was this more true than in its work to stop the senseless violence in Northern Ireland.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly provided so much of the building blocks that became the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement from which lasting peace has flowed.  It is not an understatement to say the work of this body has also been a triumph for constitutionalism and parliamentary democracy.  Since its inception, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has brought together democratically elected politicians from across Ireland and the United Kingdom with a view to finding real and just solutions to the shared problems we faced through constructive dialogue and mutual respect, and never through the threat of force.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The success of those efforts was reflected in the capital city of this sovereign Republic exactly one year ago today.  On that occasion, Queen Elizabeth II, as the British Head of State, laid a wreath in the Garden of Remembrance, which honours those who fought for Irish freedom down through the ages.  This act was symbolic of the new maturity in British-Irish relations.  The warmth with which this action was received also vindicated the vision and political courage of former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, who had extended the invitation to the Queen through Prime Minister Cameron in June 2010 and who had stated such a visit was now desirable as "part of the normal courtesies enjoyed by friendly, neighbouring states."</p>
          <p eId="para_296">This visit has shown the British and Irish people that we should not ignore our history and our long interaction with each other.  More importantly, whether we are proud to be Irish or English, Scottish or Welsh, British or from the Isle of Man, Jersey or Guernsey, we all can work constructively together for the common good of our respective nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I started by quoting Yeats and I want to conclude by quoting another individual prominent in the psyche of Irish history, the late US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  In a famous speech at the American University in summer 1963, Kennedy appealed for an end to the Cold War.  Now that the cold war between Britain and Ireland has finally been replaced by a new era of warmth and respect, there is something very apt about Kennedy's words:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_298">let us ... direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved... For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet.  We all breathe the same air.  We all cherish our children's future.  And we are all mortal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_299">In 1990, the year of the setting-up of the then British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, we lived in a different place in so far as circumstances prevailing at that time meant there was conflict, there were people being killed, there were bombings, there was state violence, and there were arrests, detentions and imprisonments.  There was, around that time and maybe a few years earlier, the beginning of a serious effort to bring about dialogue and negotiations.  There were the courageous efforts of the Hume-Adams initiative.  There were also those who still remain nameless but who worked behind the scenes to help bring about a situation whereby it was possible to resolve the reasons for conflict in a humane way and through dialogue and negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">During the period to which I refer, the British and Irish Governments recognised a security agenda would not deliver a lasting peace.  The IRA ceasefire was still four years away and it would be eight years until the Good Friday Agreement emerged.  I was a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison at that time.  I was incarcerated with hundreds of republican and other prisoners.  We always had hope and a sense that people would come to the understanding that we had to find different ways of dealing with the outstanding issues that existed and of pursuing our objectives.  The IRA ceasefire came into effect on 1 September 1994.  This gave John Major the opportunity to approach the matter in a positive way but, unfortunately, he was the leader of a weakened Government which was dependent upon the Unionists.  The ceasefire collapsed but thankfully there was a change of Government in England in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power.  There was also a change of Government in the Twenty-six Counties.  In addition, the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, became involved.  The coming together of all these progressive forces effectively led to the implementation of a second IRA ceasefire and to the commencement of negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I am not interested in scoring points and I am of the view it is good that matters are where they currently stand.  It must be noted, however, there were doubters, especially in the political arena, who believed what eventually came to pass could never have happened.  It did happen because progressive people, elements and leaders in the various parties and within the two Governments were prepared to look ahead and to try to build a future for our children.  Their aim was to leave a positive legacy for the generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">We moved on, negotiations took place and the Good Friday Agreement came into being.  Again, the latter involved a historic compromise and people of political influence were able to deliver their respective constituencies.  The outcome of the process relating to the Good Friday Agreement has led us to where we now find ourselves.  Subsequently, the St. Andrews and Hillsborough Agreements were brought forward and we are now living in a far better place.  I must acknowledge the role played by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly during the long period to which I refer.  When one is living through events, it often seems they take a long time to transpire.  When one looks at them through the prism of history, however, and in the context of conflict resolution and so forth, one can see the period involved is very short.  That is particularly true when one is aware of the place from which one came.  All of us in this House have lived through such a period.  The Tánaiste and I might have more of an understanding of other types of struggle in the context of our respective parties and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">There are some outstanding and, indeed, very painful issues which remain to be considered and resolved.  I refer, in particular, to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Today is the 38th anniversary of the bombing of certain parts of this city.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Some 34 people were killed on 17 May 1974 and, as yet, they have not received justice.  Neither have their families received the support of or a commitment from the Garda or the British authorities in the context of a resolution of the outstanding problems.  Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement have met the victims' families on a number of occasions.  We met the families of the Monaghan victims in the very recent past.  Even the funding provided to assist these people in their efforts has been cut.  The Taoiseach has given a commitment - I hope he lives up to it - to restore the funding in question.  All that is involved is a small sum of money to assist people in trying to seek justice for their lost loved ones.  There is no doubt they deserve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">There is also an outstanding issue in respect of the Ballymurphy massacre.  The legacy of the latter is extremely painful for the families of those who were cut down in their own community by British forces.  The McEntee report indicates those who carried out inquiries into these matters were significantly restricted in their investigations by the refusal of the British authorities to co-operate.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly needs to exert pressure on the Irish and British Governments and the security services in order that a just resolution in respect of the painful matters to which I refer and the legacy with which the victims' relatives have been obliged to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">My party and I are strongly of the view that what is needed to resolve these issues is a commitment to establish an international truth commission.  Such an entity would allow us to begin a process of national and international reconciliation.  If a truth commission were put in place, it would allow us to clean the slate.  The families of the victims, who are themselves also victims, would have the opportunity to witness reconciliation for everyone involved in their lifetimes.  This has already been done to a large extent in South Africa, which experienced a very painful period of political, state-sponsored and reactionary violence.  All that is required to establish an international truth commission is the requisite political will.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I am an Irish republican and I want to see an end to the Union.  I am sure everyone in the House shares the same aspiration.  I want to bring about a united Ireland in which people can determine the future together.  The Union is becoming less relevant and significant, both in this country and in Britain, where the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly are now in existence.  The Tánaiste referred to the economic benefits relating to the peace process and so forth.  The economic benefits to the island of Ireland of ending the Union are extremely transparent.  There are many duplicate structures on this island, including those relating to agriculture, tourism and policing.  We could be working together to bring about a situation whereby it would be far more economically beneficial for the island of Ireland to have a single structure in place.  That is all possible.  Provision is made in the Good Friday Agreement to move towards bringing about an end to British control in the Six Counties with the consent of the people who live there.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">As already stated, when one is living through events they seem to take a very long time to transpire.  When we look back, however, we can see that this has been quite a short period in our history.  We have managed to bring 99.9% of the people to a place where it will be possible to resolve our outstanding difficulties in a peaceful manner.  I have been associated with the struggle in the past and there are those on the other side of the House who were associated with it in the early 1970s.  I refer to certain members of the Government who were involved in the same form of struggle with which I was associated.</p>

I refer, in particular, to very courageous people such as Deputy Adams and John Hume, who were responsible for kick-starting the whole thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this debate on the 44th plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  I thank and commend all my colleagues for their work on this body.  However, it is up to all Members, both Deputies and Senators, to play our part in building and developing relationships on the island and between the islands.  We should never take the peace process for granted and we all have a part to play in furthering conflict resolution, which is why I am supportive of the BIPA.  I thank and commend Deputy McHugh, chairman of the BIPA, and his co-chair, Laurence Robertson MP, for their work on this noble project.  Regardless of political differences in this House, they are doing an excellent job and have the support of all parties and Independents.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">When the assembly comes to Dublin, it gets a massive reception with the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers turning up.  The same happens in the North and it is warmly received when it attends Scotland.  However, I have heard from BIPA members that they are not happy with some sections of the British establishment when the plenary is held in London.  The British Government and those involved would want to take this parliamentary body seriously.  It makes a massive contribution to peace and justice throughout the islands which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Deputy Ferris mentioned that today is the 38th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I offer my support and sympathy to the families who I believe are marking it on Talbot Street.  Many Members were invited but could not make it because we are speaking in this debate.  It is important we remember the victims.  When their support group looks for funding, they should be supported by the Government.  I was saddened to learn in the past 24 hours that the office for Justice for the Forgotten is now located in a portakabin in a back garden in north county Dublin because it could not get funding, some €14,000, for office facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">It is important we zoom in regularly and remind ourselves of the rights of citizens in the North and the South and the basic principles in the Good Friday Agreement.  One of these basic principles is accommodating diversity and enjoying difference, in which the BIPA has been directly involved.  However, we need to get that down to ground level and be more supportive of people at community level involved in projects accommodating diversity.  I have met many of them over the past six months who have briefed us on the situation.  They are concerned about sections of the peace process and conflict resolution that are not going well and about sectarian divisions on the ground.  Sectarianism, like racism, can never be tolerated.  As we all come from different religions and cultures, we can enjoy their diversity.  I welcome Deputy Martin Ferris's call for a truth commission.  We must think of the victims of 30 years of violence and their families who deserve the truth and explanations.  I urge the BIPA to take up this call.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">We must also look at the radical changes in population structures in the past three years in the North.  We soon could have a Catholic Nationalist majority there.  I know the numbers game is complex and that detailed and complex constitutional issues could arise.  I was saddened during the presidential campaign when some regularly spoke of some candidates from the North as those people up there.  We all live on the island and we should work closely together.  I want to see a calm debate and not an emotional rant.  In last year's Assembly elections, 48% voted Unionist while 42% voted Nationalist and 7.7% non-Unionist or non-Nationalist.  However, when one examines third level college participation, another picture emerges.  There are 20,995 students from Catholic backgrounds, which is 59.3%, while 14,410 are from Protestant backgrounds, which is 40%.  Many from the Protestant religion attend third level in the UK and then take up job offers there after graduation.  We need to examine population trends in the North in a calm and measured way.  Are we in the South mentally prepared for that?  Will those who claim they are democrats respect the result of a ballot on the future of the North?  The <i>status quo</i> there is up for grabs.  We have to be radical, free-thinking and out there.  There are several options such as unity, joint sovereignty, some form of federalism or even an independent North.  All these must be discussed in a non-threatening way over the next several years in order that we are prepared for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">One element of the BIPA's work I fully support is the all-Ireland economy and I commend Padraic White for his work on this.  I have heard positive reports from the North-South Ministerial Councils where Ministers were swapping telephone numbers while Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness have been trying to facilitate informal contacts.  We need to examine this as a serious option.  It can also help the Government in its calls for economic growth and job creation.  This is a small island and we could do much if we agree on an all-Ireland economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">My local football club, Shelbourne, has strong links with Linfield football club which has strong Unionist ties.  I have met some of the club's members when they have been down in Tolka Park at some great social nights.  Many people are breaking down barriers on the ground.  I commend the Shelbourne supporters for their work in ending sectarianism.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The BIPA has made a massive contribution to the peace process.  There is, however, significant potential to build on the successes of the peace process of the past decade.  There are also ways of deepening the relationships between these islands.  People have different views.  I come from the democratic republican view and do not agree in monarchies, believing people should be elected on merit.  I do not expect everyone to fully agree with this but, equally, I expect other people to accommodate my point of view as well.  I wish the BIPA well.  It contains different points of views and solutions.  I hope it will encourage conflict resolution more, deal with sectarianism and population trends in the North, as well as continuing its good work in building an all-Ireland economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I want to put on record, on behalf of my co-chairperson, Laurence Robertson MP, and BIPA members, our thanks to the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach, the Captain and the ushers for the fantastic welcome that was given this week to the 44th plenary session.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I thank the Tánaiste for the opportunity to debate the plenary session in the Chamber, and as co-chair a key aim of mine is to make the work of the assembly transparent and focused on practical outcomes.  That is the reason I introduced a number of innovations for this year's plenary session, including having the debate televised live, seeking a debate in the Dáil on its outcome and selecting a theme inviting practical outcomes, which makes business easier between Britain and Ireland.  The assembly plays a valuable role and I wanted to bring it to the attention of the public and hold ourselves to account.  We should follow up on some key ideas from the plenary session.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Taoiseach, in addressing the plenary session, called on us to be ambitious about the role the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly can play, and I, along with other members, take up that challenge.  Before mentioning a few of the outcomes, I will make reference to the original objective of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, as it was in 1990, which was to get people talking, build trust and create an environment where people could build relationships and work on many positive ideas in the peace process.  With that in mind, I acknowledge the role of many former members who worked proactively and engaged in the peace process.  I also acknowledge the officials, on both the British and Irish end, who have worked towards a well-crafted and well-written Good Friday Belfast Agreement.  We should note the work done by officials.  We are sometimes good at lauding our colleagues, peers and former political representatives but it is also important to acknowledge the role of officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In that regard I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Andrew Staunton, who represents the British Embassy today, and Ambassador Chilcott, who attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly for the first time.  I acknowledge the presence of our deputy ambassador to London, Ms Barbara Jones, who was present during the plenary session.  It was also significant to see the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Owen Paterson, MP, who represented the British Government at a Cabinet level at the assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The annual British-Irish trade mission proposal by Mr. Seán O'Driscoll, CEO of Glen Dimplex, was worthy and went down very well with assembly members.  It is an idea I will pursue with my members and the steering committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in future.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, who is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He is sitting next to me.  We offer our facilities in working towards the idea of a possible British-Irish trade mission.  As Irish people we sometimes forget what is on our doorstep and believe faraway fields are constantly greener.  These may be trade missions to Beijing or deepening relationships with Boston or Berlin.  We should not forget the close and intrinsic link with the British community.  As the Taoiseach stated, it is our closest economic ally and friend.  That issue is worth pursuing and as was suggested at the plenary session, perhaps something could be done in conjunction with the Gathering in 2013.  We are looking at a date in March 2013 for a meeting of the assembly, and we hope that will take in the idea of developing stronger relationships within the business community.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I acknowledge the contributions by many members on health synergies across Britain and Ireland.  There is the success of the partnership approach between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to develop radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital, and we should expand that to other potential areas of cross-Border and east-west co-operation.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan referred to the process where Irish boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy go to Newcastle to avail of services to treat the disease.  The Minister for Health was present on Monday, and he indicated it is not feasible to expect all rare diseases to be managed on a stand-alone basis by individual jurisdictions.  There are significant advantages from a quality and economies of scale perspective to widening these matters beyond borders.  Although we are focused primarily on the site of the new children's hospital in Ireland, we should also examine how to work together on sharing services.  There will be co-operation behind the scenes but if we are to have a state of the art children's hospital providing a range of services, we should consider shared services and synergies on an east-west basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport spoke about transport challenges in aviation, ferries and cabotage as it relates to the haulage industry.  It was interesting in that respect to see 100% participation of Welsh Assembly members on that issue, which is indicative of the unique links in this regard between Wales and Ireland.  We can co-operate on those matters in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Ms Darina Allen gave valuable insight into the future of food tourism with potential synergies in that area.  It was a valid contribution that took in regulation and how nonsensical regulation can impinge on people developing their own businesses.  We must be conscious of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">As well as pursuing the outcomes I have set out, I will also follow through on the new areas of shared interest which emerged during the debate and which will inform the agenda of future meetings.  Peripheral to the meeting was energy security, and I will bring the matter to the steering committee in July.  We may shape the next Irish plenary session around the area of energy security.  This does not just deal with transmission of energy - at that stage we will have the interconnector between the UK and Ireland that EirGrid will operate - but rather how to get communities involved and overcome obstacles to grid access.  There is also the difficult local planning issues that come with wind turbines.  I will propose that we consider offshore energy, including ocean and tidal technology, at the next session.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">There were other issues raised, such as the lack of price honesty from airlines, the importance of the decade of centenaries, the strengthening of the common travel area and the creation of a mini-Schengen area between Britain and Ireland.  President Higgins stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_330">The debates, discussions and reports are important in themselves but their true value lies outside the plenary session.  What you learn and share over the course of the sessions must be used to inform and enhance the debates in your own legislative assemblies but also, more importantly, in your own communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Our assembly has risen to the challenge and we do not want to work as an independent unit.  We want to work with other assemblies and Ministers with portfolios.  I thank the Tánaiste and the Government as a whole for facilitating this morning's session.  We are looking for continuity and we will work in a proactive way.  I look forward to updating the Parliament about this work regularly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_332">This is a brief opportunity for us to make some comments and observations about the recently held British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which took place in the Leinster House for the first time.  Before elaborating on the session, I take this opportunity to congratulate the co-chairs, Deputy McHugh and Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, on their handling and general organisation of the plenary session in the House.  These things are not possible without the organisational skills and know-how of the backroom staff in the secretariat, both here and in Britain, and, of course, the ushers and the Captain of the Guard and all those who paved the way for a difficulty-free event in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has a mission to promote co-operation between political representatives in Britain and Ireland.  It was first established as the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in 1990.  In 2001 its membership was enlarged to include Members of the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the High Court of Tynwald and the States of Guernsey and Jersey.  All these bodies are enthusiastic participants in the work of the assembly which deals with non-legislative parliamentary activities and meets on a biannual basis, with meetings of various committees being held in between.  There are four committees dealing with sovereign matters, European affairs, economic matters and environmental and social issues.  There is potential within their deliberations to consider a range of issues affecting the populace of the island as a whole and in Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There are still several aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement that remain to be completed.  It is important that progress be made on the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, while progress on the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum has also been slow.  There is a working group in the Oireachtas and Stormont and clearly there is a well of goodwill on both sides.  However, we have not yet got it over the line, but I hope we will do so soon.  When I was Ceann Comhairle, we had one meeting in Newcastle, County Down which demonstrated the potential of the inter-parliamentary grouping getting together on a regular basis.  I hope to see progress made on this issue today.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The inquiry into the murder of the solicitor Pat Finucane must expedited as quickly as possible.  The Smithwick tribunal is examining the murder of the RUC officers north of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Britain is our nearest neighbour and if we proceed on the basis that trade is the oxygen of economic activity, the development of further and stronger trade links between this country and Britain is obvious, particularly when there are so many issues of common interest such as the Common Agricultural Policy, of which the next phase is being negotiated at EU level.  Simultaneously there are ambitious plans for the dairy industry in Food Harvest 2020.  In the last year we have seen serious problems for individual farmers who have found themselves with a super-levy problem, while at the same time dairy farmers in the North had surplus quota that remained unfilled.  There are also dairy co-operatives in Border areas which use producers from both the North and the South.  I have been advocating for a long time the putting in place of a bilateral arrangement on this issue; it would be of benefit to farmers and the dairy industry and help with job creation on both sides of the Border.  It is an obvious area and the sharing of quotas would carry no direct cost.  It is a great pity we have not succeeded in convincing the powers that be at Commission level of the merits of this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Many NAMA properties in Britain were built by Irish-based developers.  That is an area in which there a great deal of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Those who spoke at the assembly this week underlined the potential in the health sector.  As a Border representative, I know at first hand of the potential for enhanced co-operation and the development of strategies for more inclusive health care strategies on the whole island, an issue on which I hope progress can be made.  We were fortunate to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at the session to deal with issues in these areas which clearly offer potential for enhanced co-operation and joint ventures.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">We did not deal with one issue that we should examine at subsequent meetings - community relations in the North.  There is no doubt that there is some distance to go in building peaceful and harmonious relationships between communities in the North.  There are areas in which there are still tensions and hostility.  Perhaps they do not hit the headlines to the same extent they did in the past, but as a body, we must be aware of them and ask ourselves how best we can help to develop the more harmonious relationships that would be beneficial to all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Conventional economic activity in the North would be of huge benefit.  Its economy is dependent on the public sector and industrial development has been slow.  If progress can be made on this front, it will benefit everyone on the whole island, particularly the unemployed in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We must look at existing cross-Border bodies.  There is a need to constantly review their role and sharpen their focus and perhaps change direction, where necessary, to ensure they achieve the objectives and goals set for them.  As I said, the establishment of the parliamentary forum would help enormously.  The opportunities for Members of this House to meet on a regular basis with MLAs to exchange views and progress the issues mentioned are obvious.  I hope all those involved can bring influence to bear on those who will decide on how soon it can be established.  Let us hope we see progress in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The victims of the Troubles are mentioned regularly.  While there is no off-the-shelf formula to deal with the issue, there are those who still live with the trauma, grief and bereavement as a result of family members being killed, disabled or maimed because of the Troubles.  We must review this issue to consider how we can provide a support structure and ensure they are remembered as part of the ongoing process of reconciliation in the North.  I hope the issue can be addressed by the steering committee when it is planning the next plenary meeting and subsequent sessions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_343">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McGinley.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-suim aige san ábhar seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I was honoured to be invited to become a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  On one occasion the old British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body held a meeting in Adare in my constituency during the term of office of the last rainbow coalition Government which coincided with the tragic and untimely death of Garda Jerry McCabe.  One thing I have garnered from my membership of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly during the short time I have been a member is that it gives us an opportunity to make personal contact with people with whom we would not otherwise have contact.  This allows us to get a better understanding of the issues they must confront and the manner in which they deal with them.  Often they are similar to the issues facing us.  In addition, it gives us an opportunity on an informal and social basis to build up trust and a relationship that permeates up to ministerial level.  It is important that there is a social element to the assembly as well.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, formerly a member of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, came back to speak to it.  The Taoiseach is a former member of the assembly as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about the assembly.  Three things were to be taken on board by the Oireachtas.  Deputy McHugh has already referred to the first matter.  I congratulate him and Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, on the manner in which the event was chaired.  The first issue I wish to raise relates to muscular dystrophy.  I have a particular interest in this issue.  I noted at the assembly that one cannot have a situation whereby every hospital in Ireland is able to offer an expertise for every rare illness.  However, there is a facility available to parents of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Newcastle-upon-Tyne through using the E112 form.  It is important the procedure is allowed to continue and I made that point strongly to the Minister for Health.  I was glad that my colleagues supported my remarks and that the Minister intends to come back to me on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Two proposals came from the head of Glen Dimplex.  The first relates to an opportunity to be provided to Irish civil servants to do a stint in the United Kingdom, and <i>vice versa</i>, on a voluntary basis to get an understanding of how things work there, what works and what does not work.  The second proposal involves trade missions being swapped on a biannual basis between Britain and Ireland.  They are to be led at prime ministerial level, either by the UK Prime Minister or the Taoiseach, to show that there is a symbiotic relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is worth a good deal of money on an annual basis across the Irish Sea in terms of the trade between the two countries.  Sometimes there is a temptation to forget those closest to us.  Our closest neighbour is also our largest trading partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I was speaking to my colleague, Deputy Wall, before I rose to speak in the House.  As a result of this week's programme, the bar has been lifted high for the British side on the return leg to Glasgow.  There is no doubt the calibre of speakers and the location gave great credibility to the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly by virtue of the fact that it met in the Chamber of a parliament and the fact the Taoiseach was present.  The same should be expected on the return leg.  That is not to put any pressure on our British colleagues but they have seen a full and engaging programme.  All members were delighted by the manner in which it was organised.  Credit is due to the clerks and those who organised it.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">It is important the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is given an opportunity to feed into the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  At that stage there will be proper parliamentary representation and ministerial decision-making as well as having the Executive represented at the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  There is a great opportunity for the assembly to liaise with the two ministerial councils.  I call on the co-chair to take this on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_349">I thank my colleague for giving me some of his time to speak.  I agree with the remarks of my colleagues on the importance of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly having an input and role in the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  I have been a member of the British-Irish body since the last general election.  I commend Deputy McHugh on his role as co-chair as well as the Irish officials on organising what was an outstanding programme that made up the recent meeting which took place from Sunday to Tuesday.  The quality of the content and speakers and the events organised were noted by the British members of the assembly.  I commend all involved on organising the meetings.  They made a significant impact on people, especially those outside of Ireland who took part in the proceedings during these two or three days.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I agree with the previous speaker in respect of some of the important points raised during the assembly.  The nature of the assembly is that specific issues are dealt with sometimes, but the primary function is to build relationships between public representatives on this island and neighbouring islands.  It is and has been a successful organisation in terms of building these relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I was struck by the comments of Deputy Kirk earlier.  He remarked that he represents a Border constituency.  I represent a constituency that is a long way from the Border but there are many individuals and businesses in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny with significant links especially across the Irish Sea.  It is important that Members, who perhaps are not representative of Border constituencies but who are interested in fostering these links, have the opportunity to do so.  I was struck by some of the contributions during the two days of the meeting.  Reference was made to muscular dystrophy and how there is a facility available in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the UK and the importance of keeping that facility available for those who suffer from that particular debilitating illness in this country.  Reference was also made to an issue which has been ongoing for several years, that is, the reciprocal acceptance of penalty points in jurisdictions on both sides of the Border and across the Irish Sea.  This is an area in which the assembly has some input.  It appears we may be moving towards a reciprocal arrangement in all jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I commend the Ministers who took part in the discussion.  Three members of the Cabinet were present: the Taoiseach, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Health, as well as the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes.  They contributed to worthwhile discussions and stayed to answer many questions, often on specific issues raised by members of the assembly.  There was a full and frank exchange of views between the members and the Ministers who turned up.  I commend them for their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I look forward to the next assembly, due to take place in Glasgow towards the end of the year.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of how events such as this bring representatives together.  I note how far we have come in terms of the relationship between politicians on all sides on the islands we inhabit and the nature of the close relations now compared with some of the uncertainties and doubts in the not too distant past.  It is about normalising relationships.  That is the term we use.  The British Irish Parliamentary Assembly is an easily identifiable arena where these relationships can be normalised.  I wish the assembly continued success in future.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I see the co-chair, Deputy Joe McHugh, across the Chamber.  I commend him for the excellent job of co-chairing what was a most successful gathering of the assembly in the Seanad Chamber earlier this week.  The BIPA has been in existence for 20 years.  Much has changed on this island and between these islands during these two decades, much of it for the good.  This is especially the case with the peace process in the North.  With the dawn of peace and the end to hostilities, people have had the time and space to get to know each other and to understand each other a good deal better, especially the Unionist and republican communities in the North.  The imagery of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness travelling to America together seeking inward investment for their people, and then Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness doing likewise, is powerful.  Many events have taken place in recent times that were successful.  I acknowledge that the initiative that saw the Queen of England come here last year was a success and a sign that the relationship between the peoples of these islands is healing.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In terms of what we do with that, it is now time to take it to the next level.  I know Deputy Joe McHugh, as a representative of the people of Donegal North East, would share that view.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, also represents the people of Donegal.  We know the impact of partition on our county and how the potential of our county was hampered by having two health services, two education systems and two taxation systems.  Effectively, we had two economies back to back in that small region and we need to break that down step by step.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We have had positive developments such as the sharing of cancer services with Altnagelvin hospital going ahead.  That was a cross-party, cross-community campaign and even when it appeared to be under threat from the northern end, Unionists and Nationalists, all political colours and creeds, stood together and defended that important piece of health infrastructure for our region.  That was only right because there are half a million people in the north west of Ireland, and we need the same equality as everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">In terms of the A5 project, we now have motorways from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Belfast, and rightly so, but we need the same infrastructure coming into the north west of Ireland.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island.  Half a million people live in the north west.  We have a population broadly similar to the south west and we need the same infrastructure.  We are looking for equality, nothing less or nothing more.  That objective must be advanced, and we can do that through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">More important than addressing the deficits in the north west caused by partition and the Administrations in Dublin and Belfast not seeing our part of the island is the potential for the all-island economy.  I had the honour of serving on the board of InterTrade Ireland for more than three years where I saw academic institutions in the North being connected to businesses in the south, and vice versa.  It had a vision for all-Ireland infrastructure, preparing for a population of 8 million by 2020, and people combining their skills.  This is a small island of 6 million people.  It is interesting that there is no opposition within unionism for what Unionists call common sense co-operation in terms of building an all-Ireland economy, harmonising our approach to taxation and having a joint approach whenever we go overseas.  We should not have a situation where Invest Northern Ireland, IDA Ireland or Enterprise are singing from different hymn sheets when they promote job creation overseas.  We should promote the potential of the entire island.  We should bring together science parks and academic links, and do everything we can to join up the dots of this island because we are in this together.  That is the key objective of the BIPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">We also need to develop our understanding of each other as a people.  For hundreds of years there has been conflict between our peoples.  It is only in recent times that we have had breathing space.  There must be that development of that relationship.  I am also conscious that the BIPA includes representatives of the Northern Assembly, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Assembly, the Isle of Man and Jersey but the Northern, Welsh and Scottish Assemblies represent democracy being brought closer to people and giving them a sense of identity and purpose with which we in Ireland can work in partnership.  When one has conversations with Assembly members from Scotland and Wales the sense of connectedness they have with Ireland is interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">We must look increasingly at the BIPA as an assembly that can deliver, that has teeth, stands together and speaks with one voice on key objectives.  I suggest that an all-Ireland economy, addressing the infrastructure deficit in the north west of Ireland, sharing health and education services and making use of the resources we have in an intelligent, common sense way must be at the top of the assembly's agenda to be addressed in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I commend the Co-Chairman who did an excellent job.  It was a well put together, high level session attended by the Taoiseach down to all the Ministers, a range of civil society players and business players who spoke about practical ways we can co-operate and who were generous in taking a wide range of questions.  The amount of time given by senior politicians in Ireland to engage on the different issues was noticeable.  I agree with the previous speaker that the bar has been set high for the next session in Glasgow, and we can take it from there.  Well done to the Co-Chairman, and I look forward to working on a practical basis to see what we can develop together through the assembly.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I am delighted to speak about this important body.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom comhgairdeas a ghabháil leis an gcathaoirleach, an Teachta Joe McHugh, and his co-chairman, Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP.  In particular I commend Deputy Joe McHugh on the excellent manner in which he arranged and conducted this plenary session in Baile Átha Cliath.  It was a show piece, and I thank the officials and the clerks for their work, including the previous clerk who was honoured at a function the other night for his work in the past.  We set a very high standard in Dublin which is to be envied by Scotland, Wales and Britain.  I am not saying they have to live up to it but I hope they do.  We put our best foot forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The session was attended by captains of industry.  It was a high powered session attended also by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Transport.  The Northern Ireland Secretary attended also.  I have been to Brighton for one of the sessions.  I have been a member only since the election of this Dáil and we had nothing like that calibre of Government Ministers or a Taoiseach at that session.  It is important to give credibility and a sense of recognition to this body.  As the Taoiseach stated, England is our closest partner and is closest to us economically.  That was not the case in the past when we had many differences but in time we left those behind because developments are taking place in Europe on an hourly basis and we do not how much we will need Great Britain for support.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I refer to the back room staff who worked diligently, not just on the Sunday night, the Monday and the Tuesday but for months in advance of the session.  I am sure they will need weeks after it to tidy up the various arrangements.  On the first night in the Shelbourne Hotel I was delighted to get the fine history from David-----</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I compliment Deputy Jack Wall who did tremendous work and Deputy Arthur Spring, who is the rapporteur for our economic committee.  We had two visits to London followed by a return visit here to prepare a report on the lack of funding for small business.  In case we think the position is better in England it is experiencing the same problem with the banks.  They will run out of money in 2014, which is startling.  The credit union and business representatives we met spoke about having the same problem of access to credit.  Despite the funds we have provided for the banks, they are still not lending.  We must remove some of the massive debt the country owes and did not create - it was created by European banks, mainly German and French financial institutions - before trying to deal with the rest of the debt problem.  Failing that, the ship of Europe could sink, but I will not dwell on that issue today.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I am delighted to be a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which should be supported.  In that respect, I acknowledge the support shown by the Taoiseach and Ministers at the assembly's meetings this week.  I note also that a number of its committees with which I am not involved also produced reports.  The assembly's meetings are not junkets but a forum in which serious and valuable work is done.  I we heard the views of guest speakers, including, for example, the chief executive officer of Glenn Dimplex, to whom Deputy Joe McHugh referred, and a lady from a company in Dungarvan which provides a large number of jobs in Port Láirge.  An MP from across the water asked the lady in question some serious questions about the pharmaceutical industry in general and her company, including questions about commodities and the industry's failure to step up to the mark.  As a Deputy from the south east where the company in question provides such employment, I found the discussion interesting and worrying.  Pharmaceutical companies must stand up to close scrutiny, irrespective of where they are located.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">As well as completing a great deal of serious business, members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly also do a great deal of socialising.  I was delighted, on my first visit to Áras an Uachtaráin, to meet President Higgins and listen to him make an historic, inspiring, interesting and cultured speech.  He light-heartedly informed us that he had spent a long time in the Seanad and referred to the Chamber's beautiful ceiling.  I visited the Seanad for the first time the following day to view its ornate ceiling.  The President was funny and delegates were well looked after in Áras an Uachtaráin.  We had a wonderful visit after which we visited Dublin Castle.  We may end up in Buckingham Palace some day if we remain on the committee for long enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The weekend was packed full of debate, discourse and discussion.  Some heavy hits were also landed in the plenary sessions.  The meeting was beneficial to our islands and long may the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly continue.  I compliment those who established the body in more difficult times.  It is noteworthy that its meeting in Brighton last October coincided with an anniversary about which many people wanted to forget.  While many on the other side of the water resisted the proposal to hold the meeting in Brighton, it was an interesting experience.  Everyone involved met in peace and harmony and there was very little security evident.  Much more could be done, but we have moved far along the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The chairman of the economic group on which I sat, Deputy Jack Wall, did tremendous work and we learned many valuable lessons, not least that there was no point in being insular.  It is important to travel and engage with people who have different views and ideas.  Britain is experiencing the same problems as Ireland, albeit on a larger scale, given the size of its economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Deputy Joe McHugh and officials are planning a further plenary session in March 2013.  I look forward to the Gathering in 2013 on which the Cabinet, notably the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is working.  Irish people, whether at home or abroad, are resilient and proud.  Bringing Irish people living abroad back to the country as part of the Gathering will provide a great boost.  Some of them may develop a new grá for the country and decide to stay and invest their money and expertise.  The Gathering is based on the meitheal concept.  I look forward to its various elements, whether in the areas of culture and heritage or the economy.  It is important that we work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Previous speakers criticised cuts in the funding allocated to the A5 road from Monaghan to the North.  The Government has provided initial funding of €15 million for the project.  Such a financial commitment to roads in other areas on this side of the Border would be widely welcomed.  We are in difficult times, but the commitment has been made and the seeds sown.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Discourse, dialogue and interaction do nothing but good and we make new friends all the time.  I thank everyone involved in the meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, including officials.  It was significant that it was held in the Seanad Chamber.  It is good that our guests enjoyed the event because they will return home and tell people how hospitable and jovial we are and that we can have a bit of craic.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The media may be lashing Deputy Ann Phelan on the issue of caviar, but she is doing her best to promote a local, indigenous company in her native Kilkenny.  We must support all indigenous companies, even if it means being slagged off in the media.  Comhghairdeas leis an committee.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon</from>
          <p eId="para_384">It is important that Deputies have an opportunity to address the House on the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I am pleased to do so and honoured to be a member of the assembly representing this House.  As the Tánaiste noted, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly is not only about Northern Ireland.  Its work shows how relations between Ireland and Britain have matured during the years to the extent that Irish security matters no longer dominate proceedings.  Its discussions are now more focused on east-west and cross-Border business and trade opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is important to note that 42% of Irish exports go to Britain and that Ireland is Britain's fifth largest trading partner.  The United Kingdom exports more to Ireland than Brazil, Russia, India and China combined, which is a startling figure.  More than €1 billion worth of traded goods cross the Irish Sea every week.  We have the tendency to take this for granted and sometimes do not realise the importance of our near neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">As chairperson of the Fine Gael Party's internal committee on agriculture, I was particularly interested in championing the potential growth of our food and drink exports through my role in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Britain is Ireland's largest food and drink export market and <i>vice versa</i>.  If the ambitious target of expanding output and growing exports by more than 40% in this decade, as set out in Food Harvest 2020, is to be achieved, we will need to grow the British market further.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I was pleased to be able to question Eoin Tonge of Greencore on the company's sugar strategy and its view, as a major food producer, of the sugar industry.  The decision to cease sugar production here was a major mistake.  The high cost Irish companies are paying to source sugar and the difficulties they are experiencing in accessing supply prove this point.  It was good, therefore, to have an opportunity to drive home this view which is shared by many farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I also welcomed the opportunity to discuss with the co-chair of the meeting, Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, whose constituency includes the Cheltenham racecourse, the potential for greater synergies between the Irish and British horse racing and breeding industries.  I have a great deal in common with Mr. Robertson, given that the Curragh and Punchestown racecourses are in my constituency.  It is interesting to note that he chairs the all-party parliamentary racing and bloodstock industries group in the British Parliament, the purpose of which is to promote the racing and bloodstock industries in parliament, inform Members of both Houses about them and serve their well-being.  There is great merit in having such a parliamentary group and perhaps we should establish a similar group in the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Irish racing and breeding industries employ in excess of 17,000 people and have an annual value to the Exchequer of close to €1 billion.  The British racing industry is worth £3.7 billion per annum and employs 20,000 people directly and a further 70,000 indirectly.  In the light of current proposals to change our betting tax regime, I noted with great interest recent changes announced in the UK budget.  Ireland and Britain are both seeking to expand their tax bases by introducing a remote betting tax regime, a change with which many countries are struggling.  While I am aware that officials in his Department are working hard on this issue, the Minister for Finance must avail of the opportunity to urgently introduce proposed changes for a remote betting tax regime.  Today Paddy Power announced a year-on-year increase of 241% in mobile phone betting revenue.  Some 38% of sport betting stakes on <i>paddypower.com</i> came from mobile phone users.  I welcome the success of Paddy Power which is a large employer in Ireland, but these figures illustrate the betting market is changing.  It is vital that the Government adapt to that changing market and take an appropriate level of taxation from it.  This would, in turn, help to fund the horse racing and breeding industries which are vital to the country.  In Britain the return to the Exchequer in betting revenue is €131 million, while the return to racing is €84 million.  In Ireland the return to racing from betting revenue is €27 million, but the return to the Government is zero.  This needs to change.  There is potential within the industry to grow this revenue and I urge the Department of Finance to do so as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I have enjoyed my work on the committee chaired by Deputy Frank Feighan.  Much work needs to be done on commemorations.  It is important that we get the mood right in marking the many commemorations that will take place in the next ten years, particularly the centenary of the 1916 Rising, as well as the contribution of Irish people in the First World War.  We must also acknowledge the sensitivities of all citizens on the island with regard to these occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I look forward to the work continuing between the plenary sessions of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly when much work is done.  I again thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to address the House on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">This is a confession.  I have not said this before publicly.  I can only say I was led astray as a misguided youth.  However, I had a great experience.  In the period between the general election and the first sitting of this Dáil I travelled to Westminster where I met some Conservative Members of Parliament, one of whom was Mr. Brooks Newmark.  As a result of that meeting there was a bilateral meeting between the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the UK Minister with responsibility for small and medium enterprises.  Because our parliamentary systems are so similar, there was a sharing of ideas.  This is a good example of how parliamentarians in our two countries can work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">In January another Conservative MP, Mr. Ben Gummer, introduced an idea about tax transparency in the British system.  I saw this and got in touch with him.  We started to work together and in March I was able to introduce the Tax Transparency Bill 2012.  While that Bill is different from the work he is doing, it would not have come about without his initial idea and help.  This is another positive example of the work done between our Parliaments and the things we share.  There are connections outside the assembly which also does very good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">There is a socialising element to the plenary sessions, as Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned.  I was not included, unfortunately.  The next time the plenary session is held here it might be an idea to invite Members of the Oireachtas to some of the social events in order that we can make these connections.  One never knows what they might lead to in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_398">Fáiltím roimh an deis labhairt ar an ábhar seo.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Mattie McGrath had been in Áras an Uachtaráin on only one previous occasion.  He might consider spending his political retirement within its hallowed walls as President.  Who knows what would happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">It was good to see our colleagues from the North of Ireland sitting in the Seanad today.  I hope this is an indicator of what can happen in the future when representatives of all of Ulster, not just of three counties, might sit in the Oireachtas.  We would like to see that sunny day sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I agree that much of the focus needs to be put on the issue of trade.  A previous speaker observed that Britain was our largest national trading partner.  It should be noted, however, that there is a deficit in our trading relationship with Britain.  Imports from Britain outstripped our exports to Britain by €228 million in the first three months of the year.  There is potential to reverse that deficit, grow trade through increased exports and produce a surplus.  We should look at some of the sectors in which that could be done.  Yesterday the Central Statistics Office released figures demonstrating the increase in exports in certain sectors of the economy.  The chemical and pharmaceutical sector showed the greatest increase and the highest proportion of exports.  While that is to be welcome, it is important that the Government does not put all our eggs in one basket and that an effort is made to diversify in and promote other sectors.  Too much pressure on one sector means it can be exposed to changes in the world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Yesterday's figures also noted the strength of the agrifood industry.  Most Deputies come from constituencies in which the agrifood sector is important.  Unfortunately, it has been the Cinderella of the Irish export market.  In the first three months of last year it contributed €685 million in exports and experienced an increase of €31 million this year.  It has huge potential.  It has the potential to create wealth and jobs in every corner of the State.  The Government has been focusing on foreign direct investment and high-tech industries, rightly so.  However, it is also important not to forget that large sections of our society are excluded from these high-tech industries because they do not have the communications infrastructure necessary for their development.  If we can progress agrifood industries, we can sustain jobs and growth in all corners of the State and create wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">My own county of Meath is a leading producer of potatoes and a significant producer of beef, barley, milk, wheat and root vegetables.  Our farmers would welcome an opportunity to showcase our quality produce in the export markets of Britain.  I welcome the decision by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to support an annual British-Irish trade mission which I hope will focus on the quality of agrifoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Many small agrifood producers have latent capacity to export but do not have the necessary skills or experience.  We need a programme within the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that would identify these producers' target markets in Britain.  The target markets would then be warmed by marketing activities and made aware of the producers here in Ireland; trade visits would be organised; the small agrifood producers would be hand-held on these trade missions and departmental officials would sit in with them during initial meetings until they had won their first export customers.  These first few steps in seeking exports are easy for a large business but very daunting for a small agrifood producer.  The Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility in this area should focus on this issue and help small agrifood producers, not only in County Meath but also throughout the State, to take their first steps in the British market.  It is also important that these small producers be up-skilled in marketing and have the necessary communications technology to develop websites in order to warm their target markets and sell directly to them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_405">I congratulate the co-chairman, Deputy Joe McHugh, who is present in the Chamber, and his co-chairman, Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP.  I especially thank Deputy McHugh for the arrangements he made for the occasion and its historic nature in that the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, met in the Seanad Chamber.  It is a long time since there was such a strong ministerial presence at a BIPA meeting, which included the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  That added a new level to the event.  As Deputy Patrick O'Donovan stated, it set the bar very high for future BIPA meetings.  I heartily congratulate Deputy McHugh in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Many issues were discussed.  Deputy Heydon referred to the sugar industry.  Deputy Ann Phelan and I share his concern about the fact that the industry was lost to this country through a lack of initiative on the part of Government and the company involved.  The statements made were true and factual in terms of the effort to reinvigorate the industry.  The sugar industry would back up the agriculture industry which is going so well at present.  If we could reinvigorate the sugar industry it would be another jewel in the crown of the agriculture sector and would mean this country would move away faster from the economic downturn to a positive situation.  The spin-off effect of the sugar industry had to be seen to be believed.  As a former employee I saw it at first hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">As Deputy Mattie McGrath indicated, I was chairman of a committee.  I sincerely congratulate and thank Ms Jullee Clarke, the clerk of the committee, and Ms Judith Boyce, her counterpart in the UK, for the time and effort they put in to ensure we got such a representative range of presentations at all the meetings we held in London and Dublin.  Some of the conclusions that were reached should be read into the record of the House.  Small and medium enterprises are one of the pillars of recovery from the current situation.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_408">1.1 Small and medium sized businesses are of huge importance to the economies of Ireland and the UK, and a thriving SME sector will be an indispensable ingredient for economic recovery.  We are encouraged to hear about the many initiatives which have been put in place by both Governments to engage with the sector, promote its growth and ease access to finance.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_409">1.2. If SMEs are to have confidence in provision made for them by the banking system, it is vital that accurate, consistent information about bank lending is available.  The SME Finance Monitor survey in the UK, and the analysis of the Credit Review Office in Ireland, are both invaluable in this regard.  We support the CRO's efforts to publicise its service more widely.  It is also important that SMEs be encouraged to make formal applications for finance and have access to the support they need to do so.  This support includes access to skilled and knowledgeable staff in bank branches.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_410">1.3. In the present economic circumstances, it is likely there is some suppressed demand in the SME sector for bank credit.  However, as the economies of our countries recover, demand will surely far outstrip supply, particularly as there will be no quick remedy for some of the identified current issues, such as a concentrated banking market.  The UK's Breedon Review has highlighted an alarming prospective shortfall of bank lending over the next four years, a finding which has important repercussions for Ireland as well, given the importance of UK-based banks for the economy.  Businesses will have to look beyond the banks, to non-traditional finance streams such as equity funding, angel finance or peer-to-peer investment.  Both Governments also need to respond urgently, firmly and imaginatively to the implications of the Review.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_411">1.4. This is new territory for most small businesses.  They will need support to take advantage of non-bank finance options: expertise either in-house or readily available from trustworthy external sources, clear and timely information about what the options are and how to access them, and Government action if necessary to promote a diverse range of finance routes.  We urge both Governments to prioritise these actions so that our small and medium sized enterprises can reduce their dependence on bank lending over the longer term.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Those are some of the recommendations of the committee.  We hope that at some stage in the near future one of the committees will take the report on board and hold an in-house debate to allow a wider scope for Members of both Houses to contribute.  The report should be used as a launch pad for the recovery of SMEs that are so important to our economic recovery.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I echo the sentiments expressed by all Members and congratulate Deputy Joe McHugh, the clerks and all the team for organising what was a splendid and worthwhile event.  The fact it was held in the Seanad Chamber was not just an historical moment which added significance to the event but also lent itself very well to real engagement with the issues.  By virtue of the fact we are all parliamentarians and politicians, the surroundings of a Chamber enhanced the debate in a way that is not always possible in a hotel environment.  That, in itself, added to the quality of the debate and interaction during the assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I was struck in particular by some of the speakers from the food industry.  Much has been said about the food sector and agribusiness.  Ms Darina Allen spoke about how she believes this could be one of the key drivers in terms of tackling youth unemployment.  That is something on which all of us must take action.  We also heard from Greencore and other businesses.  Greencore, which is involved in the food industry, said it could not get people to work in the food industry.  It is incumbent on us to forge links between the food industry and the further education and third level sector to ensure we have graduates who will find it attractive to pursue a career in the area and be able to drive the industry.  Currently, we have a thriving export market for raw materials but it is the combination of processing and innovation that adds value and will secure jobs in the future and create more sustainable employment.  The Waterford Institution of Technology, WIT, has invested a significant amount of money - €35 million – in the food and tourism area.  We must engage with industry to ensure we have graduates who will bring about innovation, add value and create employment, in particular in the south east where we currently have almost 20% unemployment.  It would be a tangible result from the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  That will be my mission in the coming weeks and months in the BIPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I commend the work of Lord Alf Dubs on flooding.  He delivered a report to the plenary session.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has read the report and will take it on board.  We are aware of the devastation flooding caused to many families throughout the country in the past 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I thank the Whips for allowing this discussion to take place in the Dáil.  It adds significance to what was a productive and historic meeting on the occasion of the 44th plenary session.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I will not repeat what other Members have said.  However, I thank Deputy McHugh and Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, for the way they go about their business and do such a good job chairing the assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I wish to talk about the part I play in the assembly.  I serve on the economic affairs committee - committee C - where most recently we compiled a report on the small and medium enterprise sector.  I thank Deputies Jack Wall and Arthur Spring for their contributions.  The report is detailed and very important.  It lays down much of the foundation for addressing the challenges and opportunities facing small and medium sized businesses in the coming years.  As Deputy Jack Wall observed, the SME sector is enduring great difficulties in the current economic climate.  In particular, businesses are experiencing enormous problems in accessing finance.  The report predicts that between now and the end of 2016, owing to "stricter requirements", the banks will not be in a position to supply the finance needed to support the growth potential in the small business sector.  That will be a major challenge for Government in both of these islands.  We will have to look beyond the banks to non-traditional financial sources to support the SME sector, which will be a challenge in itself.  SMEs are of critical importance to our economy and that of the United Kingdom and a thriving small business sector is an indispensable ingredient for economic recovery.  As such, I am encouraged by the initiatives that have been put in place to engage with the sector, to promote its growth and to ease the path to finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I take this opportunity to address a misleading and mischievous article in one of the national newspapers yesterday which sought to portray me as some sort of Marie Antoinette figure who, instead of saying "let them eat cake", was saying "let them eat caviar".  Deputy Joe McHugh understood the point I was making, which was to point out the excellent job creation opportunities that exist in the artisan food production sector.  I gave the example of a company in my constituency which is the first to produce caviar in Ireland.  This seemed to me a very good news story, but the newspaper in question turned it on its head.  I acknowledged when I made the point that I might well be pilloried for it and, sure enough, my computer is hopping from the abuse being heaped on me for seeking to put caviar on the menu in the Dáil restaurant.  The newspaper article certainly left a bad taste in my mouth.  With friends like these, who needs enemies?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy John Perry)</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I add my voice to that of the Tánaiste in commending the hard work of the Co-Chairmen in organising such a substantial and timely programme for the plenary meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  The plenary theme of making business easier is one that is very close to my own heart and goes to the core of what we are seeking to achieve in developing the British-Irish relationship.  The backbone of the Irish economy is made up of the 200,000 small and medium sized companies which between them employ 700,000 people.  There is great potential there for trade between North and South and between this State and Britain.  Likewise, making business easier is of equal concern for the small business sector in Britain.  An important part of the development of the British-Irish relationship lies in facilitating the potential for inter-country trade and export-led growth for both countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I pay tribute to the work of the Co-Chairmen of the assembly, Deputy Joe McHugh and Mr. Laurence Robertson, MP, for their work.  Likewise, I thank the civil servants in both jurisdictions for their vital support for the assembly's activities.  While the assembly meets twice a year, the value added by the ongoing work of the committees between plenaries is immeasurable.  In particular, I thank Deputy Jack Wall and his committee for bringing forward a very useful and timely report on the small and medium sized enterprise sector.  Both Governments are focused on lifting our respective economies and restoring confidence and access to credit for business.  Many speakers referred to the ongoing difficulties experienced by small business in accessing funding.  The banks in this country are now sufficiently recapitalised to ensure viable small companies receive the necessary funding to allow them to grow.  Given my portfolio, I have a keen interest in the work of Deputy Wall's committee.  I will read its report with interest and consider its conclusions carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Several Deputies stressed the importance of the British-Irish economic relationship for the prosperity and well-being of the people of both our islands.  As noted in the joint statement by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, economic co-operation will be a cornerstone of our strategy of deepening relations in the years ahead.  In that regard, I look forward to meeting the members of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce which has recently commenced business.  The suggestions raised in the course of the plenary meeting are extremely valuable  and will play an important role in strengthening British-Irish co-operation into the future.  In particular, I note the useful suggestion arising from the session with the business leaders that standing trade missions between Britain and Ireland should be organised on an annual basis.  Enterprise Ireland has identified 1,800 companies to which it will offer support to avail of the potential to export into Northern Ireland, Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  It is notable that the priority areas for action identified in the joint statement and in the plenary agenda very much mirror each other.  The agrifood sector, in particular, is doing outstanding work, with exports of €9 billion last year.  In this context, I welcome the initiative shown by the company to which Deputy Ann Phelan referred.  It is vital that such businesses are supported.  Trade missions to Britain are of great importance in exploiting the export potential that exists.  It is clear that we are all on the same page as we strive to deepen the relationship between Britain and Ireland in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I note the motion passed by members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly expressing concern at the proposed closure of the RTE studios in London, as referred to by several Members in the course of this debate.  I am fully aware that this is a matter of regret for many in this House and for members of the Irish community in Britain.  However, it is ultimately a matter for the authorities in RTE who, like all of us, are faced with a very challenging financial climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I thank Members for their contributions to this debate and commend those colleagues who participated in the plenary meeting.  It is very important that the vital ongoing work of the assembly is brought to the attention of all Members and of the wider public.  Unfortunately, it might well be the best kept secret in our democratic system.  The live streaming of the debates and the use of social media are important steps forward in that regard.  We must get out the good news of the co-operation that is taking place not only by way of the assembly but also via the cross-Border bodies and InterTradeIreland.  There is immense opportunity for the SME sector in this collaboration.  A debate such as this serves a very useful purpose and I hope we will again review the work of the assembly following the next plenary meeting in October.  I compliment Deputy McHugh once more on his outstanding work.  The staging of the plenary session in the Seanad Chamber added to the ambience of this worthwhile debate.  My role as envoy for small business involves a significant engagement with InterTradeIreland and efforts to enhance cross-level co-operation, including by way of trade missions to Britain.  In terms of the diversity of opportunity in artisans foods and so on, there is an immense opportunity for businesses to grow and develop.  The assembly has a critical role in enhancing economic co-operation for the business people who are the backbone of this economy and on whom we depend for the creation of jobs.  Britain's market of 60 million people offers immense opportunities in this regard and it is an area in which IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively engaged.  I compliment everybody who has participated in this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">It is not just with pleasure that I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Credit Guarantee Bill but also with sheer elation.  On a daily basis in my constituency office in Dundalk I meet people who are distraught about the lack of credit opportunities for their businesses which are usually small, with ten or fewer employees.  Quite often they are labour-intensive and located in the lesser urban areas.  In addition, they are often family-run and have employees who have been with the business for more than ten years.  These business owners are not charlatans or property speculators or operating in the black economy.  Most often they are the family-focused, pint-drinking, GAA-following people of Ireland every one of us in this House knows.  They are part of the fabric of our society.  They create jobs in their local communities and add value by spending their profits and wages on other local services and in supporting local business providers.  This Bill may not be the complete solution, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I have met constituents who operate in business parks such as those in Tenure and Ardee, as well as Quayside Business Park in Dundalk.  They may be seeking to expand their businesses, with resulting employment creation, but their efforts are being stifled by a lack of credit in the banking sector.  Some industries are more reliant on credit than others.  More importantly, some high potential start-ups are in greater need of lenient credit terms, as they are not in the same bargaining position as some of their more established, bigger and often international competitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">By our very nature, Irish people are entrepreneurial.  We have come from the land and if agricultural people are not entrepreneurial, I do not know who is.  Throughout the expanse of north County Louth, particularly the Cooley Peninsula, there is business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit in abundance.  It needs an outlet to thrive and there are supports available.  One has only to visit the Regional Development Centre on the campus of Dundalk Institute of Technology to be inspired.  The centre houses some of the brightest and highest potential businesses in the country.  They may only be in incubation, but they will need capital and credit to expand and deliver their world-class offerings to the market.  The Bill will help to ease the way for companies such as these to grow, expand, create wealth and, ultimately, sustainable jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I will recount a small lesson I learned from a Dunleer constituent when he called to my office recently.  When he left university in the late 1990s, the country was totally focused on the SME sector.  Small businesses were cherished and valued, their proprietors were held in esteem and the banks were understanding in their dealings with these companies.  Somehow, in the next ten years and under previous Administrations, the focus was changed and the emphasis was placed on multinationals and international companies.  Welcoming and encouraging international companies to locate in Ireland was certainly no bad thing, but by completely ignoring the indigenous SME sector, previous Administrations did a disservice to the lifeline for Irish society and communities throughout the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly, as it is a step in the right direction.  If implemented correctly and the banks adopt it in the spirit in which it was designed, it could prevent the litany of queries I receive on a weekly basis from constituents in places such as Laytown, Collon and Termonfeckin.  The message is always the same: "If we can't get credit, the business will fold."  This means three or five jobs will be lost.  In one case two weeks ago eleven jobs were on the line.  I applaud the Minister for introducing this legislation which I commend to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_434">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this extremely important Bill.  In the current difficult financial climate access to credit for small and medium sized businesses is crucial.  The Bill is an important step in providing a platform that businesses can use to drive their enterprises forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Small and medium businesses are the lifeblood of the economy.  Job creation by large multinationals investing in Ireland is most welcome, but it is the small and medium business sector that is the real barometer of commercial life in Ireland.  That barometer is indicating stormy weather.  Businesses which are still standing after the economic tornado of recent years are operating because of canny management, courage and determination.  Now they need to plan for an expanded future and credit is the key to putting these plans into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Bill provides for a three year partial credit guarantee scheme which will see the State providing a 75% guarantee to banks on loans that qualify for the scheme.  It is envisaged that the scheme will facilitate the injection of €140 million into the small and medium business sector for each of the three years.  It is important to note that the lending that will take place as a result of this mechanism will be in addition to, rather than instead of, normal day-to-day bank lending to enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The cost of lending during the three year lifetime of the Bill will be €19 million.  This will be money well spent.  The size and nature of the guarantee involved and the sums of money to be lent are dwarfed by some of the guarantee facilities available in other EU countries.  For example, Italy's largest public guarantee fund, SGS, guaranteed €4.6 billion worth of loans in the first six years of operation.  Many OECD countries have similar programmes.  For example, the guarantee in the Netherlands is up to 50%, with up to 75% available for start-ups and innovative companies; Belgium and the United Kingdom offer 75%, the same guarantee provided for in the Bill; and in Germany up to 80% is guaranteed, with the average being between 50% and 80%.  It is worth noting that the Bill provides a guarantee for a duration of three years, as opposed to the lifetime of the loan.  This is somewhat shorter than those on offer elsewhere: in the Netherlands the guarantee is for a maximum of six years, or 12 if real estate is involved; in Denmark and Belgium it is up to ten years; and in Germany it is up to 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Bill is just one part of a suite of supports the Government is establishing to help small and medium enterprises.  I am glad to note that it takes a common-sense approach to the matter, simply removing some of the risk for banks contemplating loans to small businesses.  Further supports must also be established and further efforts made to drive down the costs faced by small and medium businesses, including costs imposed by central and local government.  Rates are a major issue for many small and medium businesses.  The upward spiral in rates went somewhat under the radar in the distant days of the Celtic tiger, but in these days of extremely tight margins, they are causing difficulties.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has taken some commendable steps, including amalgamating councils, in an effort to drive down costs, but it is time to have a national conversation about the nature and extent of local government and the level to which small and medium businesses can be expected to contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Given the well publicised events of recent years in the banking sector, when calamitous and imprudent lending decisions were made, the pendulum appears to have swung to the other extreme, with banks proving to be positively risk-averse and turning off the flow of credit to small businesses.  The Bill will do much to address this issue in the next three years.  It will, I hope, allow small and medium enterprises across the country to access the credit needed to put their plans into action - plans that are the key to Ireland's economic future and a healthy and thriving commercial sector.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelHarrington" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Deputy Noel Harrington</from>
          <p eId="para_440">I welcome the Bill as another small step in the programme of recovery for the country and another commitment in the programme for Government that has been achieved.  In a recent speech the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Professor Patrick Honohan, highlighted the fact that credit conditions for SMEs were tougher in Ireland than anywhere else in the eurozone, in terms of both cost and availability.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It is welcome that we are designing this scheme with a considerable amount of hindsight.  According to a World Bank study in 2008, there were 76 similar schemes operating in 46 countries which were obviously developed or OECD countries.  Thus, in many respects, we are behind the curve in introducing a credit guarantee scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I hope this scheme will encourage growth in our enterprise culture.  We must recognise that some of these enterprises may fail or have a need for further capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I would like to see reporting or reviewing of the results of this scheme.  I encourage the Minister to stipulate, as a fundamental part of the Bill, that he must present, before the summer recess next year and in the following two years, a short and comprehensive report to the Oireachtas enterprise committee outlining the loans advanced, the enterprises and jobs involved and the cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">We must remember the banks are the main beneficiaries of the State guarantee scheme and the citizens have invested billions of euro in equity and capital to guarantee their commercial viability and future.  We now need to encourage the banks to extend the scheme to the SME sector, which is struggling the most and which is of such benefit to the economy.  In doing so, we need to examine the role banks will play not only today but also in five, ten and 20 years.  We must have a cultural change in our banks and learn the lessons we have not learned to date.  We did not reform the banks after the ICI debacle, the DIRT inquiry or the Rusnak affair.  I remind Members that Munster Bank failed due to fraud and mismanagement and was liquidated in 1885.  It was taken over and became the Munster and Leinster Bank, which eventually became AIB.  We must not return to the old ways or we will be in the same position again before we know it.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The main purpose of this legislation is to encourage the banks to provide credit to small and medium sized viable businesses to encourage growth.  We need to create a new enterprise culture in our banks which are risk averse due to their recent history.  We must recognise those who are prepared to put their heart, soul, hard labour, time and money into their businesses.  I am well aware the banks are suffering from what could be described as excessive analysis or, to put it another way, paralysis by analysis.  We need to see a seismic shift in the role banks play in society.  With the State's equity investment in our pillar banks, we are in a unique position to reform the banking system.  Too often, bank branches are becoming administrative rather than decisive, especially in small provincial towns.  This is leading to a stasis in lending which needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I would like to see the banks taking in personnel from the business and commercial sector and sending their personnel to that sector on three or five year contracts to create a greater understanding of what occurs on both sides of the financial divide.  The funding should be invested in a wide variety of industries, thus lowering the risk involved.  Bearing that in mind, I hope a wide variety of enterprises will be capitalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I am aware agriculture is not directly included in the scheme but I hope potential products linked to the sector will not be excluded.  The experience of the agriculture sector of a small engineering company in my constituency which has created a number of jobs and successful products, particularly in regard to health and safety around the farm, is invaluable.  It would welcome increased access to capital.  Will somebody who develops a new cheese product, for example, and who needs new machinery to expand production be able to avail of the credit or will he be disadvantaged because he will not be able to obtain a loan guaranteed by the State in the order of 75%?</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I am very concerned about the attitudes in banks with regard to assessing projects that are typically outside the building sector.  Banks had ready access over the past decade or so to quantity and property surveyors who told them the costs, potential liabilities and risks associated with construction projects.  The financial institutions are lacking in expertise to assess other ventures.  This is a fast-moving world and entrepreneurs are coming up with new ideas every day.  There are new technologies and I am not sure the banks have the expertise to assess projects that could be very beneficial to the economy.  These are cast aside because the banks are unable or unwilling to deal with them.  They just do not know how to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Let me address the 2% fee involved in the scheme.  I ask that it be centred around the cost of administration such that lenders are borrowers will not be inhibited solely on the basis of the fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Ireland is not short of initiative, entrepreneurship, guts or hard work.  It is very short of capital, however, and the Bill is an effort to address this.  Perhaps, through thinking outside the box, the Department will take on board a proposal for concessions.  There are tax concessions for employee share options.  It would be interesting to see the Government offering tax concessions or reliefs to employees of small and medium enterprises who want to invest in the companies in which they work.  Very often, an employee who inherits cash or obtains money from selling property might want to invest in a scheme that would offer benefits, such as a pension fund.  Could such an employee not invest in the company in which he works while availing of a tax benefit as if he were investing in a pension scheme?  This would make for a better employer and employee.  It would, perhaps, free up capital in regard to a manufacturing or working base.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Government is drafting new personal insolvency legislation.  I would like to see the end of the guarantee of the family home as part of the lending process.  It is simply not on any more that entrepreneurs who approach a bank are asked to put up their family homes as collateral.  This dates from the bricks and mortar mentality in which the banks are stuck.  They are in a rut and cannot see beyond the value of the family home.  I would like to see legislation passed that would exclude the family home from consideration as collateral.  The entrepreneurship, initiative, hard work and track record of those seeking a loan should be used as the collateral required by the banks.  Too often, the family home is used and, too often, it is decimated as a consequence.  That is wrong and I would like to see an end to it.  The courts recognise the right of the wife and mother to half the value of the home.  Let us complete the circle by recognising the rights of the husband and father.  Let us take the family home out of the lending arrangements for commercial finance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Bill is being considered in the context of the crisis we have been enduring for the past four or five years.  It attempts, in a small way, to address some of the deficits indigenous SMEs have had to encounter in recent years.  I am led to believe over 60% of SMEs are refused funding by their banks when they approach them.  The proportion is probably much higher because small businesses are deciding not to bother even applying for funding from their financial institutions because they believe they will not obtain any and that the banks are not open business.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The Bill is being considered in the context of our owning 98% of one of the pillar banks.  In effect, we own it.  The Government has made much play about the fact that there has been €5 billion extra made available for lending in the economy this year.  If this is the case and if funding is being made available to the small and medium enterprises, one wonders why there is a need for a credit guarantee Bill to kick-start lending to small businesses.  The €150 million guaranteed under the scheme is very small by comparison with the €5 billion that is supposed to have been loaned already through the pillar banks.  Although we own 98% of one of the banks and have a large shareholding in another, we still cannot get the banks to lend to the domestic economy, which is carrying the brunt of the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">When one is told daily in the Chamber about job announcements, it is interesting to note they are all a result of foreign direct investment.  The Government is pinning its hopes on foreign direct investment alone as a means of job creation.  Last week, the Taoiseach, responding during Leaders' Questions, spoke about how people will in future work for four years for multinationals and then move on, probably, I believe, because the multinationals will move on from Ireland, thus making the employees redundant.  The Taoiseach stated the nature of work is changing.  I do not believe we should be setting up our economy to be a feeder for multinational companies and foreign direct investment and that people can only hope to get work in those sectors.  We should be targeting the domestic economy in various ways, for example, the potential within aquaculture which can create thousands of jobs if the blockages in the system being maintained by Departments can be got through.  That needs leadership.  It needs somebody within the Department or a Minister to take hold of and drive that process.  That is not happening.  Such actions are what can make real differences in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">There is also the potential for the creative sector.  In the north west, as I outlined in the House previously, there is potential to create up to 18,000 jobs simply by being assisted to export and being taken in together into mentoring groups.  That is not about guaranteeing credit to the banks.  It is about the Government taking a lead and taking ownership of the issues, removing the blockages that exist for those small and medium sized enterprises, and allowing them to grow and develop themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">It is startling, when one looks at it, that the Western Development Commission, itself a statutory agency, can produce a report that shows the potential to do this exists.  Even if only 50% of it were achieved, one would create more than 10,000 jobs in the domestic economy.  It is unbelievable that not one Department looked at the report, contacted the commission and asked for the basis of it, or checked the report to see whether it was credible.  There was nothing at all.  Apart from assistance through one or two local authorities, which themselves are pinned for cash and unable to help in a real way, that is the only interest in it from officialdom and from the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_460">It is good the Minister of State met them but they need more than meetings.  They need somebody to take ownership of these issues and take a lead on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The Taoiseach stated he met them but there is no point in meeting them if one will not take up these issues and run with them.  This is a statutory agency that should be supported and listened to because the measures to which I referred are those we need to drive this economy.  Those are what we need to stem the tide of emigration that is rampant throughout the country.  Foreign direct investment will not bridge that gap and will not provide the jobs people need in order that they do not have to go to Australia, Canada and the four corners of the earth to find employment for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Bill, as I stated earlier, comes in the context of 1,200 businesses having closed in the past year throughout the State.  It is a small step.  Unfortunately, I believe, it is probably too small a step.  The €150 million limit on the guarantee lacks imagination and a number of criteria within the guarantee itself, specifically the length of time of the guarantee of three years, is on the lower end of the scale across all the international examples.  One could see a situation after three years, especially where we will not be in the position of growth in which the Government states we will be, - at this stage, nobody believes that - that the banks would be cutting off small and medium sized enterprises again and they would be back to struggling hard.  The three year term of the guarantee should be extended, either to ten years or to the lifetime of the loans, to ensure businesses can enjoy some certainty and security if they are lucky enough to get into this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I would also be concerned about the banks' attitude to the scheme, whether they will participate actively in it or engage fully with it, and the restrictions they will place on small businesses to avail of the scheme and make the best use of it in the future.  The Department and the Government need to take that issue on strongly to ensure the banks play the role they are supposed to play of servicing and assisting the economy, not the State servicing the banks and keeping them in business, which has been the situation over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">As has been mentioned by other Members, the 2% annual fee that will apply for qualifying loans under the scheme could place an onerous burden on businesses.  In the case of a business that borrows €1 million, it is looking at having to pay €20,000 upfront for the administration of the scheme.  That could place a burden on businesses.  Can borrow that amount of money as part of the loan or must they have it upfront?  If many business had that amount of cash flow, they probably would not be looking for a guarantee under the Bill.  The Department must look seriously at how that will operate to ensure qualifying businesses do not encounter barriers to their participation arising from the administration of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Overall, the credit guarantee scheme must be welcomed because anything that gets business going and helps the domestic economy, sustain jobs and job creation must be welcomed.  Unfortunately, the €150 million limit is probably too low and the three-year term is probably too short.  Through amendments on Committee Stage, the Minister might consider adjusting those figures and ensure the administrative element of the scheme, the 2% fee, would not be a barrier to companies which wish to participate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_466">The sole purpose of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012 is optics and making it look like the Government will do something for the economy.  The Government can state this was in its programme for Government and now that it has done it, one should shut up, whatever about the detail.  We are talking about €150 million, less than one sixth of €1 billion that will solve all the problems that taking billions of euro out of the economy is causing.  I cannot see how this will solve the problem.  For a start, how does the Government guarantee the banks will not pull back to the tune of €150 million from their current lending levels and decide they will get the State to underwrite for them?  There is nothing, as far as I can see, to guarantee that will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The simple facts are that 50% of small and medium sized enterprises have had credit refused in the past year and this scheme would provide finance for only 2% to 4% of those.  What about the rest?  What exactly are the rest to do?  When one considers that leaves up to 98% of them out, what sort of an impact will this have other than the banks pulling back on lending by €150 million and now lending it out under this scheme where they get more out of it and the Government covers their rear ends?  That does not make much sense.  When one looks at it in the context of what will be taken out of the economy through the fiscal compact which we say will run into tens of billions of euro by the time all of this is finished, how will €150 million make a massive difference?</p>
          <p eId="para_468">In a way, looking at this and looking at all of the other stuff the Government has not done, it suggests the Government's understanding of how a business works is purely on access to credit and has nothing to do with the costs of running a business when it comes to rent.  The Government claimed it would do something about upward-only rent reviews and nothing has happened.  If the Government wants businesses to work, it must do more than provide them with credit, which this will not do anyway.  We are told there is nothing the Government can do about upward-only rent reviews.  The Government should try to say that to those who own property who try to stick by this clause.  In the case of buildings owned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, tenants are being told their rent cannot be reduced because of some rule on upward-only rent reviews.  If the State were really serious about helping businesses, then surely it would take the lead in respect of this matter and reduce the cost of rents.  That might make life a little easier for those to whom I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Another issue which arises in the context of costs is that relating to rates.  Regardless of the amount of credit advanced to businesses, as long as the situation whereby local authorities can waste money left, right and centre and not be held accountable for doing so continues to hold sway, it will never be possible to take action in respect of reducing rates.  The latter are crippling businesses.  When I have commented on this matter previously, Fine Gael has responded by saying it has instructed the councils it controls not to increase rates.  This matter is much more complicated than that.  It will take a great deal more than just telling councillors not to vote in favour of an increase in rates if we are to solve the problem that exists.  There is a need to introduce accountability at local government level because this will bring about a reduction in rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I spoke to a member of the fire brigade yesterday in respect of how the money people pay in rates is spent.  He informed me that one third of the overall cost of running the fire service relates to the money paid to the four people who are meant to be running it and who have never fought a fire in their lives.  Deputies might wonder what this matter has to do with the Bill.  I can inform them that what I am referring to is the type of waste of money which has a direct impact on people who are trying to run businesses.  It is this waste which leads to their being obliged to pay high rates.  Until this problem is solved, any moves in respect of credit will simply involve throwing good money after bad.  There is absolutely and utterly no way that people in business can succeed if they are obliged to pay such high rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The next issue that arises is competition.  Until there is real competition in this country, any steps taken to provide credit to businesses will not work.  The Government had the opportunity to deal with this matter in the context of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2011 but it did not do so.  Instead, it has proceeded with a watered-down version of what is my concept of competition.  There is proof that the Government is not really serious about this matter.  Last week, for example, four members of the Garda Síochána were present in a bog in County Roscommon to ensure that we turf-cutters were not intent on killing everyone in the country or whatever the hell else it is we are accused of doing.  There were twice as many gardaí in a bog on the Roscommon-Mayo border last week than there are to work with the Competition Authority in the context of investigating breaches of competition law.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">If there is no real competition in this country, how are businesses meant to survive? If there is nothing in place to ensure there is real competition, how will such businesses survive?  If there is no accountability at local government level and if rates are not reduced, how will businesses survive?  If the Government does not follow through on its promise in respect of upward-only rent review and if it does not assist those who are struggling to pay rents which are completely out of kilter with what should be the case, businesses will not survive.  When it comes to business, everything in this country is out of kilter.  This means that when tourists come to Ireland, they are obliged to pay twice as much to stay in a hostel as they would be expected to pay at a hostel in the centre of Berlin.  If a hostel needs additional credit in order to remain in operation, what is the point in providing it with such credit if everything else relating to how one runs a business has gone haywire?</p>
          <p eId="para_473">In the context of the Credit Guarantee Bill, who could have a problem with €150 million being provided to businesses.  It would be very easy for people to put a negative spin on matters and state that I do not want businesses to succeed.  My difficulty relates to the perception that the provision of €150 million alone can solve the problem.  This sum is not adequate and there is no guarantee that the banks will not abuse the scheme and try to make more money for themselves, while business people will be left with nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">On "Tonight with Vincent Browne" last evening, I saw a lady discussing the issue of business.  Apparently, if one is a politician, one knows nothing about business.  One has to be a business person to understand business.  Regardless of the nature of the points politicians make about business, apparently they are all rubbish.  I was previously in business.  I actually sacrificed my business to become involved in politics for the greater good of people.  I might return to business in the future but just because I am not involved in it now does not mean that I do not understand the concept.  The same is true of anyone else in the Houses who has previously been involved in business.  Just because one is not involved in business does not mean one cannot understand the Credit Guarantee Bill.  I am a former businessman, I am currently involved in politics and I will most likely return to business in the future.  In that context, I am in a position to state that other than indicating that additional credit will be provided there is little substance to the legislation before the House.  I accept that more than the €150 million to which I refer could be provided but there are no safeguards in place to stop the banks from abusing the scheme.  That is all I have to say.</p>

Many people tend to expel a great deal of hot air about business.  One must be right in the thick of it, however, in order to understand the problems, fears and other issues involved.

          <p eId="para_479">Even though I am tempted to do so, I will not become involved in a slagging match.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Bill is part of a suite of measures - this also comprises the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011, which was recently passed by both Houses, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011 and the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2011 - designed to bring about legislative change.  The Bill is certainly a step in the right direction for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Government has placed jobs at the centre of what it is attempting to do.  The action plan for jobs, which was published a in recent times, refers to the partial credit guarantee provided for in the Bill and states that for every €100 million extra in loans guaranteed under this demand‐led scheme, more than 1,200 small businesses will benefit.  That is good news for everyone.  The action plan also states that access to finance, credit and cash flow remain crucial for small businesses.  I am of the view that the action plan for jobs will in time come to be seen as a seminal document.  In that context, it is similar to the Food Harvest 2020, which applies in the area of agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">There are three main aspects to the action plan for jobs.  The first of these relates to the establishment of a potential exporters division within Enterprise Ireland.  The second involves the establishment of a one-stop-shop, a development which is essential for those who are new to business and who require some direction.  That the action plan will be measured and monitored by the Department of the Taoiseach is crucial.  We should not establish anything that is not going to be policed.  Every three months, the Department will evaluate whether the targets relating to the plan have been achieved.  If they are achieved, that will be great.  If they are not, however, we must ask why that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I am aware of the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, in publishing a 70-page report - I hope other Deputies have taken the opportunity to peruse this - entitled "The Voice of Small Business: A Plan for Action".  Some key individuals who are involved in the area of business in which I am involved, namely, the SME sector, in which there are over 200,000 firms which employ approximately 655,000 people.  Like my business, many of these concerns employ ten people or fewer but they are crucial to the economy.  The big ticket items referred to in the Minister of State's report are access to credit, labour market costs and flexibility and local authority structures.  The short-term priorities to which the report refers are the cost of doing business, access to public procurement, the hidden economy - which is a problem - and competition.  No one is walking away from these difficult issues; they are, in fact, being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I am an employer and I have my own business.  In that context, I am aware that one is only as good as one's next year in business.  Even though someone may have been in business for the past 20 years, he or she cannot definitely state that he or she will remain in business for the next ten years.  There are no longer any guarantees.  The introduction of the Credit Guarantee Bill means the Government is formally stating that even if a bank is not fully confident with regard to one's business idea, one will still have access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The banks will have a guarantee, although I admit the guarantee is limited at 75% of the amount loaned.  The Government is not going to give a blanket guarantee and it will be 10% of the aggregate of all the loans handed out up to a total of €150 million.  I am sure there will be improvements to this scheme, like in any business process where modifications are made, to ensure we get it right and working for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">AIB's David Duffy and Bank of Ireland's Richie Boucher have explained to Members where the banks are at.  They have recognised the mess they created but there is certainly a mood for change with them.  I, along with others, have explained to them that small businesses have been starved of cash flow for the past several years which has been crippling.  Small businesses do not want to stay in limbo for ever and want to move on.  With the engagement of the banks and positive legislative changes such as this Bill, we will see more positive times for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I hate to shout it too loudly but in my area the rural economy is starting to pick up and not before time.  While there are pressures, it is good to see a move in a positive direction such as this measure.  I welcome this legislation but we are mindful there are many other aspects that need to be tackled.</p>

        <speech by="#JimDaly" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Jim Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_488">Cuirim fáilte roimh deis labhatha ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  An article in last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i> stated the desire for economic growth is a little bit like the desire for world peace in that it is universally accepted.  To get economic growth, we have to do more than pay lip-service.  We need to focus and target how we are going to achieve growth to do the heavy lifting and pay off our debt.  Over the past 12 months I have visited many schools in my constituency and tried to explain to students why the economy crashed.  I have pointed out how before the crash we spent our time buying and selling property from each other instead of looking outward as a trading nation, producing goods and selling them abroad.  I have used the analogy of two people behind the counter in a sweetshop buying from and selling to each other but no one coming into the shop to buy sweets.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">My emphasis as a public representative is on supporting the real engine of this economy.  Members from all sides of the House have answers for everything but few solutions.  The answers are the easy bit; the solutions, tougher.  Much time is wasted creating pie-in-the-sky wish lists of improved services, supports and payments.  We must examine what can drive and support this.  These wish lists are worth nothing unless we have an engine to drive and create the finance to fund them.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Recent debates have been dominated by the need for a stimulus in the economy.  Stimulus will stand on its own merits in some circumstances.  However, there is a significant danger that as Ireland is an exposed island economy with a debt overhang, any stimulus of the billions spoken about could leak back out of the economy.  Many economists have recognised this.  On this side of the House we have to be responsible before we bring anything to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">This Bill represents a real and productive stimulus as it supports the heart of our economy and the engine that drives it, that being the small to medium sized enterprise, SME, sector.  While there are, unfortunately, 23 million people unemployed across Europe, there are also 23 million registered SMEs.  If each of these SMEs created one solitary job, it would wipe out the unemployment nightmare that blights society here, in the EU and across the world.  While this may seem an ideal, we have to do our bit as an island economy to work towards that and look further at job creation.  The idea of job creation for many previous Governments was, unfortunately, through creating a bloated and inflated public sector with increased layers of bureaucracy and management.  We have to go back to basics.  We are an island economy which needs to trade its products outwards, get growth and pay off our debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Of the 1.8 million working in the economy, more than 900,000 work in the SME sector, one in very two persons employed.  The SME sector is a significant contributor to public sector employment through the taxes and revenue it raises.  No one claims this Bill is a panacea.  I cannot share the negativity from the other side of the House because any step, however small or big, is welcome towards supporting the SME sector.  I wholeheartedly and unequivocally welcome this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DominicHannigan" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_493">The credit guarantee scheme was a commitment in the programme for Government and I am glad to see we are now delivering it.  We know it is not the silver bullet to fix all the problems faced by SMEs nor are we claiming it is.  However, we are trying to make it easier for SMEs to survive and grow.  Early this year, we introduced the action plan for jobs knowing one initiative is not enough.  As Deputy Barry said, it takes more than just one measure to get the economy back on track.  Our action plan for jobs listed 250 different actions which we are taking to improve the lot of small businesses.  We have introduced in the first three months of this year 96% of the action points that we planned, and we are continuing to deliver on them.  There will be another quarterly review by the end of June which I hope will show further progress has been made.  The action plan is not sitting on a shelf gathering dust like many plans from previous Administrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">We have all heard the stories of businesses trying to access credit and being refused.  They are trying their hardest to make their business grow but are turned down by the banks.  In 2010, one in every two applications for credit was turned down by the banks.  It is more difficult to access credit in Ireland than in any other eurozone member state.  We must make it easier for our businesses to get credit.  I know how important access to credit is for a small business having started my small business in the 1990s.  There are times when one needs a ready line of credit supply to enable the business grow, invest in new facilities or machinery and hire new staff.  People with the drive and ambition to start a small business must be supported.  A thriving small business in a community can make all the difference about how a community feels about itself.  We have all seen towns where businesses have closed down, leaving buildings derelict, a reminder of previous Government policies which have not supported SMEs.  In County Meath, where over 90% of businesses are SMEs employing up to nine people, this new credit scheme will be warmly welcomed and give many businesses the opportunity to develop and grow.  I am very glad an Irish business won the tender for the oversight, management and operation of the scheme.  When I was in Duleek recently, the issue of Irish companies getting Irish contracts came up; it was raised by a small business owner who was extremely concerned about the lack of Irish companies winning Government and council tenders.  He was under the impression that this work was being given solely to companies outside the State.  I know we are taking the issue seriously and I am glad the tendering process has made it easy for Irish companies to win contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I look forward to the speedy passage of the Bill through the Houses in order that we can get the scheme working to assist small businesses and help people get back to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_496">I, too, welcome the Bill.  It is good that we can speak in such a positive manner about the actions of the Government in delivering on the action plan for jobs.  It is a credible plan which will prove to be another step in creating the right conditions for job creation, which it is important to facilitate.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Deputy Thomas Pringle mentioned foreign direct investment and commented on the thousands of jobs being created.  We must concentrate on small and medium businesses and help them to develop and access the funding that will aid this process.  Earlier in the year we saw the introduction of the jobs initiative and the reduction in the rate of VAT which drew some negative comments, but the thousands working in the tourism industry have welcomed it.  I constantly hear positive feedback about these efforts, including the intern programme.  I spoke to one young person yesterday evening who had gained the necessary experience in the market to land a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I note that I am speaking to the converted in the House.  The parties represented in it at this time are urging a "Yes" vote in the referendum on the stability treaty, which will bring certainty.  There is no big bang solution in addressing unemployment and the economic crisis, but small and considered changes or initiatives are required to progress our people towards work.  I listened to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, speak on "Morning Ireland" about the assistance provided from European Investment Bank funds which will be an important aid in getting people back to work.  We must also be honest about the problems arising from the large deficit.  The funding the Government can put into the sector is limited, although very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The credit scheme is welcome.  As I mentioned, it will allow small and medium businesses to secure the loans required to create jobs.  I have seen new businesses being set up, but there is no real experience in banks to allow entrepreneurs to access funding through business plans, especially in the high technology sector.  Before their collapse, the banks were lending with the family home, as mentioned, as well as other property being used as collateral.  If the banks ever had the required expertise, they seemed unable to assess proper business plans when produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The 75% guarantee figure is right and the provision of €150 million in funding is very positive, as it may benefit up to 2,000 businesses.  Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to consider carefully the element of the Bill which details the 2% annual charge to be paid in advance.  When businesses are seeking funding, paying such a charge up-front will be difficult.  It is almost contradictory that money must be paid in advance; therefore, the Minister should consider this element again carefully.  On the positive side, pumping that amount of money into the economy will help to increase tax receipts by as much as €25 million.  Therefore, there may be a balanced approach that could help to reduce the up-front charge or phase it in over the course of the scheme.  In this regard, it is very welcome that there will be a review after one year.  Looking back at a number of initiatives in the past decade, there has never really been an in-depth review to see if processes are operating correctly.  It is important that there be such a review.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I live in the south-east inner city and represent Dublin South-East.  In recent years I have seen the likes of Google and Facebook being set up, leading to spin-off businesses, some of which are running into severe difficulties.  I have seen very good business plans, but the banks are unable to assess them properly because there is no ingrained experience in the system to allow this to happen.  There will be growth in the economy in this area and the necessary expertise must be spread across the banking sector.  As mentioned, the practice of using the family home as security in giving loans is nonsense.  The giving of loans should be assessed on the basis of business plans and there should be further training providing in the banking sector in order to allow proper assessment.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_502">Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.  Like motherhood, it would be very hard to oppose the Bill, as anything that will help business is to be welcomed.  I agree somewhat with Deputy Kevin Humphreys that life is a series of small steps and that rarely are problems, even major examples, solved using a big bang approach.  This is a very small step and I will watch with interest to see how the scheme works in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The Government is putting in place a guarantee scheme, but the banks are already required to lend considerable sums of money - €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion next year.  This scheme has the potential to add €150 million which, and in the light of the other lending figures mentioned, is very small.  How can the State be sure the banks will not use this money to guarantee loans they would have given, thus deleveraging risk to the State?  If we are honest, a properly functioning bank would have the majority of its loans repaid, but there is always has an element of risk involved.  It is written into a business plan that some businesses will fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">During the years I have seen schemes getting bogged down in endless bureaucracy.  I have the same fear for this scheme.  For many, this might just bring about more forms and plans.  By the time some people avail of the guarantee, the good will have gone out of it.  I have stuck to the view that for most businesses, a grant of €5,000 or €10,000 is normally next to useless, as it may cost €15,000 or €20,000 to access it.  The Minister of State is probably familiar with this syndrome.  I have advised people where very small grants are available to not bother looking for them if they will distort their plans considerably.  They would be better off taking the straight commercial way.  Many are tempted by the availability of money through a grant or a loan, but rather than tailoring their plans around it, they should avail of if only if it fits the plans.  Therefore, we should be careful about this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The sample figures tell us much about the scheme.  There are 1,800 businesses, with the average loan being €76,000.  According to this we are talking about businesses with up to 250 employees.  A loan of €76,000 is a very small for an expanding business.  In many cases, it would be a drop in the ocean.  This, therefore, is a micro scheme.  I know many businesses, urban and rural, that are not huge businesses or multinationals for which such a loan would be very small.  It is a lot less than the loan for a single house.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">It is estimated the cost of the scheme is €19 million over three years.  That is a very small commitment on the part of the State.  A sizeable amount of the money for the scheme will come from the people who are going to benefit.  Effectively, there is a 2% penalty on their interest in return for the loan.  That is a significant cost for small businesses.  The idea the State is paying for the guarantee is wrong.  It is paying partially for the guarantee but in no way is it covering the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Then we come to the endless conundrum of the Department of Finance.  The Government is facing the challenges we faced.  The net Exchequer benefit from this is supposed to be €25.5 million.  Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_509">Will someone - perhaps the great Deputy Mathews - explain to me why, if a scheme is giving a net Exchequer gain of €25.5 million, would it not follow that if we invest five times as much in the scheme, given there are potentially five times that number of viable businesses that cannot get money, and I do not believe the difficulties of getting money in this country will be solved with €150 million, would the Exchequer not gain €127.5 million if the scheme was five times bigger?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">Why not review it now?  This goes back to a core principle in the Department of Finance that is a result of Merkel-thought: the State cannot invest money and make money on it, even though the State gets all the taxes from activity.  A huge proportion of the decrease in taxation is a result of the lack of activity in the economy.  Why when the scheme was being drawn up, if it was going to save so much money for the Exchequer, was it not done at a much greater level?</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_517">It is a valid question and I will go further with this theory.  I had this argument many times with the Department of Finance when I was a Minister and all I am doing is encouraging the Minister of State to follow in my path and continue the argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">People talk about investment to stimulate activity and mention building schools or roads.  If these are built with 100% Exchequer funding, there must be a cost to the Exchequer, no matter how much tax it gets back.  I have always agreed with that; it is a rational position.  I have never said the State should spend €5 billion in this time of hardship on 100% State-funded activities because there is no way to get all the money back.  On the other hand, and this is a lesson we must learn, if €2 billion is cut from State expenditure, on a good day the improvement in the net Exchequer position is probably only 50% of that when extra social welfare costs and tax losses are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">If, however, there is a 35% grant for something that would do long-term good in the economy, such as improving the thermal quality of private buildings, residential or commercial, to reduce heating bills and oil imports into the long distant future, it would give long-term savings.  There was talk earlier about the real economy but there can be an absolute real economy in a closed circuit if it is not necessary to import goods.  The idea of exporting allows us to buy in services but if we can eliminate the need to buy some of those services, we do not need to export as much to have a trade balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Presuming we gave a 35% grant to improve the thermal quality of buildings, there would be a long-term gain but what are the short-term economics?  If the grant is only paid to those who are legally registered and pay taxes, when the sums are done, the savings in social welfare, and gains from PRSI, VAT, income tax and universal social charge, USC, payments, never mind the builder spending money, give a net gain in cash.  The Department of Finance is caught in a mathematical corner on this and will always say it is dead weight.  That would be a fair argument if people were going to do these things anyway but we know people are not doing things, that things are paralysed.  There are many people who would take up these incentives if they were provided but we do not make them available.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is important we look at this question and see how we can break out of the vicious circle we are in.  We must recognise that focused grants can give a good return on expenditure.  There is a fundamental difference between a grant that stimulates activity or gives other ancillary benefits and paying 100% of an investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">A Deputy mentioned the fiscal treaty and the referendum.  One positive thing that has happened, and I publicly thank the people of France for it, is that they effectively voted "No" to the Sarkozy-Merkel paradigm of cutback, cutback, cutback.  As I keep saying, every €1 billion in cutbacks takes €500 million out of the tax base, meaning we are constantly chasing our tails.  I am delighted that already there has been a change of attitude in Europe and that investment in jobs and job creation and economic stimulus has now come into vogue.  I wish the Taoiseach well next week.  I hope he comes back with a great heap of Structural Funds, which appear to be waved everywhere, and money from the European Investment Bank and so on.  However, when he comes back with all this money and the big purse next week, the next question is how we spend it.  Do we spend it in a way that stimulates extra activity, draws in other money and draws out a good portion of savings, or do we spend it in a way such that we do not maximise the multiplier effect?  We must be careful about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I hold considerable reservations about the wholesale sale of State assets.  I do not go along with the philosophy of some of those who believe they have a monopoly on proper thought in Europe.  They seem to have an ideological hang-up about the State owning essential services and they believe these services should be privatised.  I do not share their philosophy.  Let us consider the sugar company.  Where is it?  It is gone.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_539">Does Deputy Buttimer agree with that?  Naturally, he agrees with it.  I was not in Government and was instead a Senator at the time of the sale of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann but I do not believe it was a good idea in hindsight.  We believed we had put in place the protection of the golden share, but it was not very golden when it came to the point.  Having learned my lesson, I am not keen for the Deputy to sell more State assets.  It seems to me a foolish idea.  I do not agree that selling the retail side of Bord Gáis Éireann is a good idea.  It is somewhat strange to be selling the company to which the Government has just given the contract for water.  Perhaps that can be explained to us someday.  Can the Government explain how it is no cause for concern or grief that it might sell the water services?</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I welcome the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to ensure the proceeds of the sale of State assets would be invested rather than going straight into debt reduction.  If we are to proceed in this way, my remarks about the multiplier effort should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">We should consider the long term.  We need to get the economy going and this, in turn, will give the Government the money to provide basic services.  As I stated at the beginning, I believe this scheme is microscopic.  No one could argue against it as far as it goes and I hope it works.  I will be watching with interest to see whether it gets bogged down in a plethora of bureaucracy, whether it adds extra lending or whether it is simply used as a way for the banks to hedge their bets and ensure they are not exposed.  However, it is all on a micro scale.  Where has the €20 billion investment bank gone?  Where has the bank gone that the Labour Party was to set up with €20 billion from God knows where?</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_543">That decision was made before the election.  Those in the current Government knew all about it when they promised the €20 billion.  I am simply asking where it has gone.  The idea was good but the figure was outrageous.  I do not know where we were supposed to get €20 billion from.  Under this scheme the banks will run rings around the Government.  Perhaps the old idea of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, or the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, would be better.  They were modest State banks.  It is fair to say many businesses received money from them when the ordinary banks would not lend it, and those banks worked profitably.  They also had a significant stimulation effect.  If a person approached one of the regular banks looking for money and they had no wish to do business, that person could always go to the ICC or the ACC.  Given all the traumas that have taken place with the banks, it would be a good idea for us to hive off some institution as a business bank.  It need not be exactly the same as the ACC or the ICC.  It could be an agricultural and industrial credit corporation that would not get involved in property.  It could have a remit limited to agriculture and industrial development.  It could be a modest bank rather than the €20 billion bank referred to.  That could be enough to stimulate the market and ensure the other banks were made aware that if they did not lend money to potentially good businesses, there were other firms watching which might be able to fill the gap.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">Five minutes is tight.  It is barely time to make two lightly boiled eggs or to get across some points which I believe are important.  I refer to Deputy Ó Cuív's closing comments.  A bank balance sheet of €20 billion would require capital of no more than €2 billion because there is a multiplier effect when one takes into account capital, good management and the direction of a bank.  One expands the capital by taking deposits and with those deposits one can expand one's lending activities and investments.  That is what may have been intended in the programme for Government.  Anyway, I will not get distracted because we are discussing the Credit Guarantee Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterMathews" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_547">The sentiment, objectives and aspirations of the Credit Guarantee Bill are worthy, of that there is no doubt.  It attempts to focus on the small and medium sized enterprise sector in our economy.  It is the largest employer in the economy and it is starved of cash and credit at the moment because banks have been in a terrible, unattractive haste to correct their balance sheets since the collapse.  By correcting their balance sheets they have, wherever possible, drawn in loans and tightened credit.  This has been at the expense of many indigenous businesses in the country.  Effectively, there have been two distinct economies in recently years: the multinational corporation and foreign direct investment funded economy on the one hand and the home grown national enterprises, the target of this Bill, on the other.  The Bill is relevant for firms with employment levels up to 250, turnover and sales revenues of up to €50 million and a balance sheet size of €43 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">A total of €150 million of loan guarantees could be provided in what is termed a portfolio arrangement whereby, for example, the two remaining banks could divide the annual portfolio of €150 million equally between them, each taking €75 million.  Effectively, the Government would be exposed for 75% of that €75 million per bank and the claims in any one year would be restricted to 10% of that 75% of the loan exposure.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Bill does not refer to three year lending, portfolios or an annual review.  It refers to a review on two months notice.  The Bills digest contains worked examples and demonstrations of what is in mind, what it could cost and the benefits that might follow in terms of employment generated by businesses that would benefit from having their loan liabilities guaranteed to the extent of 75%, subject to the cap of 10% of claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Working through the demonstrative models the Department of Finance has provided in pages 19 to 22 of the explanatory memorandum, it is worthy to see that, based on certain assumptions, the hope is that 1,800 jobs would be provided.  If that happened, there would be further spin-off effects because there would be income taxes from those earnings, VAT on the expenditures of those net earnings and so on.  It is that fan effect that is good for the indigenous economy because the indigenous economy, unlike the multinational corporation, MNC, economy which is currently earning export surpluses, has been contracting.  That is the one that employs about 1.5 million people whereas the MNC economy employs up to 250,000 people depending on one's measurements.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Deputy Ó Cuív also mentioned the ICC and the ACC.  I worked in the ICC for 20 years.  The target objectives of bringing credit into Irish owned businesses was achieved over a 70 year period where every year from 1933 until the time I left in 1988 there were steady, increasing profits.  It was an academy of hallmark banking where the structure of the balance sheet was maturity balanced in a proper fashion in terms of the maturity of the funds that were invested in the assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">There was a venture capital side too, and some of the venture capital companies that the ICC supported are massive successes on the world stage, Tullow Oil being an example.  Tullow Oil has a market capitalisation of approximately €6 billion.  That started in a small way, promoted by Aidan Heavey and his colleagues.  Two former ICC colleagues of mine joined that board.  There are many other examples of companies across all sectors of the economy that have done extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Let us hope there is not too much bureaucracy in this credit guarantee scheme and that it encourages a return by our main banks to proper appraisal of businesses and cash flow lending where executives and managers understand the customers, products, suppliers, all those balances and the management of the companies they support.  The sentiment, aspirations and objectives underlying this Bill are good, although it needs to be tightened up.  I suggest in a memorandum form attached to the Bill there should be worked examples to ensure people can understand it, as has been shown in the worked, demonstrative example on pages 19 to 22 of the explanatory memorandum.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_554">I refer to the contribution of the previous speaker, Deputy Mathews.  As someone who was involved in banking for many years I always welcome his contributions on matters such as this one.  He represents the very best of the old style banking that may have become unfashionable in the time of the Celtic tiger but which we need more of now.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I welcome the Credit Guarantee Bill.  It is important promised legislation to help release vital credit for small and medium enterprises throughout the country.  While I disagreed with most of what Deputy Ó Cuív said in his contribution, he raised an issue on which it is worth having some clarification, that is, the potential for this scheme to displace lending that existing financial institutions might already be in a position to give.  I hope there will be some comfort in that regard for the Deputy and me in the Minister's closing remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I express some concern about the prospect this scheme might put extra administrative burdens on businesses.  It is important it would be timely in that when people apply for credit, the existence of this new scheme would not delay the process of administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Ó Cuív's comments on €70,000 to €80,000 of a loan being insignificant.  For a small enterprise employing five or six people that can be the difference between surviving and not surviving.  The Government is correct in ensuring that if there is full uptake of the scheme, which may be modest at the outset, it can be expanded in the future.  That is logical.  There is no point in announcing a grandiose scheme, and Deputy Ó Cuív and his colleagues did a good deal of that in their 14 years in Government, if it will not be acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Deputy Mathews is correct in his view on the current position of the economy in terms of the foreign direct investment sector and our exports being buoyant, but it is accurate to state the domestic economy has contracted considerably in recent years.  This scheme is directly targeted at improving the domestic economy where most of the people who work in the economy are employed and where most of the room for potential expansion within the economy exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In announcing the legislation the Minister, Deputy Bruton, spoke of the potential for these measures to have a beneficial effect for 1,800 small and medium enterprises throughout the country.  That are many small and medium enterprises with huge potential for job expansion, and if we are to come out of our current economic difficulties, it is those small and medium enterprises in each small and large community throughout the country that are most likely to generate employment in those communities.  Anything that will assist them in that regard is to be greatly welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In his concluding remarks I ask the Minister to address the concerns raised about the potential extra administrative burden that might be created and to address the concern with regard to the possible displacement of loans which might already be granted by the financial institutions as a result of this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_561">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  Undoubtedly, the Minister of State, in his role as Minister with responsibility for business, and I use that word deliberately because he is a pro-business person, will have been informed by many businesses, as have many of us, that they are having difficulty accessing credit and that our banks are risk averse.  In his contribution Deputy Ó Cuív referred to small steps.  This is a significant step in that we are saying to people in business involved in creating employment that this Government is listening and wants to encourage and help the creation of access to credit and liquidity.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The language on the AIB small and medium enterprise business lending application form has changed in that it refers to three easy steps to applying for business lending which include arranging a meeting with one's relationship manager, completing the enclosed application form, and gathering any additional supporting documentation or information that may be required by the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Our banks must work with employers.  Deputy Mathews is correct.  There are two sides to the economy.  There is foreign direct investment and the indigenous economy.  We must assist our local economy and our local employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">This is a three year partial credit guarantee scheme providing €150 million, which is in addition to what the pillar banks supposedly will lend.  It is a continuation of the programme for Government commitment, the action plan for jobs, the Minister's own proposals and the Voice of Small Business.  Through his actions, words and office the Minister of State has lived up to his commitments.  He is doing what it says on the tin and trying to deliver in a proactive manner.  I wish him success because we need him to succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Access to finance presents a major problem.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, has provided figures from an internal survey which indicate that 50% of companies which had made applications for credit to banks in the previous three months were refused, that 91% of firms which had applied for funding believed the banks were making it more difficult to access finance and that 92% of respondents believed the Government was having either a negative or neutral effect on the availability of finance.  I regret this is the case as businesses must have working capital and overdraft facilities to allow them to restructure and continue to trade and provide employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Many business people are afraid to apply for credit.  People I meet in my clinics, while canvassing or at social occasions have told me they have returned home from their bank with a loan application form only to decide later not to bother submitting an application as they believed their bank would refuse them credit.  When large numbers are deciding not to make loan applications, we must ask what we want the banks to do and what position should they be in five to ten years from now.  According to a EUROSTAT survey, Ireland had the second largest decrease in the success rate of loan applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Deputy Eamon Ó Cúiv spoke about providing a stimulus for job creation.  Long before President Hollande arrived on the scene, the Taoiseach spoke in this House and elsewhere about a stimulus, investment in job creation and making Ireland the best country in the world for small business.  He has taken a consistent approach to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Ceann Comhairle probably despairs with me at times but having listened to Deputies opposite refer to a stimulus and the sale of State assets, I must point out that they were absent without leave for 14 years, during which time they abandoned all regulation and principle.  Some of them appear to have forgotten that the principle of collective responsibility applies to the Cabinet.  While I share their concerns about the sale of State assets, it was the Fianna Fáil Party which sold off Telecom Éireann with wild abandon and to great glee, as most of us recall to our cost.  They need only consider the position of Eircom now.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">As someone who is concerned that we must not rush into a fire sale of State assets, I welcome the approach taken by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, respectively.  The latter made it clear on "Morning Ireland" earlier that we needed a stimulus and investment.  Deputy Peter Mathews is correct that we must create jobs in the domestic economy and focus on indigenous employers and markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Foreign direct investors are awaiting the outcome of the referendum.  I hope we will vote "Yes" in two weeks, as it would send a message to the world that we are open for business, in charge of our destiny, confident about restructuring and in a position to redeem ourselves across the world.  If one contrasts Greece and Ireland, one finds that we are taking bold and imaginative initiatives, although I accept that people are paying a price for our efforts and there is, unfortunately, pain involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This morning the Select Committee on Health and Children, of which I am Chairman, approved an Estimate of €14 billion for the health service.  Someone needs to explain to me how a country with a population of 4.5 million can spend €14 billion and end up with what some consider to be an inadequate health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">It is imperative that a stimulus programme be introduced.  Rather than frightening people, the banks must work with them and encourage and inculcate an entrepreneurial attitude.  Having been a public servant for my entire working life, I have only lately converted to the view that entrepreneurs are vital to the development of the economy.  The Bill is a small and important step that seeks to get credit moving in the economy and ensure the banks are open to working with people.  As someone who has been critical of the banks, I was heartened by remarks made by the AIB chief executive at a briefing yesterday.  Banks cannot operate in an ivory tower or expect people to flip-flop whenever they jump.  Working with people does not only mean offering loans.  They must do so in a spirit of partnership and provide rewards and encouragement.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">While I am aware that the scheme provided for in the Bill will be subject to annual review, it would be preferable if it were assessed on an ongoing basis to allow us to tweak it, where necessary.  We must get the domestic economy moving to allow businesses to develop.  The credit guarantee scheme is necessary because the banks became dysfunctional when they failed to maintain a diverse business base and put all their eggs in one basket.  I hope the legislation will help to develop a small and medium enterprise sector that will deliver a significant number of long-term sustainable jobs and become the lifeblood of the domestic economy as we face into a new type of economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Instead of the banks and the Government standing in the way of doing business and economic growth, they need collectively to change their behaviour and culture to facilitate expansion and growth.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, for his approach.  He may be quiet, but he is also a man of steel who will, in time, be seen to have played a key role in turning around the economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_575">I concur with many of the sentiments expressed by previous speakers.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the Bill and note its interesting Title.  As a businessman, the Minister of State understands business.  Deputy Peter Mathews worked in banking for years.  Earlier in the week in Private Members' time we discussed legislation introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath which sought to introduce important measures to remove from society vultures who were demonising people and driving them to despair and, in some cases, suicide.  I hope this Bill, with its simple Title, will do what it says on the tin.  I know it has been drawn up in the correct spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">As a Deputy who supported the previous Government, I voted for the banking guarantee in the belief there was no other way.  I have regretted that decision ever since because the banks fooled us and tricked the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, and his officials.  They have also tricked his successor, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Last week the Secretary General of the Department stated he did not have enough staff.  He certainly does not have enough staff who understand what makes businesses tick.  While I am not being critical of the officials present or other departmental staff, the Department needs new thinking.  For this reason, all new staff should come from the private sector and have stood behind counters or machines, built their premises, paid tax, insurance and VAT and dealt with all the regulations some of the officials in the Department love to dish out.  We need a sea change in how small indigenous businesses are dealt with because they must be nurtured.  They are smothered with regulation after regulation and will not be able to survive.  I am not arguing against the Bill, but as I stated last week, for every new regulation that comes from Brussels we add at least nine or ten more besides.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The industry that gets most support from all of this is the printing industry, and much of this business goes abroad because of ineptitude in our procurement procedures.  We cannot be imaginative as other countries are and divide large contracts into several parcels so they do not have to be tendered throughout the EU.  Paperwork is arriving every morning in the letterboxes of small businesses.  The postmen are weighed down with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I listened with interest to Deputy Peter Mathews.  We should all listen to him.  He has experience of banking, and not with the banks I call the magnificent seven who threw credit at everyone and almost forced us to take money.  Deputy Mathews worked for the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, which was a brilliant bank when I was a young fellow.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, which the farming community set up, was also a good bank.  Those banks were restricted in who they could lend to and chose to be that way.  They served the country well.  They gave to businesses and had a rapport with their borrowers.  A small amount of credit can stimulate a lot and will bring returns to the Exchequer in PRSI and VAT as well as creating customers for insurance, fuel, printing and other services.  This all turns over the economy and gets it going.  That is how it got going.  We can never forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We welcome multinational companies and foreign direct investment and want more of them but the cost of bringing them into the country is considerable.  They are welcome and we must nurture them and attract more of them.  However, we must go back to recognising and believing in indigenous businesses, whether consisting of one self-employed person, a family, or five, ten, 20 or 100 employees.  What has happened in recent times is not helping these businesses.  We have a difficulty at present in my county where a new company is taking over from Bord Gáis and wants to tear up the contracts its customers had with Bord Gáis.  The existing contracts are not being respected and standards are not being applied.  I have a similar concern about the company that will be given the water franchise.  I will elaborate on that issue at another time, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  Today, we are talking about banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The two pillar banks did not provide the €3 billion in lending.  They were expected to present a business plan to the previous Government, of which I was a supporter, but extensions and further extensions were granted.  The plans, when they were eventually presented, were rejected by the Minister and they went back to the drawing board.  The banks led us on a merry dance and never loaned the money.  They told blatant untruths and said they were lending the money but did not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">At present, I am in the process of changing from being a sole trader to forming a limited company.  I had an overdraft as a sole trader but my bank told me I could not transfer the overdraft to the limited company.  My good name should be sufficient to bring the overdraft across.  I have been in business for 30 years.  A bank will seek any way it can to turn off the tap.  As Deputy Mathews said, they are interested only in increasing their own balance sheets and not in the good of the country or in helping business people. Senior bank management, not the ordinary bank staff, are determined to make themselves look good and prove they can do enough to be promoted to the top jobs where they can be great boys and be paid more than €500,000.  It is all fundamentally flawed and wrong.  It cannot work, it will not work, it did not work and it will never work.  We must change tack completely.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I welcome the Credit Guarantee Bill, but I hope the €150 million it provides will not be sucked in by the banks and used to avoid lending the money they are supposed to lend.  Banks are overstretched.  One does not need to be a genius to know that. Half the money we owe to banks, including the former Anglo Irish Bank, should be written off.  This is the message the Taoiseach must bring to Angela Merkel next week.  The European project could be unfolding on its feet.  This is worrying.  The Taoiseach must bring the message to her good self that it was mainly her own banks, and the French, who pushed money in here when our own banks were broke.  They continued to fire money into Ireland and now the Irish taxpayer is having to pay back this money.  This must stop.  We must cut off at least half that money.  Last night, I discussed this matter and the promissory notes with Deputy Mathews.  We must print more money and park this debt.  It is not within the energy or ability of the Irish people, now and for generations to come, to repay that kind of money.  It is just not possible.  We have to do what the Americans and British did.  I do not know how many trillions of dollars the Americans printed.  We must do that and remove this huge legacy debt.  It was not created by the taxpayers or ordinary people but by speculators and banks who were allowed to do so by the regulators, who were well paid but did not do their job.  The same is true of Ministers and officials of the previous Government, of which I was a supporter.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">A crazy situation took place.  Banks used to ring us up, tormenting us.  In my business, if I was considering buying a machine, the company would tell the banks about it, or they had some way of finding out.  On the following morning, I would find four cars in my yard, with one bank competing with another to give me a loan.  If two small farmers wanted to buy the same 30 acres, a bank would finance both of them unknown to each other up to a crazy amount of money.  That should never be allowed.  I know that safeguards against such practices are built into the Bill, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The Minister of State is a business man and knows all about this.  He must do so, to have been so long in business.  I know he is doing his best, but his best is not good enough because these people do not care about the Oireachtas or the law.  Bankers have gone abroad, having broken the country.  One banker in Bray was invited to the Garda station in Bray for questioning.  We did not see any paddywagons pulling up at his door to take him away.  On the other hand we saw five detectives coming in three cars to the house of the former Deputy, Ned O'Keeffe, in connection with an alleged misdemeanour amounting to a couple of thousand euro.  What is wrong with the country?  We cannot deal with the big bad fellows but we can deal with a former Member who gave good service to this House as a Minister of State and Deputy for decades, as did his family before him.  He suffered humiliation and trauma.  His wife had gone shopping when he was arrested.  He is recovering from medical treatment.  The detective gardaí did not want to give him time to change from casual clothes into the more formal attire he always wears in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">This is what the public find so horrible.  Ordinary politicians and ordinary people of every hue can be hauled before the courts and made a show of.  Of course, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, but if one throws enough muck it will stick and if a dog gets a bad name it will never go away.  The big fellows receive a telephone call and are asked if they are available to come to the Garda station.  What is worse, who informed the media that three Garda cars from Cobh - and what did that cost - were on their way to Ned O'Keeffe's home?  Who alerted the media to be waiting at the Garda station?  It was disgusting.  I accept the media must do their job, but who informed them on that occasion?  Why should they be informed?  The man is innocent until proven guilty.  If he has to be brought in for questioning, that is fine.  I do not say anyone should be above the law but there should be fair play.  That was not good enough, it is not good enough and it is going on wholesale.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Ordinary business people are being driven to distraction by bankers, the Revenue and all the agencies of the State.  I compliment the south Tipperary coroner who spoke at the inquest of a good friend of mine who had a business of long standing.  Revenue officials came to him at one o'clock one day and said they would be back at three o'clock to collect X number of euro, which he did not have.  A customer came in at twenty minutes to two and found him dead, by his own hand, in his shop.  That kind of bullying is going on and it is all because we are trying to pay back this bank debt, which we cannot. We did not accrue this debt.  We do not owe it.  We could pay back half of it, or thereabouts.  I am not an expert in figures.  We should pay back a manageable amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Every country is in the same boat.  That is why people are rebelling in Greece and elsewhere.  In next month's election we might see the hard left gaining support in Greece.  I am not against the left but I have worries about the hard left and where it might bring us.  If this spreads, what kind of Europe will we have?  It might come here too.  I was a supporter of the previous Government.  The present Government promised to do so much.  It promised to burn the bondholders but burned no one except the people.  Will the people accept that the next time?  I would be fearful they would not and of where they might go with their votes.  We have a democracy and we must respect that.  The people are entitled to vote for whoever they wish.  However, we must show the cause. We cannot trick the people.  They are too sensible for that and too hard-hit in their pockets and their hearts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_590">I am speaking to the Credit Guarantee Bill.  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  This is all relevant to the money we do not have.  We are passing the Bill, and I welcome it, but I do not want to see it hijacked by the banks.  They have hijacked everything else.  That is why what I am saying is relevant.  Instead of the €6 billion the two pillar banks are supposed to provide annually, they are not putting in even €1 billion between them.  I cannot prove that but I know from the evidence I gather from meetings in my clinics, in my social life and in my discussions with farm organisations and agricultural contractors that it is not happening.  People are not going into banks because when they ring up about loans they are told to just forget it.  Many people who go into banks do not get past the counter.  The banks are manipulating the figures to say they have lent to so many people.  Less than 40% of those who make inquiries about loans in banks get to meet the manager and discuss their business plan.  The majority of those who want loans are rejected.  The figure we get is not accurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I am pleased with the safeguards included in the Bill.  I worry about who will be the contractor.  One could ask why the apparatus of the State is no longer able to do such things.  Is it the case that we will have to resort to a consulting company again or will we have to put it out to tender?  What is wrong with us at county council level and elsewhere that we cannot do anything ourselves any longer but we have to seek outside help?  I do not say outside help is bad but consultants are consuming too much energy, time and money in the State.  The money must be put where it is needed, namely, to put small businesses back on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I welcome the reference to qualifying enterprises.  I know who they are.  Anyone with any nous for business knows who they are.  It is important that the fund is not hijacked and that it is guaranteed.  I worry about the 2% surcharge.  I accept there are no free lunches but small businesses need a clean start.  In the first instance, indigenous businesses need the money to get going.  They could perhaps be charged at a later date.  I do not say live horse and you will get grass but small businesses are downtrodden and on their knees at the moment.  They are bursting with ideas and energy but they just cannot get beyond the red tape.  They cannot get loans to get up and going.  We must devise a way to allow them to put their worries about paying the banks to one side and let them act as job creators and innovators which they can be and will be.  The longer that is going on, the more they are being downtrodden.  That is a problem.  Small businesses are losing the will to carry on and they are throwing in the towel.  If they do that they do not get a shilling in social welfare.  I accept the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is examining the issue.  We must reward those people, encourage them and above all we must allow them to stimulate the economy and get us back on the road to recovery.  We must do that at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">A total of €20 billion is available in an investment bank.  Deputy Mathews referred to that also.  The sum of €2 billion would probably be enough given that the money would trickle down.  The bank would attract deposits according as people saw it as an attractive business venture.  There is money out there.  People have it in all kinds of places.  I would not like to see anything happen similar to what happened in Greece this week, namely, a run on our money.  There is money out there and people will invest in a proper investment tool to make reasonable and modest profits.  A smaller sum such as €2 billion would stimulate much activity.  The money should be lent to the agriculture and commercial sector but not for property.  We got badly burned with property.  I know people from my class at school who are my age who were led astray.  They did not have expertise but they were doing well and had a good job.  Not only do they have one house but they have 20.  It is a pity because a small bit of greed was involved.  One has to put one's hand on one's heart and ask what they need them for.  I have eight children, thank God, and we have only one house.  We could not afford to buy a second house and we did not want one anyway.  My daughter has built a house now and my son is in the process of buying a house.  That is the way it always was.  We did our best to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Anyone with experience of business is aware that we all get knocks.  Anyone who is in business for 30 years knows that we have had a number of recessions and we came out of them but this one is severe because of the bad banks.  There is no point in codding ourselves in this House, year in and year out.  We just have to deal with the issue and not have the bondholders laughing at us.  They are laughing all the way to the bank because they are not affected.  I am afraid that there could be trouble on the streets because people cannot take it, will not take it and should not be asked to take it.  We should change our ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Deputies on all sides hear about what is happening.  Deputy Mathews knows about banks.  I had discussions with him about what we can do and what the ICC Bank did.  The Minister of State is aware of that as well.  We could do that again.  The policy of the two pillar banks is flawed.  They have had long enough since we voted on that night in September in 2008 but we have not seen any return for our vote.  If I had a chance again I would vote the opposite way.  Time is a great educator.  It is easy to be wise after the event.  The pillar banks are not fit for purpose.  They are not doing the work they are supposed to do.  I welcome the inclusion of the review process in the Bill and the guidelines on the type of lending, which I hope is confined to agriculture, small industry and commercial business.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I got a taxi this morning to the House from TV3.  It was a 2004 vehicle and the driver was 25 years in the business.  His vehicle is at the end of its life but it is going perfectly.  Vehicles have to undergo all kinds of tests nowadays - rightly so.  The taxi driver no longer has enthusiasm for the business.  He is afraid.  He has to work six and a half days a week and longer days to try to make ends meet.  He does not know whether he can replace his car.  He knows that if he goes to the bank for a loan he will probably be told at the front door or the counter not even to come in.  That is what the banks are doing.  In my county at the moment the banks are advertising on radio and in the newspapers that they are open for business.  I hope they are.  However, I will believe it when I see it and when I meet the people after mass, at social events or matches.  There is no place we can hide from them, unless we want to hide.  We cannot hide from them because there are so many people who cannot obtain finances.  I refer to people of good standing who are not fly-by-nights.  They were never people who did not repay what they owed, but now they are stifled.  What is worse is that in recent years they have used up their pension reserves.  Some of them are in their 60s now and they are really at the end of the road.  This time next year they will not have any recourse.  The footfall is not there and people are not spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I do not agree with much of what those on the left advocate.  I could call them comrades.  I suppose they would like to call me comrade.  However, I can see that austerity is dragging people down.  It is dragging us all down.  It is too much.  We cannot have austerity without stimulus.  I hope the Taoiseach will inform us when he comes back from Brussels next week that he asked Mrs. Merkel whether she wants the same thing to happen in Ireland as happened in Greece, France and other countries.  I refer to contagion among the electorate.  People are sick of austerity and cannot cope with it.  It is being said that people who want to vote "Yes" in the referendum on the treaty do not have the heart to go to the polling station.  They voted "Yes" so many times and they voted Governments in and out but they do not have the heart or the energy anymore.  They have just thrown in the towel.  I am confident the Minister of State will take those views back to Government.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_598">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, for introducing the Credit Guarantee Bill.  Deputy Perry knows at first hand the lack of credit that exists for small and medium enterprises.  The Government is determined to address the issue, to allow businesses to expand, to operate on a day-to-day basis and to face the difficult economic challenges that exist, as well as to protect and create jobs in the process.  The Bill is important because it provides for the much-needed introduction of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  The scheme will ensure there will be an adequate flow of credit in the economy to support economic recovery.  Even though the banking industry has been recapitalised and restructured there is an issue with small business, in particular specialist businesses, that are not getting an adequate supply of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We are aware that 96% of the goals have been achieved in the Government's action plan for jobs.  That reinforces the Government's determination to encourage job creation and job retention and to help rebuild the economy.  The temporary partial credit guarantee scheme will provide vital support and assistance to businesses in my constituency in Dublin North-East which are finding it very difficult to secure credit from banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">SMEs are the backbone of the economy.  It is vital that they are allowed to survive through this difficult economic climate.  They are significant employers.  SMEs throughout the country are struggling.  The scheme will provide a lifeline to businesses which operate in sectors where banks are not particularly friendly, do not have experience and are not currently providing credit.  The scheme will provide a Government guarantee for lender banks in the order of 75% on eligible individual loans to viable companies.  The guarantee will only be paid where an SME defaults and will apply to the unrecovered outstanding balance.  A crucial component of the scheme is its focus on viable businesses.  None of us wants a situation where scarce resources are applied to enterprises which have little chance of survival in the long term.  There was too much of that in the past.  An annual premium of 2% on outstanding loan balances will be paid to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The State will enter into an agreement with the lender and a guarantee will be given to the latter based on its portfolio of loans rather than on a loan-by-loan basis.  I welcome the appointment of Capita Asset Services, a subsidiary of Capita PLC, to manage the operation of the scheme.  The 800 businesses expected to benefit immediately from the rolling out of this initiative will be in a position to contribute to the recovery of the domestic economy by paying taxes and providing jobs for people currently claiming social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The problem of lack of credit for business was raised by almost every speaker.  This time last year I was approached by a businessman who was seeking to set up a pizza business in my constituency.  This individual had encountered difficulties with every bank he had approached, before one of them finally offered him a partial loan.  Fortunately, he was able to proceed on that basis and the business finally got up and running some months ago.  He would be much further down the road if this scheme had been available previously.  By facilitating the provision of credit that is vital to every small business, it will have a positive effect on the sector and improve the competitiveness of Irish SMEs.  Ireland is one of only a small number of European Union countries that do not have a credit guarantee scheme in place.  By introducing these provisions the Government is ensuring Irish businesses can compete with their counterparts elsewhere on the Continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">This is a constructive and welcome initiative for the SME sector.  It has been widely welcomed, including by Chambers Ireland and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, as the beginning of a process of investment that will lead to job creation and retention.  Its introduction was signalled by previous Administrations and the Government is now delivering on that undertaking.  It will offer comfort to business people and help viable small businesses to get trading, employ people and contribute to the economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickNulty" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward this very positive legislation which represents a small step forward in our collective endeavours to restore economic growth and create jobs.  On 3 May I submitted a parliamentary question on the progress of the Bill and I am very pleased to see it finally being brought forward.  Ensuring small businesses can thrive in a small open economy such as ours is crucial to our economic welfare.  There are some 200,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the State which between them employ approximately 650,000 people.  With more than 400,000 on the live register, the important role played by the small business sector in the economy is clear to see.  Foreign direct investment is vital to our long-term economic prospects, but promoting ingenuity and creativity within the indigenous SME sector is of equal importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The maximum of €150 million to be allocated annually under the credit guarantee scheme represents a moderate but concrete step in our efforts to support the small business sector.  However, given that it includes no element of compulsion, the question must arise as to whether it will be sufficient to encourage our dysfunctional banking system to recommence normal lending.  The data for 2011 which allow for a comparison between credit facilities withdrawn as against new lending sanctioned show that support from the banking system to the small business sector contracted by some €800 million in that year.  There is a major problem with the banking system, as Deputy Peter Mathews and others eloquently outlined.  As such, the credit guarantee scheme is merely a small part of what is required to drive the economy forward and encourage growth and job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the bank guarantee scheme introduced in 2008.  I was not a Member of the House at that time, but it is clear in my mind that this was the most disastrous decision ever made by an Irish Government and the Oireachtas.  It has decimated the economy.  I am 29 years old and I see thousands of my generation facing negative equity and mass emigration.  The bank guarantee is a crucial factor in the situation in which we find ourselves.  I hope that in time those who voted for it will acknowledge that they were mistaken.  My own party stood alone in opposing it and was absolutely correct in doing so.  The State now controls Allied Irish Banks and has a majority stake in Bank of Ireland.  As such, it must flex its muscles in an effort to ensure they return to normal banking practices.  That is not, of course, to say they should return to the rampant financial speculation of the middle years of the last decade but rather that they resume their function of lending to people with viable business proposals that will lead to the creation of jobs.  I hope the credit guarantee scheme will encourage them to do so.  The State has pumped some €64 billion into the banks and ordinary people face the consequences of the bailout every day of their lives.  It is about time the banking sector showed some semblance of interest in the future economic well-being of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Before the election the Labour Party called for the establishment of a strategic investment bank and such an undertaking was included in the programme for Government.  Will the Minister of State indicate when there will be progress in this regard?  It is the type of economic stimulus the country needs, given that the existing pillar banks are not functioning.  There is nothing new in the concept of strategic or sovereign investment which is commonplace in other countries.  In France, for example, a strategic investment fund was established in 2008 in order to enhance the supply of equity to the business sector.  It was endowed with an allocation of €20 billion, with the French Government, with a 49% stake, and a state-owned bank, with a 51% stake, each contributing €7 billion and the remaining €6 billion being raised by other means.  For example, Renault-Nissan, which produces electric car batteries, is investing in information technology companies and electrical companies.  The aim of the FSI was to stop the asset-stripping and buying out of French companies at discount prices by foreign companies - vulture investments, if you like.  It also plays a role in supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I am glad to be able to say in the House that Nicolas Sarkozy is the former French President.  He did untold damage to the entire Continent through his approach to austerity and by driving vicious spending cuts and tax increases for people on very low and moderate incomes.  This has had a disastrous impact, and I hope history judges him with the contempt in which I hold him and his right-wing politics.  Even Mr. Sarkozy acknowledged, on 20 November 2008, that an austerity plan does nothing except depress further an economy that is already depressed.  If this acknowledgment by the very architect of austerity is not a damning indictment, I do not know what is.  In this country we have had swingeing spending cuts of about €12 billion.  In an economy such as Ireland's, austerity is like quicksand: the harder we push, the further we sink.  It is quite simply not working.  All Deputies who speak to small business owners, people who are struggling on social welfare payments or PAYE workers who are struggling to get by must know that instinctively.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">In Britain, for example, a strategic investment fund of €750 million was established in April 2009 by the Labour Party.  It invested in UK emerging industries including low-carbon vehicles, wind and wave power and renewable chemicals.  It provided seed capital for the roll-out of swift broadband to almost every home and business, and for high-tech companies and advanced manufacturing, including printable electronics, industrial biotechnology and low-carbon aircraft engine technology.  It was a limited fund which was essentially designed to assist and speed along new developments and innovations in technology.  It is clear that such funds can play a major role.  That investment fund, which was established by our sister party, the Labour Party in Britain, played a major role in supporting new and environmentally friendly technologies.  It was, if you like, a green stimulus plan.  There is much potential for a similar fund in Ireland.  For example, my Labour Party colleague Senator John Kelly has introduced a Bill dealing with wind energy, which I welcome.  That is the type of innovative proposal this country needs if we are to recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome and support the Bill, but if we continue to strangle domestic demand in our economy, it is small business that will be hit hardest.  Such businesses will have to lay off or reduce the hours of their workers.  That is a damning indictment of the politics and policies of austerity, which do not work.  I have heard this time and again in public debate, but I do not think it can be said enough.  What everyone in this House wants is to create jobs and build a society in which everyone has equality and in which wealth is redistributed from those who have significant amounts of private wealth and shared with people who are struggling.  I am sure Deputies see in their advice clinics week after week people who cannot pay their rent at the end of the month, who cannot heat their homes or who cannot give their kids a packed lunch for school.  This is a reality for tens of thousands of people the length and breadth of the country.  Some of them are self-employed.  Some may have a car in the drive, but they cannot afford to put petrol in it.  We must be cognisant of what is happening in the real economy.  In fairness, this Bill recognises that in its own moderate way.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">I agree with comments made recently, on May Day, by the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Bernadette Ségol, who said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_611">Making jobs insecure, and especially jobs for young people, is not a solution to the crisis.  Flexible employment contracts and low salaries do not pave the way to growth.  The ETUC recommends an economic recovery plan that supports quality employment.  In the face of populism, it is vital to build a Europe of solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">This is important for small businesses that are under pressure to ensure they do not succumb to the drive to lower the wages and conditions of their own employees.  Ultimately, if a company is making products or selling goods or services, it simply will not thrive if there is no one there to purchase them.  It is absolutely critical that we institute a change in how we deal with the economic crisis.  Unfortunately, that has not happened to date, although there have been some welcome steps forward, including this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Other contributors touched on the broader economic context, and so will I, if I may.  In the 1980s, we had a significant revisionist phase which played a role in reassessing the history and future of our island.  I fear that at the moment we are encountering a revisionist phase with regard to the economic crisis.  We are being told that Ireland's economic problems are a consequence of public spending gone wild and lavish expenditure on health, education and social welfare.  That is absolute nonsense which bears no resemblance to the facts.  In 2010, Government revenue was 34% of GDP.  The only countries with a lower proportion were Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania and Slovakia.  Certainly, it was not investment in health, education and transport that created our economic crisis.  Incidentally, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimates that by 2015, Ireland will be bottom of the league in terms of investment and public expenditure.  I hope that in his earlier contribution Deputy McGrath was not being flippant about ethics in public office.  The cause of our economic crisis was threefold.  First, we had a completely deregulated banking system which invested irresponsibly and was purely driven by greed and corruption.  The second reason was a planning system in which county councillors, particularly those from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael although I do not include all councillors of those parties, participated in massive rezoning of land.  My area of Dublin West saw land rezoned day in and day out, purely to inflate its price.  We debated the Mahon report recently in the House.  The third reason for our economic crisis was right-wing, Fianna Fáil economics which resulted in the provision of tax breaks to very wealthy developers for projects such as hotels, when that money should have been used to invest in social infrastructure such as child care and education facilities, or in our health service.  If that money had been used correctly, we would now have a much firmer base on which to make adjustments.  I accept that adjustments must be made and that we must meet our international obligations, but the way in which we do that is a political choice.  We need to choose options that will create growth and stimulate our economy.  If we listen to economists from the Nevin Economic Research Institute and TASC, we will find that the balance between the types of taxation and the spending cuts we are implementing, as against what we should be doing such as closing off property-based tax loopholes, is wrong.  I hope we will move towards an evidence-based approach to economic recovery.  As far as I understand it, the EU-IMF troika has always been crystal clear that budgetary policy and the balance between tax and spending are matters for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It is clear that as a country we have choices.  The credit guarantee scheme does provide some options for us in terms of supporting small businesses, but how can we compel the banks to lend?</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Commercial rates are crippling small businesses and many are struggling to pay them.  In addressing the problem of upward-only rent reviews we would have dealt with this issue.  The Government considered it very closely.  It was given advice that addressing upward-only rent reviews was not possible in the current constitutional and legal framework.  Surely there will be an opportunity at the constitutional convention the Government has established to determine whether a referendum or other mechanism is necessary to tackle the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  In my constituency of Dublin West retailers in the Blanchardstown Centre tell me every day that a review of the issue would have a significant impact on them, their workers' job security and, most important, the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">If the country is to recover, it is critical that we examine the relationship between the economy, the dysfunctional banking system and generating jobs and growth.  In that context, the Government must return to the promissory notes issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_620">In recent days reference was made to retired staff who had held senior positions in the HSE being rehired on short-term contracts because of their expertise or specialist skills.  Many have rightly aired their annoyance and anger at this practice.  One can understand staff being utilised in the circumstances for a short period.  Their hiring is necessitated because the incentivised retirement scheme led to large numbers of experienced personnel retiring.  Their expertise is now sorely missed.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">The issue I am raising concerns the number of personnel who retired from their employment with the HSE in the Dublin mid-Leinster area as far back as February.  Psychiatric nurses who, in some cases, served in an exemplary fashion for up to 40 years have not, as of today, received what they are rightfully due and expected to receive without any glitch, namely, their pensions and gratuities.  They have been left high and dry.  It beggars belief that these circumstances have been allowed to prevail, despite the fact that more than three months have elapsed.  It certainly reflects poorly on HSE management.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Most people know my views on the HSE at this stage.  The kernel of the problem is that the Department's section that deals with pension entitlements and gratuities did not have the necessary staff complement to enable it to carry out the assessments and compute each individual's entitlements.  I know from some contacts that there are no additional staff allocated for this task.  Surely, since the retirement scheme was flagged well in advance, HSE senior management should have been able to make a good educated guess as to the likely number of retirees.  Accordingly, they should have realised a significant number of personnel were required to ensure the entitlements retirees were due could be calculated, assessed and awarded within three or four weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">I acknowledge that the staff involved are working to the best and limit of their abilities to deal with the great workload.  The computation of gratuities and pensions is complex and requires specialists.  It is unfair to have allowed the staff in question to carry such a huge load.  The way this issue has been handled by HSE senior management has been extremely poor, to say the least, and less than inspiring.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">I ask that this matter be addressed by the HSE deploying immediately a significant number of personnel to its pensions section in the Dublin mid-Leinster area so as to have the pensions and gratuities paid to the retired staff in question.  On what does it expect them to live?  Does it expect them to live on fresh air?  I have been disgusted by the high-handed treatment they have received.  There has been little or no communication or return of their telephone calls, and no response to myself, and I wrote letters on their behalf.  This seems to be a trend with the HSE.  It does not respond to mere minions like me who are elected by such people to advocate on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Let us end this debacle, after more than three months, for these people who have given excellent public service.  These people, who have given public service of the highest standard, should not have to wait any longer for their entitlements.  I expect a positive reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health  (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_626">If we could only meet everyone's expectations.  I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and I thank Deputy Penrose for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The so-called pensions grace period was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.  It provided that the reduction in public service pay, which had effect from the same date, would be disregarded for the purpose of calculating retirement benefits for staff who retired by 29 February 2012.  During the period from September 2011 to February 2012, 4,700 staff retired from the public health service.  Of this figure, 970 were staff who were not in current service, such as persons availing of preserved benefits or who had been absent on long-term sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The concentration of retirements in the final months of the grace period necessitated the calculation and payment of benefits at a rate well above normal levels.  To deal with this increase in demand in the context of reducing staff numbers, where possible, pensions unit staff worked additional hours on an overtime basis.  Every effort is being made to ensure benefits are calculated and paid within a reasonable timeframe.  It is important to note that, in general, there is a time lag of four to six weeks between retirement date and the payment of pension.  Within this period a retiree would generally receive a final salary payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In recent months, with the concentrated volume of retirements, the general processing period has had to be extended to six to eight weeks.  To date, the retirement benefits of more than 90% of staff who retired from the public health sector before the end of the grace period have been fully paid out.  The processing of benefits in some cases can be complex owing to the variety of contractual arrangements, work patterns and different payment patterns which may have applied throughout the career of the health service employee.  Where delays have been experienced or where a retired staff member has requested to be paid some moneys, the HSE has made interim part-payments.  This is to minimise financial hardship.  This part-payment is made while the retired employee's full career service and pensionable earnings are being verified.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">I am aware that recently there have been some resourcing issues in the pensions service in the HSE midlands region.  To address this, a pension manager has been assigned, along with three additional staff, to deal with outstanding cases.  As a result, good progress has been made and the HSE anticipates the great majority of these cases will have been processed by the end of this month.  A small number of more complex cases, which I am sure is what the Deputy is talking about, will take somewhat longer to process, but it is anticipated these will be completed during June.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_631">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for the complex reply.  Two of those with whom I am involved have spent almost 40 years in St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar.  They have been working in one area and there is no complexity.  I have one who retired some months ago due to ill health and has not received anything.  This lady is in a difficult financial position and had to retire on health grounds.  We owe it to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">I was here when the Prompt Payment of Accounts Bill 1997 was enacted under which State bodies got 30 days grace to pay or otherwise there would be penalties.  The State is dilatory and negligent.  The HSE should have known.  Of course, they knew who would retire.  If a person had 38 or 39 years' service, anybody would know he or she would retire.  All they had to do was check the records.  This is not good enough.  I will not settle for this type of thing ever happening again.  It is something the Minister of State would address.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">I compliment the staff who are trying to work to the nth degree and the best of their ability to deal with the matter.  Not enough staff were allocated to this task in the Dublin and mid-Leinster region.  It is only in recent days they started to get their wheel out after receiving letters.  I sent my letter the other day to Mr. Magee, the chief executive officer of the HSE.  This should have been well flagged.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">If this ever happens again, the outstanding payments should be levied against the State body involved.  At the end of the day, suppliers are entitled to get interest if the State does not honour its 30 day commitment, and individuals who have given significant service to the State in their work should likewise be remunerated.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_635">Like Deputy Penrose, I would hope we never again find ourselves in a position where we must introduce a scheme such as this, even though, under the agreement with those who are paying for the ongoing funding of the country, we have agreed we must reduce further.  The manner in which this scheme was introduced did no one any favours.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">There are approximately 370 remaining grace period retirements still to be paid.  Whereas I take on board what Deputy Penrose said about someone who retired as a result of ill health, if an application were made to the HSE, there would be part-payment forthcoming.  No one should be left destitute as a result of retiring under a scheme which the Government introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">There were staff who, up until two weeks before the deadline, had not notified the Department of Health or anyone else that they were about to retire.  In some instances, it was not the case that staff had sent in notice well in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">Despite the fact a person may have worked in one institution all of his or her working life, there are issues such as overtime and maternity leave that must be calculated.  The last thing we want is that someone does not get the full pension to which he or she would be entitled.</p>

          <speech by="#PatrickDeering" eId="spk_346">
            <from>Deputy Pat Deering</from>
            <p eId="para_639">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting this issue which is of grave importance to the people of Carlow, especially since an issue arose in the recent past which has created much media attention, both nationally and locally.  The issue concerns a lack of common sense in the management of the ambulance service in the area.  I point out that there is no issue with the level of care and attention the particular individual in question received in the past week.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">The incident arose during a Leinster minor football championship match in Dr. Cullen Park in Carlow on Wednesday of last night week when, unfortunately, a 17 year old player broke his leg just before half-time.  I bring to the attention of the House the farcical comedy of errors that arose as a result.  The player in question broke his leg and a call was placed to the ambulance service at 8.05 p.m.  Because there are only two ambulances available in Carlow, both of which were out on duty at the time, an ambulance had to be dispatched from Portlaoise.  It arrived in Carlow at 8.47 p.m.  The player was attended to in Dr. Cullen Park in Carlow by the doctor on duty and it was obvious his leg was broken badly.  He was cared for by the doctor while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">The player arrived in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny at approximately 9.55 p.m.  He was assessed and an ambulance was requested to bring him to Waterford, which is the main centre of excellence in the particular area.  An ambulance had to be dispatched from Dublin to bring him to Waterford.  On its way from Dublin, an emergency arose in Naas and the ambulance was diverted to Naas.  As I pointed out, there is no issue with the care and attention the player was getting.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Another ambulance was requested from Carlow, which was the original place of the incident.  The ambulance arrived from Carlow to Kilkenny at 1.43 a.m. to bring the player to Waterford Regional Hospital.  The player arrived in Waterford Regional Hospital at 3.20 a.m. and was looked after, and was got to bed at 4 a.m., which was eight hours after the original incident took place.  It was a comedy of errors.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">It was obvious that the player's leg was badly broken.  I accept there was no threat to his life.  However, when the doctor on duty diagnosed the break, the player should have been transferred directly to Waterford Regional Hospital rather than to St. Luke's in Kilkenny.  It did not seem to make sense to oblige him to wait in St. Luke's for six hours before transporting him to Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">We are seeking a common-sense approach to this matter, which has given rise to concern both locally and nationally.  I am interested in ensuring there will be no recurrence of these events.  I accept that if there had been a life-threatening condition involved and if there had been a wait of six hours, then matters would be much more serious.  Fortunately, in this instance the player had broken his leg but it was not a life-threatening injury.  Common sense must prevail in respect of the management of the ambulance service in the area.  If a doctor is on duty and if he or she diagnoses the extent and nature of an injury, then he or she should be in a position to decide the hospital to which the patient should be brought.  In this instance, Waterford Regional Hospital, the main centre of excellence for orthopaedics in the area, should have been the destination to which the patient was transported.  I ask that the position in this regard be reassessed in order that common sense will prevail in future.</p>

          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_347" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_645">I thank the Deputy for raising this topical issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  When an emergency ambulance is requested, the nearest available ambulance crewed by paramedic or advanced paramedic staff is dispatched by the control and command centre.  On arrival at the incident, the ambulance crew assesses and stabilises the patient and provides ongoing treatment, as required, during transport to an emergency department.  Clinical protocols require patients to be transported to the nearest accident and emergency department.  Accordingly, patients in the catchment area of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, are brought to the accident and emergency department at that facility, where their condition can be appropriately assessed and clinical decisions made on further treatment.  Where, following assessment by an accident and emergency department consultant, a decision is made to transfer a patient to another hospital for treatment, this transfer is carried out by intermediate care transport, where available, or by emergency ambulance.  Where an emergency ambulance is to be used for the inter-hospital transfer of a stabilised patient, as with 999 calls, priority is always given to emergencies involving injuries or conditions that are life-threatening in nature.  Consideration is also given to maintaining a level of emergency ambulance cover in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The national ambulance service works closely with both local GP services and out-of-hours family doctor services in all areas.  While some level of emergency care and assessment may be possible at this level at the scene of an incident, most often full assessments, including a range of diagnostic tests, take place in the emergency department.  This is the position where an X-ray is required, particularly as an assessment in respect of to treatment cannot be carried out prior to the X-ray.  On occasion, where a specific specialty is known to be required, a clinical decision may be made to go directly to another hospital where that specialty is available.  Such a decision may be based on factors such as an on-scene assessment of the patient's condition or his or her known medical history.  Where an X-ray is required, this is not possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">In the recent case to which the Deputy refers, a local GP was present at the incident and was liaising with the ambulance service until the nearest emergency ambulance with an advanced paramedic on board arrived.  The patient received treatment at the scene from the ambulance crew, including analgesia, and was transferred to Kilkenny accident and emergency.  Following further assessment and diagnosis, a clinical decision was made to transfer the stabilised patient to Waterford.  The transfer was made and the patient received appropriate treatment in respect of his injury.  Our pre-hospital emergency care standards for paramedics and for the ambulance service are at the forefront of best practice.  I am satisfied that, in this instance, appropriate clinical protocols were followed and that the clinical decisions made were in the best interests of the patient.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatrickDeering" eId="spk_348">
            <from>Deputy Pat Deering</from>
            <p eId="para_648">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I reiterate that the level of care provided in this particular case is not in question.  The patient involved received very good care.  However, it did not make sense that the doctor on duty, who is a specialist in this area and who regularly attends GAA matches and other sporting events, could not decide on which hospital to send the player who had sustained a bad leg break.  It was obvious that the best place to transport the player was the nearest orthopaedic centre of excellence.  That centre of excellence is, of course, located in Waterford.  As a result of what happened in the Celtic tiger era, there are good roads in the area and the journey from Carlow to Waterford, which used to take 90 minutes, now takes less than an hour.  Rather than obliging the patient involved to spend six hours sitting in the accident and emergency department in Kilkenny following his X-ray, it would have made more sense to transport him directly to Waterford to have everything done in one go.  He would, by 3 a.m., have been well on the way to recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">There is a need to ensure the management of the ambulance service in the area is more streamlined in nature.  This will ensure that people will not be obliged to wait for long periods to be treated and that we can get the best use of the service available.  I reiterate that there is no doubt that the patient in this instance received the best care possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_650">In all situations, local knowledge is clearly invaluable.  In this instance there was a GP present and this individual was in constant contact with the ambulance service.  We must, therefore, assume that the decisions made were in the best interests of the person who required treatment.  I have taken on board what the Deputy has said and I will ensure the Minister for Health is made aware of his concerns.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_651">I welcome the Minister.  Today is the 38th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I want to extend my continuing sympathy to and express my solidarity with all the survivors and the bereaved of that terrible day.  Some 33 people were killed in those bombings, which were carried out by agents acting in collusion with British Crown forces.  Of that there is now no doubt.  However, what we do not have is accountability and truth and justice from the British Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">During his presentation to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on 2 February last, Members from both Houses pressed British Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, MP, on the failure of the British Government to disclose relevant documentation.  Mr. Paterson told the committee that the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, William Hague, MP, had indicated that "He assured his counterpart here that we have made available the synopsis that is relevant to this case."  This apparently refers to a ten-page letter to Judge Barron from former Secretary of State, John Reid, dated 26 February 2002.  Judge Barron expressed his frustration regarding the lack of information contained in this letter.  He repeatedly requested the British Government for access to the documents themselves but on every occasion he was refused.  With a straight face, Owen Paterson, MP, told the committee that the British Government has been "completely straight and up-front".  He also stated, "At every opportunity we have made information available".  The Irish Government cannot let this go unchallenged.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">On 9 February last, the Seanad agreed unanimously a motion which notes that the question of obtaining access to information held by the British Government has been pursued for many years and requests the Irish Government "to continue to raise the matter with the British Government and to press it to comply with this request and reaffirms the support of Members on all sides of this House".  This mirrors a similar resolution adopted by the Dáil on my party's proposal at this time last year.  Clearly, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have a strong mandate from the Oireachtas - this has been repeatedly stated and was the subject of a motion passed unanimously by the House a few short years ago - to pursue this issue with real determination with the British Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">On 18 April last, <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper in Britain reported that an official review has concluded that thousands of documents detailing some of the most shameful acts and crimes committed during the final years of the British Empire were systematically destroyed to prevent them falling into the hands of post-independence governments.  Those papers that survived were flown to Britain, where they were hidden for 50 years in a secret Foreign Office archive, beyond the reach of historians and members of the public and in breach of legal obligations for them to be transferred into the public domain.  These files related to crimes by British forces in Kenya and other countries.  The Government here should certainly ask the British Government if files relating to the conflict in Ireland, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other acts of collusion, in particular, were similarly treated.  Were some files destroyed and others retained secretly and, perhaps, illegally?  We need answers to our questions in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The final issue to which I wish to refer is that relating to funding for Justice for the Forgotten.  This organisation has been the sole representative voice for victims of the conflict in this State for many years.  The previous Government ended funding for the group which has done significant work both to support the survivors and the bereaved and to advance the search for truth and justice.  In December 2010, Justice for the Forgotten, while retaining its own name and identity, merged with the Pat Finucane Centre and secured a limited stream of funding.  However, that did not cover the Dublin office which is now regrettably closed.  The entire office has been vacated and its work and files transferred only the other day to a portakabin at the home of the principal voice and anchor of the group's great work.  This is simply intolerable and I urge the Government to restore funding for Justice for the Forgotten to allow it resume its efficient and effective work which is much appreciated by the survivors and the bereaved of those terrible acts of 17 May 1974.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this issue in the House today, the anniversary of the savage and barbaric bombings in Dublin and Monaghan and the tragic loss of life and injuries that resulted.  Thirty-eight years ago, three bombs exploded around Dublin, including not far from here, in the busy evening rush hour.  Then, about 90 minutes later, another bomb exploded outside Greacen's Pub in Monaghan town.  Thirty-three people were killed and more than 100 people suffered injuries in these four bombs.  The families of those killed and injured have borne the grief of those tragic events.  Although the passage of time may have eased their pain to some small degree, their suffering has not gone away and the memory of their loved ones lives on with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">The late Judge Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking inquiry into those awful events of May 1974 and other tragic atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which many other innocent people lost their lives.  The Barron report provided some of the answers the families concerned had sought about the bombings and the subsequent hearings of the Oireachtas joint committee provided the families with an important opportunity to have their voices heard and to tell their stories.  All the families still have unanswered questions about what happened to their loved ones, about why it happened and how it happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">This House and Seanad Éireann have previously and unanimously urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.  I know that many Deputies in this House have raised this issue with our Westminster counterparts and that they will continue to do so.  For its part, since this Government took office, the Taoiseach has raised the issue with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the Tánaiste has also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">Dealing with the legacy of the past is not an easy task.  There is no simple formula of words or actions that can put things right.  The Government is strongly committed to working in partnership with the British Government and with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive to find ways to address the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  There is no ready resolution to the complexity of addressing the past.  It is, however, a challenge that the two Governments and the executive are determined and willing to undertake.  That said, it is also a challenge that all who were party to the conflict must also be willing to take up.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">As we progress to a better future for all who share this island and those who live on the neighbouring island, we must not forget those who died, those who were injured and those who mourn them.  The Good Friday Agreement recognised the special position of victims.  In remembering the victims and their families, we should be strengthened in our determination to construct a changed society in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">This House is unanimous in its message to our British counterparts.  I hope we can also send a message of solidarity to the families of those who were so tragically killed in Dublin and Monaghan and, indeed, to the families of all those who lost their lives in the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the closure of the Dublin office of the Justice for the Forgotten and the issue arising with regard to the storage of its documents.  Unfortunately, in current financial circumstances I cannot create funding that is not available.  I regret I am not in a position to address the funding issue.  I would be happy to ask departmental officials to liaise with the group to see to what extent, if any, we could be of assistance in document storage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_663">Not for the first time, I want to reaffirm my and my party's absolute commitment to addressing the tragic occurrences of the past years and the consequences of the conflict.  The critical issue here is the willingness of one of the key protagonists, the British Government, to so do also.  There has been a record of failure on its part with minimalist responses to a series of requests by eminent people appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to carry out inquiries into the matters in question.  It is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">As I said in my opening remarks, there is evidence the British Government has secretly retained vast stores of documents regarding its former imperial presence on the part of past British Governments.  The Kenyan situation is one of particular note.  It is most likely, given the vast store of documents on the Kenyan situation, that the events of 38 years ago here in this city and my home town of Monaghan have a similar store of documentation and evidence regarding those responsible for carrying out of these atrocities and the <i>raison d’être</i> for their proposition and carrying out.  I believe that information is indeed in the hands of the British Government and its surrogate forces in Britain and the North of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">It is imperative for the sake of truth and justice that they fully comply with the unanimous appeal of this House, one which I and the Minister supported.  I urge the Government to readdress this issue with its British counterparts to see the establishment of a full, independent, cross-jurisdictional inquiry.  Even in these straitened economic times, I also appeal for a limited restoration of the essential funding to allow Justice for the Forgotten to continue its important work, work it would only be delighted to conclude but only in the context of finality and closure for all of the survivors and bereaved.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">In July 2008, the Dáil unanimously adopted a motion urging the British Government to allow access to original documents held by it relating to the atrocities inquired into by Judge Barron.  It directed the Clerk of the Dáil to request the matter be considered by the House of Commons.  Seanad Éireann passed a unanimous motion in similar terms in February 2012.  The Dáil restated its position on this matter when it adopted a unanimous position in a Private Members' motion in May 2011.  Representatives of the previous and current Government have raised this matter with the British Government so far, unfortunately, without success.  The Tánaiste has previously raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who has indicated the British Government was not in a position to accede to the request.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, as recently as their meeting during St. Patrick's week earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">Today's exchange has provided an opportunity to reaffirm the united position which the House adopted with regard to this important issue.  It is essential we continue to maintain that united front and I assure the Deputy the Government will continue to raise this issue at every opportunity with the British Government and its members.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_669">I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue.  The Minister is well aware of the considerable publicity on the security issues that have arisen at Dublin Airport and within the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  It is my understanding the DAA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have, for the past six weeks, been aware of concerns about an audit of security procedures at the airport.  For that reason, we are deeply concerned the Department did not move more quickly to address this issue.  The Minister is also aware of the concerns of the people who fly through the airport and, more particularly, the impact this has on business people who must transfer through other airports, particularly Heathrow.  It is the case that many people who must necessarily travel through Heathrow must now be screened again there, which will delay access to other locations and airports.  It also has a negative impact on Ireland as a place to do business and as a tourist destination.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">I ask that the Minister clarify the following issues.  When did the Department become aware of the issue concerning the audit of goods sold within the airport environment?  Are there any implications for the other two major State airports in Shannon and Cork?  Nobody is suggesting there is an immediate crisis or that anything particularly nefarious has taken place but, unfortunately, there is an inability to provide the appropriate recognition of where goods sold in the airport environment emanate, the traceability of same or to stand over the fact that the goods have not been tampered with or could be used in some kind of criminal plot.  That raises serious concerns in the minds of the travelling public, and as a result, Ireland has been presented as less than whole in its security arrangements in the airport environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">This is damaging and the issue should not have arisen.  My understanding is this audit by the European Commission was not unscheduled and the Department and DAA were well aware of the procedures in place and that the check would be done.  It is disappointing that when it is known a State agency is not conforming to regulations, nothing is done when an audit is allowed to take place.  My understanding is that it will take two months to put in place appropriate procedures to allow passengers to transit other airports without having to go through screening or security checks again.  If that is so, it is outrageous that remedial action did not take place when the Department and the DAA first became aware of the problem.  Will the Minister clarify the issue and the question of why it took so long - or the process of an audit - to spur the Department and the DAA to action?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_674">In fairness, the Acting Chairman could have provided at least an extra minute to cope with the obvious sprints he had to make down the corridor to get here in good time.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">This is a serious issue and I thank the Deputy for raising it.  In light of recent comment about the outcome of the European Commission's inspection of Dublin Airport, I state at the outset that Dublin Airport is safe for passengers, aircraft and all users of the airport.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for aviation security policy and for ensuring compliance by airports, airlines and other relevant entities with national and international aviation security requirements.  This function is carried out by the Department through the implementation of a comprehensive quality control programme, including audits, inspections and tests at Irish State and regional airports, with the aim of ensuring security at Irish airports meets EU and international requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">The implementation of security measures at individual airports within the State is, for operational reasons, a matter for the individual airport operator concerned and for all entities operating within the airport environment.  In addition to the comprehensive compliance monitoring regime implemented by the Department at Dublin Airport and all other airports in the State, there is a high level of interaction between the Department and the DAA on an ongoing basis on aviation security matters.  The DAA is also represented at the national civil aviation security committee, which is chaired by the Department and meets at a minimum biannually.  Additionally Dublin Airport, as with other airports in the State, has its own airport security committee that meets regularly throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">For security reasons I will not comment on the specifics of security at Dublin Airport or any other airport.  In the course of the Department's compliance monitoring activities, if and when aviation security related issues arise, the Department works closely with the entity concerned - and there are a range of entities involved, including airports, airlines, catering companies, cargo companies, etc. - to rectify these issues as quickly as possible in line with national and European Union legislative requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The recent European Commission inspection of security at Dublin Airport was carried out at the end of March.  The Commission undertakes these audits at all airports in the EU periodically, in line with EU aviation security legislation, to assess compliance with the common aviation security rules.  During the inspection, the Commission found a number of deficiencies and, as a result, other member states may impose some additional security procedures on aircraft arriving from Dublin into their airports.  These additional procedures are not expected to have any impact on passengers at Dublin Airport.  However, passengers departing from Dublin Airport arriving at other EU airports and transferring through those airports <i>en route</i> to their final destination may be required to undergo security screening again at the airport where they are transferring.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">For security reasons I cannot go into the specific details of the issues identified but the Minister and his Department, working in conjunction with the DAA, have taken immediate action to rectify these issues.  In that light, a meeting of the national civil aviation security committee was convened yesterday by the Department to address the matter with relevant parties.  One of the deficiencies identified during the Commission inspection has been addressed, and intensive work is ongoing to address the second issue in as short a timeframe as possible.  To ensure security at the airport is maintained, Dublin Airport is implementing back-up procedures to address the second matter in the short term while a longer-term solution is implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">It is important to state Dublin Airport is safe for passengers, aircraft and all users of the airport.  All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the second remaining issue is addressed as quickly as possible to ensure the airport fully meets all EU aviation security requirements, those additional security procedures imposed on aircraft arriving in other EU airports from Dublin can be lifted as soon as possible, and to ensure sustained compliance with all EU and international aviation security standards in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply, but, unfortunately, the questions I posed in the course of my contribution remain unanswered.  Therefore, I will repeat them.  When the Department and the Dublin Airport Authority were both well aware that the audit of the processing of goods through the airport did not reach the standards set in the directives and expected by other airports, why did the Department not move in advance of the scheduled audit by Commission compliance unit personnel?  What are the implications for Shannon Airport and Cork Airport in the light of the deficiencies found at Dublin Airport?  Must there be a separate inspection of these airports before there must be a change of procedures at either of these locations or they fall foul of the monitoring standards in other airports through which passengers using Shannon and Cork Airports transit?  As the information sought might not be immediately available to the Minister, perhaps he might communicate my request to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I would be happy for it to provide me with the information later.  I appreciate the matter does not fall within the Minister's competency.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">I am not aware of implications arising from these events for either Cork Airport or Shannon Airport; the inspection was of Dublin Airport.  The action taken by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department was to call a meeting to address issues raised, one of which has already been addressed.  I will certainly ask my colleague to furnish the Deputy with any information I am not in a position to provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">1<b>Deputy Dara Calleary</b> asked the <b>Minister for Defence</b> the status of the review into the Reserve Defence Force; the vision he has for the future of the RDF; if he sees it as an integrated part of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [24647/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_360">
            <from>Minister for Defence  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_684">The White Paper on Defence set out the blueprint for a new Reserve Defence Force, while the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, launched in July 2004, provided for the phased development of Reserve Defence Force capabilities in the period to the end of 2009.  There were significant improvements to the quantity and quality of Reserve Defence Force training over the period of the implementation plan.  However, this did not appear to improve retention rates as anticipated and strength continued to decline.  In addition, the development of the integrated element of the Reserve Defence Force did not proceed as intended owing to low participation rates in pilot schemes in 2007 and 2008.  Subsequently, budgetary constraints reduced the availability of paid training for members of the Reserve Defence Force and plans to send members overseas were postponed.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">A value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force was launched in February 2010.  This review is examining the lessons learned from the implementation plan with a view to bringing forward recommendations regarding the future development of the Reserve Defence Force.  As the Deputy is aware, we dealt with this issue at some length yesterday at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">In the period from December 2010 to the end of 2011 other priorities diverted analytical resources away from the value for money review.  These priorities included the preparation of options for making savings arising from the national recovery plan and subsequently, in 2011, undertaking the comprehensive review of expenditure and the associated budgetary process.  Work continued on the value for money review, but at a reduced rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">In practical terms, the development of proposals for the Reserve Defence Force would have been premature in advance of the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure.  The Government revised the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force to 9,500 personnel and in response I initiated a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  This superseded prior recommendations regarding organisation and management of the Reserve Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">My Department's CRE assessment recommended no further cuts to the Reserve pending the outcome of the VFM review. It is worth noting that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's central evaluation unit did not share this assessment.  However, the budget for Reserve training was not reduced further in 2012 and limited recruitment within resource constraints is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">I have asked the steering committee to progress the review as quickly as possible and anticipate its completion by the end of September.  I look forward to receiving the final report.  At this point I do not wish to pre-empt potential findings or recommendations on the future role of the Reserve Defence Force that the steering committee may bring forward.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_691">The postponement of questions meant we discussed this issue in detailed at the committee yesterday, but I will reiterate some of the points made.  The Minister outlined yesterday the sequence of events that had led to the delay in the review of the Reserve Defence Force being completed.  Perhaps the Minister will summarise what he said.  The delay has added considerably to a serious morale problem within the Reserve Defence Force as it does not see any purpose or role for it.  It is a valuable service.  Deputy Stanton and Senator Denis Landy spoke yesterday about their experiences in it and the services it had offered during the years in backing up the civil power and doing emergency work, including flood prevention works, which are hugely significant and important. The review gives us a chance to reiterate and define that role for the Defence Forces in the 21st century.  A definition of the role would stabilise retention rates and numbers could be improved.  I suggested yesterday that in the context of examining the money being spent on the Reserve Defence Force, input costs associated with the Permanent Defence Force were often included and ascribed to the Reserve Defence Force as if they were were specifically its costs.  This is a source of enormous frustration.  The Minister gave some very high figures that I would like to hear again about the costs ascribed to the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  When does he envisage the review process being completed?  Will he bring it before the committee in draft form in order that we can have an input into it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_362" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_692">As the Deputy knows, the future position of the Reserve Defence Force and the manner in which it is organised are caught up in the reorganisation process being undertaken to reduce it from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  That reorganisation must be fed into the review being undertaken of the Reserve Defence Force.  As I said yesterday, I hope the review will be completed by September.  We should have greater clarity surrounding the structure of the Reserve Defence Force and the numbers involved in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">I gave the Deputy some cost figures yesterday and they have not changed in 24 hours.  Similar to other elements of the Defence Forces, the cost of the Reserve Defence Force is spread across a range of subheads of Vote 36.  Subhead A5 is devoted entirely to Reserve Defence Force expenditure and includes payments for training, gratuities and allowances, including grants paid into unit funds.  The 2012 provision is €4.386 million, the same as in 2011, and includes €2.5 million for paid training.  Subheads A3, A4 and A17 include, <i>inter alia,</i> the pay and travel costs of the Permanent Defence Force personnel who provide training and administrative support for the Reserve Defence Force, generally known as the cadre.  Subhead A19 includes rental costs of property used by the Reserve Defence Force.  There is a range of others costs spread across other subheads, including petrol, transport and ration costs.  They are not currently disagregated for the Reserve Defence Force, but the key costs relating to it, if we include the Permanent Defence Force cadre, pay and employer’s PRSI payments, amount to €16,262,000.  Allowances paid to the Permanent Defence Force cadre amount to €2,592,000.  The Deputy will note the figure of almost €19 million within the Permanent Defence Force attributable to the reserve.  It is part of the cost of the reserve because if this work was not undertaken by the individuals who form part of the cadre, they would carry out other operational duties with regard to the Permanent Defence Force.  This is a real and identifiable cost and it is part and parcel of the overall costs.  The total cost of the cadre in all matters relating to the reserve comes to €23,135,000.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_694">What potential future role is there for the reserve?  Several people, including Deputy Stanton, have suggested that we consider the Civil Defence as well and its potential role.  The suggestion is to combine its role with the reserve.  A Civil Defence Bill is due but we are unlikely to see it this session.  Does the Minister have any plans to merge the two operations together in the context of the Bill or the review?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_695">At the moment we are examining the reserve in the context of its functioning, its positioning and its inter-relationship with the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and the back-up it can provide to the PDF.  Naturally, there is a cross-over in the sense that certain duties the reserve undertakes to assist the civil power could equally be undertaken by the Civil Defence, a separate organisation entirely.  The Deputy has raised an interesting point with regard to whether we should consider the role of both organisations to determine whether some amalgamation might be undertaken.  That is not being considered at the moment and I have no wish to cause any undue concern within either organisation or to give rise to any suggestion that decisions of any nature have been made in this regard because they have not.  Certainly, I will bear in mind the suggestion raised by the Deputy.</p>

In answer to a previous question I submitted the Minister stated that all personnel were screened prior to overseas deployment.  The Minister further stated there was a probationary period of between three and four weeks during which personnel received medication before being deployed overseas to establish how they reacted to the medication.  Perhaps the Minister has the answer available now and, if not, perhaps he will pass it on to me.  How many personnel have been in receipt of Lariam?  How many of these were deemed unsuitable after having commenced the taking of Lariam?  How many personnel were ruled out of overseas deployment as a result of being unsuitable because of Lariam?</p>

Any available information with regard to the use of Lariam or, in respect of the individuals concerned, any records that may exist of any contra-indications with regard to their taking of Lariam, will be examined.  The Deputy will be familiar with the fact that a procedure was in place with regard to the giving of Lariam to individuals in the context of checking into their historical medical background and whether they suffered from depression or any other health issue which would have given rise to a contra-indication to the effect that it was not an appropriate drug for them to take.</p>

            <p eId="para_707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  On 21 April 2012, unanimously adopting resolution 2043 (2012), the United Nations Security Council authorised the establishment, for an initial period of 90 days, of a supervision mission, known as the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, UNSMIS.  The purpose of the mission is to monitor a cessation of armed violence "in all its forms by all parties" in Syria.  The new mission is also tasked with monitoring the full implementation of the six-point plan proposed by joint special envoy for the United Nations and the League of Arab States, Mr. Kofi Annan.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">On 24 April 2012, the Government approved the deployment of up to six members of the Permanent Defence Force as unarmed military observers to UNSMIS, in response to a request from the United Nations.  Six Defence Forces personnel were deployed to the mission area on 11 May 2012.  The role of the Irish personnel is to observe and report on the security situation and any transgressions of the ceasefire agreement and the implementation of the six-point plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The UN mission will comprise an initial deployment of up to 300 military observers under the command of a chief military observer with an appropriate civilian component as required by the mission to fulfil its mandate.  It is estimated that all 300 observers will be on the ground by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, mission, acting in support of the Government of Lebanon, is, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that its area of operations in southern Lebanon is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the UN Security Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">I am advised that there has been no reported security spillover from the Syrian situation into the UNIFIL area of operations.  The Irish battalion serving with UNIFIL, currently the 106th, conducts operations solely within the UNIFIL area of operations in southern Lebanon.  While I understand that there have been a number of recent security incidents along the northern Lebanese Syrian Border, this is a considerable distance from the UNIFIL area of operations and, as such, does not involve UNIFIL and is a matter essentially for the Lebanese authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">I compliment the reputation of our troops on foreign missions.  It has been positive compared with troops from other countries.  Troops from other countries have been involved in certain situations which have done them no credit.  However, the Irish missions have been excellent.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">Is the Minister planning on any of the troops in Lebanon moving out of that UNIFIL area because there was violence recently 45 miles north of Beirut between a small group which was supportive of President Assad and the Sunni majority?  Is there any possibility of our troops being used in that way within Lebanon?  Also, have there been requests or are discussions going on to redeploy our troops in other conflict areas?</p>

            <p eId="para_714">There are no plans to move our troops from the Irish area of operations in southern Lebanon.  There is a discrete area of operations in which the Irish UNIFIL force locate, and that will continue.  Fortunately, the position is still relatively quiet within our area of operations.  There is continued vigilance to ensure that our troops are secure and are in a position to undertake the important work they are undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">The position in Syria is extremely volatile.  It is a matter of continuing concern.  There have been recent incidents in Syria involving some of the UN monitors who are there, not involving our troops but troops from other countries, which are a cause of very serious concern.  None of the Irish monitors or observers was involved in incidents that occurred in recent days but there is continued vigilance of what is happening within Syria.  There is a regular review by the UN of the mission in Syria and its capacity to fulfil its objectives, and we will continue to review the position as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The hope is that the plan to bring about a cessation of violence in Syria will prove successful.  Unfortunately, so far there is continuing violence both from the forces of President Assad and also from those engaged in opposition to him.  Those forces are somewhat fragmented and appear to have various and differing allegiances in the context of the conflict still sadly taking place there.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">We wish our troops well, particularly those in Syria.  As the Minister stated, the position is extremely volatile even though the international media appears to have moved away from it.  Is the Minister in receipt of daily or weekly reports in terms of threat assessment?  I presume that is an evolving situation given the events of recent days.  Are there any plans to send any more Irish troops to Syria in an observation capacity?  Will the mission in Syria end when Mr. Annan's work ends there or does the Minister see a long-term role for Irish troops in Syria?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_718">The initial mission for the monitors is a 90 day mission.  The Deputy might be interested in incidents involving the observers that have occurred in recent days and are a cause of concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">UN reports indicate that the UN supervision mission in Syria had advised the UN that shortly after 2 p.m. local time on 15 May a convoy of four vehicles was struck by an explosion from an improvised explosive device at Khan Cheikhoun, near Hama.  There have been substantial difficulties and substantial loss of life in Hama.  Three UN vehicles were damaged but no UN personnel were hurt in the explosion.  The mission sent a patrol team to the area to help extract those UN military observers.  As I said, no Irish observers were involved.  The mission reported yesterday, 16 May 2012, that it picked up the six UN military observers who had to stay overnight in Khan Cheikhoun after vehicles in their convoy were damaged following the explosion.  They are now back at their team site in Hama.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">Last Tuesday, 15 May, the UN reported from the United Nations supervision mission in Syria that heavy fighting took place on 14 May in Talbisa, in Rastan, and United Nations military observers witnessed that a highway in the area had been blocked by Government forces.  A United Nations military observer patrol helped to de-escalate the situation and got the highway opened after interaction with Government forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The reality, unfortunately, is that there are continuing incidents and concerns with regard to the area.  There are uncertainties about the likelihood of the six-point plan for Syria proposed by UN-Arab League joint special envoy, Kofi Annan, being implemented.  The mission is under ongoing review by the United Nations.  The UN Security Council Resolution 2043 requests the UN Secretary General to report to the Council on the implementation of its resolution every 15 days and also to submit as necessary to the Council proposals for possible adjustments to the mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The current UN mandate expires on 20 July 2012.  Whether the mandate will be renewed remains to be seen and much depends on what happens with regard to the ongoing conflict and the likelihood of the implementation of the six-point plan.  As matters stand there are no plans to send any additional troops from our Defence Forces other than to maintain <i>in situ</i> the six monitors who are there.  Obviously, we will keep a watchful eye on how matters develop with regard to the capacity of the monitors to fulfil a useful function and to meet a mandate in circumstances in which violence appears to be continuing.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I have a general question on the deployment of our troops abroad.  I wonder about the usefulness of the seven personnel in Afghanistan, for example, whereas we have two on the OSCE mission in Bosnia, and there is a danger of escalating problems arising in Bosnia.

            <p eId="para_725">I receive any updates required, bearing in mind circumstances as they evolve.  I am maintaining a continuing interest and closely monitoring what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">In reply to Deputy O'Sullivan, we have small numbers of members of the Deafens Forces located in different parts of the world engaged in UN authorised missions and they are performing important and useful functions.  In parts of the world where we have very small numbers it is members of the Irish Defence forces who are in important command positions with regard to missions involving troops from other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">We have seven members of the Defence Forces in Afghanistan.  Their work is substantially in the administrative areas but our forces there have done important work with regard to improvised explosive devices.  We have substantial expertise in this country in that area.  They have been engaged in training other troops as to how improvised explosive devises can be neutralised.  It is work directly focused on saving lives.  It is very important work, and I know the members of our Defence Forces in Afghanistan are held in high regard.  The work they do is a genuine contribution to trying to end conflict and to protect innocent individuals from the dangers posed by those sort of advices.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">As part of the efforts to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EU ban on turf cutting in special areas of conservation, the NPWS submitted a request to the Department of Defence seeking the transport of NPWS personnel in Air Corps aircraft to monitor these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">The Department of Defence follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour.  For these missions, the Cessna aircraft has been used and the average hourly direct cost of operating this aircraft which include fuel and maintenance costs is €185.  The cost to date in 2012 of providing assistance to the NPWS is €13,875 based on approximately 75 hours of flying time.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">I do not consider the Minister to be someone who would be eager to waste resources.  Given that most people accept the turf will probably be cut in any case, it is probably a waste of money on the part of the State to try to police the issue.  It seems we do not have enough money to keep all our Garda stations open.  I recently spoke to gardaí in Wexford where several stations have been closed and the number of squad cars in the fleet has been cut.  These measures are having a highly damaging effect on the morale of gardaí in the area.  At a time of such scarce resources, it is disappointing the Government sees fit to harass innocent rural people who are availing of their inalienable right to cut turf.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">It is a great pity that the Deputy does not have regard to the substantial fines that could be imposed on the State for failing to comply with European Union regulations with regard to the bogs the Deputy addresses.  The Air Corps and Garda Síochána have an obligation to uphold the law of the State.  If the law of the State was being complied with, there would be no reason for any expenditure of this nature to be incurred.  This is a particularly difficult and protracted dispute that has arisen.  I presume the Deputy has some familiarity with it and the possible liability to the State and taxpayers if the State does not do what is required to uphold a law that has been in place for some years and which the State has failed to implement.  I regret the necessity to spend any resources in this area but if resources are being spent, it is because there are individuals who are intent on continuing to break the law, have not agreed to implement reasonable proposals to resolve the issue and appear to be intent not merely on maintaining the dispute but continuing to break the law.</p>

At one stage it appeared a fair compromise could be reached between the turf cutters, on the one side, and the Government and Europe, on the other, but all reason appears to have disappeared again.  It would be nice if the Government would stand up for citizens.  If it is being bullied by Europe on this issue, perhaps it will garner the courage to stand up for turf cutters given that turf has been cut for 400 years.</p>

            <p eId="para_738">It is a great pity that, as a Member of this House, he will not have regard to the fact that there are laws with which people must comply.  If they are not complied with, those who choose to break them are doing so in circumstances in which they are apparently intent on having fines of tens of thousands of euro imposed on the rest of the community and expect the rest of the community to take them on their shoulders.  My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has done everything humanly possible to have this problem addressed in a manner which is respectful of those who for many years had access to bogs which may no longer be used for turf cutting.  A scheme was proposed and put in place, mediation was organised and it was hoped and understood that this process would produce an outcome.  Unfortunately, it appears there is no possible outcome.  I do not know whether that is simply because of a general incapacity or refusal to understand the serious position the State is in or whether there may be some Member of this House who wants to play politics with the issue for his own benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">Following the Government's decision to further consolidate Defence Forces personnel into fewer locations, four military barracks - Clonmel, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar – closed on 30 March 2012.  As a result of the closure of the four barracks, there is a need to provide alternative accommodation for the local Reserve Defence Force units.  In this regard, my Department placed advertisements in the relevant local newspapers seeking tenders for the provision of suitable accommodation.  Following receipt of the tenders my Department and the military authorities undertook an examination of the proposals received.  This process included, among other things, an assessment of the accommodation offered, particularly in terms of suitability to meet the needs of the local Reserve Defence Force units and compliance with health and safety requirements.  In addition, discussions with the owners of the properties on terms and conditions and what alterations might be required were also undertaken.  As a result, I am pleased that suitable alternative accommodation has been identified in Clonmel, Cavan and Mullingar.  I expect the necessary administrative arrangements will be finalised shortly and formal lease agreements will then be entered into.  The local reserve units can then take possession of their new training accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">With regard to Castlebar, the position is that agreement has been reached between my Department and Mayo County Council for the sale of Mitchell Barracks, Castlebar, to the council.  As part of the sale agreement, Mayo County Council will, for a nominal sum, lease a portion of the barracks to my Department for use by the local reserve unit.  This will obviate the need to lease a property locally, thus reducing the overall costs of providing such accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The leasing of alternative accommodation is a normal arrangement for reserve units in other locations.  The Department of Defence has ten permanent rentals and 30 part-time rentals in place, including part-time use of parish and community halls as well as some commercial premises.  The total annual cost is less than €100,000 for all 40 premises.  Based on these figures, the renting locally of alternative accommodation for the Reserve Defence Force units is the most appropriate course of action and there is no economic argument for keeping a full barracks open to cater for a reserve unit that may only train for a few hours once or twice a week when alternative rented accommodation can be provided for a small fraction of the cost.</p>

            <p eId="para_771">I welcome the fact that some finality has been brought to this issue.  During interaction at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting this week, the Taoiseach agreed that the threat from militant republicanism is especially high at present.  I do not want to reopen the discussion on the closure of Cavan Barracks.  Will the Minister confirm the Reserve Defence Force units affected by the closure of Army barracks have been involved in the decision-making process on relocation?  Has the Minister a timescale for when the training grounds will open?  Is he hopeful they will be open by the middle of the summer?  Finally, will there be relocation costs in moving to the new grounds?</p>

            <p eId="para_773">I am not aware of any additional allowances that would arise by way of relocation costs.  If there is further information on that I will come back to the Deputy.  The locations of the rental premises are within a reasonable distance of the original barracks, where people trained.  If there is additional information I will come back to the Deputy with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">Can the Minister repeat the figures he cited a moment ago?  I think he said there is an agreement to sell the premises to the local authority and lease back a portion of it for a nominal fee.  Did he mention a sum of €100,000?  What does that figure refer to?</p>

            <p eId="para_775">The figure of €100,000 is the total amount for the rental of 40 different premises for the Reserve Defence Force across the country.  Existing leases are in place before the additional ones that are being put in place.  Agreement has been reached with Mayo County Council for the sale of Castlebar Barracks for the sum of €600,000, with payment to be made in four equal instalments of €150,000 each year, commencing in 2012.  Mayo County Council has agreed to lease back a portion of the barracks for use by the local Reserve Defence Force at a nominal sum of €1 per year.  The cost is, therefore, €100,001.  When the leases for the other three are signed I will make the rental cost known to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">I understand Mayo County Council has earmarked Castlebar Barracks for a particular use.  The deal done is based on the facility being provided to the Defence Forces Reserve.  This is very welcome as it means the reserve can continue in a familiar location.</p>

Ongoing discussions are taking place with regard to the other barracks that have been closed.

            <p eId="para_782">Arising from the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure, the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced to 9,500 personnel.  In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  The reorganisation will ensure that, within the strength level of 9,500 Pemanent Defence Force personnel, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is prioritised.  A reduction in the number of Army brigades from the current three to two will bolster the availability of operational personnel by reducing the numbers of military personnel assigned to administrative and support functions.  I tasked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  Work is ongoing in this regard.  The Deputies will appreciate that in advance of receiving a final report, I will not be in a position to discuss likely options or recommendations or to release aspects of the approach as this is an ongoing deliberative process.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">The representative associations and other relevant stakeholders will be consulted on matters that fall within their remit when options on the re-organised structure are considered and the likely impacts are known.</p>

Can the Minister give the House an idea by how many the number of officerships will be reduced?  Have any specific decisions been taken in this regard?  The Minister also said yesterday there would be no barracks closures on the back of the reorganisation of the brigades.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">I will start with the Deputy's last question.  I can confirm that there will not be barracks closures based on the reorganisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">With regard to the Deputy's other questions, I do not want to pre-empt or prejudge the outcome of the process that is underway and in which the Secretary General of my Department, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and officials of my Department and supports of the Chief of Staff are engaged.  They are looking at the overall structure of the Defence Forces and how best to organise matters to maximise capabilities and operational effectiveness.  That will involve looking at how the Defence Forces are currently structured, the numbers required at officer level and the importance of maximising available financial resources to ensure that we have the required number of troops on the ground and that there is not a disproportion between officers and other ranks.  These are all issues for careful concern.  Hard work is going on in the background to deal with this matter in a constructive and progressive way.  I look forward to the completion of that work.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">I do not want to be definitive with regard to timescales as given the complexity of this issue timeframes may not be exactly complied with.  I hope the reorganisation structures and architecture will be agreed before the end of this year, that we will start along the road to implementation and that real change will be seen to be taking place by early next year.  The programme and the manner in which the reorganisation is to be put in place will become known as we go further through the year.  In another eight weeks or so, I should have a clearer view of the exact timeframe by which I would expect to have the final report from the process that is now under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">I understand the Minister will visit Custume Barracks in Athlone on Monday next, to make an announcement regarding an air ambulance service.  He will be very welcome in Athlone.  We have been campaigning for 13 years for a helicopter emergency service and we hope the Minister's announcement will be the first stage in seeing it happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">There is much concern in Custume Barracks about the proposed two brigade structure.  When the proposal was previously mooted the Defence Forces were anxious that a brigade would be based in the Dublin metropolitan area.  At the time, an analysis was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers recommending that there be a taskforce for the Dublin area and that one of the two brigades would cover the northern half of the country and one would cover the southern half.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">What is the status of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report?  It did recommend the structures the Minister is now considering.  Will he take the recommendations of the report into consideration before he makes a final decision on this matter?</p>

All I can say to the Deputy is that all issues of relevance will be taken into account as we switch from a three-brigade structure to a two-brigade structure.  The operational and capacity issues will be taken into account and how best to deal with a broad range of matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">In regard to Athlone, as a consequence of the closures that have taken place, as the Deputy may be aware, there is now an increased number in Athlone Barracks.  It is in the region of 1,050.  The future of Athlone Barracks is secure.  I will not pre-empt in any way any recommendations or try to second guess any recommendations that might be made to me with regard to the reorganisation that is taking place.  In particular with regard to decisions as to where the headquarters of where the particular brigades should be located.</p>

            <p eId="para_793">I accept there is no threat to the future of Custume Barracks in Athlone.  It would be ludicrous in the current context considering it is now the biggest Army barracks in the country.  However, the concern locally relates to the redeployment of troops from Custume Barracks to other barracks around the country.  Could the Minister clarify whether such a redeployment will take place and the number that will be involved if Custume Barracks were to lose the western command headquarters which it currently holds?</p>
            <p eId="para_794">It was pointed out in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that to maximise the use of resources, the best thing to do would be to have a two-brigade structure, one for the northern half of the country which could be easily operated from Custume Barracks in Athlone, and one for the southern half of the country and to have a taskforce for the Dublin area – that there should not be a brigade headquarters based in Dublin.  What is the status of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report?  Will its recommendations be taken into consideration before a final decision is made?</p>

            <p eId="para_795">I hope the Deputy understands that if a process is under way with regard to a reorganisation of the Defence Forces, issues of deployment will be part of the issues that are considered within the context of that process.  I appreciate that the Deputy is essentially making the case that a brigade headquarters should continue to be based in Athlone.  I presume that every Member of this House who represents Cork would make the same case on behalf of Cork and every Member who represents various constituencies in Dublin would make the same case on behalf of Dublin.  I have asked that a process be undertaken to examine what is in the interests of the country with regard to how we should reorganise the Defence Forces.  The location of brigade headquarters is part of the process.  I will not second-guess the process; I simply reiterate what I have said to the Deputy, that any issues of relevance that should be considered in the deliberative process that is now under way will be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_797">I propose to circulate a table with the Official Report, which outlines the number of vacancies in the Permanent Defence Force by rank.  The number of vacancies, by rank, is based on the employment control framework of 10,000 - all ranks - in the Permanent Defence Force, versus the strength of 8,885 as at 30 April 2012.  This is the latest date for which figures are available.  As the House is aware, the Government agreed that the strength of the Defences Forces by the end of the year would be maintained at 9,500.  The recruitment process has already started.  Competitions under the new fully competitive merit-based promotion schemes agreed for generals have taken place while competitions for officers and non-commissioned officers are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">As the Deputy will be aware a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces has been initiated resulting from the Government decision to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500.  This reorganisation, which will prioritise front line service delivery, will have an impact on the number of vacancies in each rank.  I have asked the Chief-of-Staff and the Secretary General of my Department to bring forward detailed reorganisation proposals for my consideration.  Work is ongoing in this regard.  The effect of the changes on promotion cannot be determined until the proposals are considered and decisions made.  Promotions will be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to defence during the course of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_851">Not all ranks are under-resourced.  Based on the employment control framework figure of 10,000, the current strength of the Defence Forces of just under 9,000 indicates that we have an excess of captains - there are 30 too many – but the number of sergeants and corporals is down by 485.  I understand the numbers are to be rebalanced under the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  Is there a timeframe for when that will happen?  I accept the brigade structure is being reorganised from three to two at the moment.  Will there be an interview process to fill in the shortfall in the ranks?  We received the reply by email so I am aware of the figures.  The table indicates we have 30 captains too many.  I presume it is hoped to promote some of them up to the next rank to balance the figures across the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_852">In the context of dealing with the general issue, first, part of the process in which we are now engaging is to examine the balance between members of particular ranks and ordinary members of the Defence Forces to ensure there is not a disproportion in the context of those at officer level as compared to enlisted personnel.  In the absence of the final report I will receive from the Chief-of-Staff and the Secretary General, it is not possible to state what the distribution of ranks in the new structure will be.  I emphasise that the key focus will be on ensuring the operational capabilities of the Permanent Defence Force are maximised as opposed to maintaining ratios.  During the course of this year some promotions are taking place and, where appropriate, competitions are being held.  In the context of decisions made, we will bear in mind that decisions made should not create a difficulty with regard to there being a disproportionate ratio of officers to ordinary personnel.  There is an important issue in that context in terms of maximising the use of resources.  We must ensure we have the enlisted personnel we require, which is why we have started the process of recruitment.  As the Deputy is aware from a previous announcement I made, there will be 600 recruits to the Defence Forces this year, which will ensure we return to the level of 9,500 after the various retirements that have taken place.  Later in the year we will have a clearer perspective of matters with regard to the officers in the Defence Forces and the proportionality between officers and enlisted members.</p>

            <p eId="para_856">Since the closure of Magee Barracks in Kildare town and particularly in recent years, the site has fallen into disrepair and all buildings have been severely vandalised.  It has also been the focus of anti-social behaviour.  My Department has continued, where necessary, to take additional security measures to secure and protect the site.  In cases where local residents have notified my Department of any undesirable activity in the area, it has responded immediately to such reports.  Departmental officials have met with senior Garda personnel to discuss the difficulties being encountered with the site.  In addition, I met with Kildare Chamber of Commerce in November 2011 and had a constructive exchange of views on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">Based on the views expressed by An Garda Síochána in regard to the condition of the buildings on site, the question of their demolition is now being considered.  A difficulty arises, however, in that some of them are listed as protected structures.  My Department wrote to Kildare County Council in December 2011 in regard to this matter and departmental officials will meet with officials from the council next week to progress the issue.  The council is in the process of preparing a local development plan for Kildare town, including the former barracks, and my Department has made a submission in this regard.  We welcome the initiative of the council in preparing this local area plan and will be informed by it in our efforts to dispose of the site with a view to providing revenue for reinvestment in the Defence Forces and additional amenities for the local community.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is devising a national cyber security policy aimed at protecting economic infrastructure and informing and assisting citizens in this regard.  I understand his Department is also preparing an awareness campaign focused on cyber security and aimed at individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, the education sector, the public sector and business.

            <p eId="para_860">In the context of the roles of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, considerable resources are invested in minimising the threat associated with cyber attacks and malicious security breaches, including investment in training.  The Defence Forces take comprehensive security measures in deploying their information and communications systems, whether in Ireland or overseas.  Details of measures taken are not publicised for security reasons.  The European Commission published a proposal for a directive on attacks against information systems in September 2010 and the Department of Justice and Equality is closely engaged in the progress of that proposal.</p>

In the United Kingdom, for example, we have seen a large number of critical websites taken down as a form of protest.  Government websites containing private data relating to citizens are particularly vulnerable to such attacks.  How many Defence Forces personnel are engaged in the area of information technology protection and security?  Are there external consultants undertaking strategy work in this regard on behalf of the Defence Forces?

            <p eId="para_862">Two members of the Defence Forces and two members of An Garda Síochána with expertise in this area are part of a committee which is led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This is an issue I raised very soon after my ministerial appointment.  As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, I have briefed the committee on issues relating to possible cyber attacks and related issues.  The challenges for cyber defence fall into two areas, namely, prevention and the response to emergencies or incidents arising from cyber attacks or systems failures.  Activity is taking place across several Departments and agencies in an effort to guard against systems failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is the central Department in dealing with this issue.  We have already had cases of cyber attacks in this State, including an organised attack on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of an inordinately large numbers of individuals seeking simultaneously to access the site, resulting in problems which persisted for several hours.  Counter action has been taken to address this and it is my understanding that a second subsequent attempt to disrupt the site proved unsuccessful.  As I said, work in this area comes under the centralised remit of the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte's, Department and the Government task force will be kept informed of progress in this regard.  It is an issue in which I have a particular interest, even though the Department of Justice and Equality is not engaged centrally on the technical aspects of the work.</p>

The figure relating to smaller properties already disposed of, as set out in the table, is €16,777,592.  In the current market it amounts to an artificial exercise to seek to put a value on the group of smaller properties earmarked for disposal.

            <p eId="para_1007">As I understand, there are no major security costs associated with the properties we are discussing.  Some of them are married quarters which are now vacated.  There are some married quarters that were supposed to have been vacated some years ago but have not been, for a variety of reasons.  In the past, these matters have been the subject of Dáil questions.  With regard to individual properties that are not utilised, if there are practical uses to which they can be put in the context of local communities, we will consider that constructively.  There is no funding available within the Department to convert properties in any particular way, but if there are good ideas about vacant properties for which the Department has no use, they will be considered.  The Department obviously has an interest in realising value from those properties because moneys realised are re-invested in resources for the Defence Forces.  However, we are in a different financial climate from that which prevailed three or four years ago.  Values are substantially less than they used to be.  In dealing with individual properties, I and my officials are realistic about funding that may be realised from individual properties, depending on their condition and location.  I encourage both Deputies in the House to pass on any good ideas they have about individual vacant properties that do not appear to be moving in any particular direction.  When dealing with what are essentially residential properties, there is the possibility of their being put on the market and sold at a realistic price to provide accommodation, where that is appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">The main overseas mission in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The second rotation of Irish personnel serving with the mission since Irish troops returned to Lebanon in May 2011 was completed this week with the deployment of personnel of the 106th Irish Infantry Battalion to UNIFIL.  The 106th Infantry Battalion, comprising some 332 personnel, will form part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion in UNIFIL with effect from June 2012, when a contingent of 170 personnel of the Finnish defence forces will integrate with the Irish battalion.  The joint Irish-Finnish battalion will be based in sector west of UNIFIL's area of operations, currently centred on the major towns of Tibnin and Bint Jubayl, with two posts on the Blue Line which separates Lebanon and Israel.  The battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts while operating in close co-ordination and co-operation with the Lebanese armed forces in sector west.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Early last month, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan was selected by the United Nations as Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL from April 2012.  He assumed his appointment on 28 April 2012.  I know the House will join me in congratulating Brigadier General Phelan and wishing him and the personnel of the 106th Infantry Battalion safe and successful tours of duty in an area that, at the moment, is reasonably quiet.</p>

It is a testament to the fine tradition of the Irish Defence Forces in UNIFIL that he has attained that position.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the 332 soldiers who have headed out there and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">In light of our earlier discussion about the escalating situation in Syria, has any thought gone into the possibility of associated instability in Lebanon?  Will that influence any future decisions about the deployment of UNIFIL troops generally in the Lebanese area?</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">The mandate for UNIFIL remains unchanged in the context of the particular issues that gave rise to it.  This is a very volatile region of the world.  I do not think anyone can predict with certainty how matters may develop in the coming months, never mind the coming years.  Currently, there some refugees from Syria in Lebanon, and there are some reports of disturbances close to the Syria-Lebanon border, but so far, fortunately, the events in Syria have not spilled over into Lebanon to any dramatic degree.  The hope is that this will not occur.  The politics of Lebanon, including the connections between, for example, Hizbollah and the Syrian regime and the divisions that exist, unfortunately, along sectarian lines within the Lebanese Government mean that this is a particularly complicated area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">I had the privilege of meeting a number of members of the Lebanese Government when I visited our troops in October last.  I spoke to the President and the Prime Minister as well as other members of the Government, all of whom come from different communities and political backgrounds, and they were very appreciative of the work done by our troops there.  Our engagement with UNIFIL is seen as a positive contribution to the area.  Our troops continue to engage with the local community in a supportive way, including by providing funding and local supports for community matters.  It is my hope that the troops who have now gone out there will have a safe mission.  I had the privilege of seeing them off at McKee Barracks, and I hope to have the opportunity to visit in early autumn.  At that stage I will have another opportunity to meet my counterparts in Lebanon, the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Justice.  The hope is that the area remains quiet and the events that are occurring so close to it do not give rise to any difficulties.</p>

Pursuant to their role in rendering aid to the civil power, the Defence Forces have a number of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams on call, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to respond to requests received from An Garda Síochána for assistance in dealing with a suspect device or for the removal of old ordnance.   The cost of individual callouts are not recorded separately as each deployment is different and this does not lend itself to providing average costs due to the unpredictable nature and location of each call-out.  However, some of the associated costs involved would include the salary and allowances that are payable to the team, the cost of fuel for the distance travelled by the vehicles despatched to and from the location of the incident, and the cost of any ordnance that has to be used to dispose of the device.</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">Vehicle safety training, as with all military training is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.    The current Defence Forces Driver Training Policy Instruction was first issued in 2006 and last updated in 2011. It is a comprehensive instruction covering all aspects of driver training. The aim of this instruction is to apply a safe, suitable and flexible system of driver training which suits the Defence Forces operational needs while maintaining and improving current high driving standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">I am advised that the issue of safety is constantly addressed across the range of driver training syllabi currently in use within the Defence Forces. Modularised sections within each syllabus contain health and safety briefs together with the necessary safety equipment to be used specific to the vehicle in question. Reference documentation relating to health and safety is also listed on each syllabus and discussed during lectures and in practical training sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">The Defence Forces has introduced re-currency training for all driver instructors and driver testers and such training is conducted annually in the Transport School, Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC). The training brings attendees up to date with best practice and latest information on driver training, specialist vehicles, etc., together with information on legislation and licensing within the Defence Forces and in the civilian domain. By way of example, a recent re-currency seminar in the DFTC received presentations from the Road Safety Authority and An Garda Síochána. Driver testers and instructors are required to undergo such training biennially.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">While the focus to date has been on the roll-out of re-currency training for driver testers and instructors, it is also intended that similar training for all drivers will be conducted in each Brigade/Formation. As with testers and instructors, individual drivers will also be required to undergo such training biennially.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">On the issue of vehicle safety, a Vehicle Technical Monitoring System (VTMS) was installed on the Defence Forces Fleet of eighty MOWAG armoured personnel carriers in May 2011.This system is expected to help improve driver behaviour including a reduction in vehicle speed. The system can provide accurate real-time data in the event of a road traffic accident. In the event of a road traffic accident involving a vehicle fitted with the VTMS, all driver behaviour prior to the accident can be reviewed. This can help to establish an accurate and true chain of events and provides the Defence Forces with a strong base of information in the investigation of any such accident.</p>

            <p eId="para_1026">The Government has decided to accept my recommendation that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be maintained at 9,500.  I believe that this is the optimum strength required to fulfil all roles currently assigned by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">As the Permanent Defence Force is currently below the agreed serving cadre there will be an intake in 2012, of approximately 600 personnel, consisting primarily of the phased recruitment of General Service Recruits and an intake of 42 Cadets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">All such recruitment will be achieved within the resource envelope allocated to Defence so as to maintain the Government approved strength of the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">There is no decision at this point as to the allocation of new personnel from the current recruitment competition, the closing date of which was 22 April 2012.  Ultimately the deployment of these personnel will be in line with operational requirements.  It is planned to assign recruits to the Army and Naval Service, as currently there are no general service vacancies in the Air Corps.</p>

            <p eId="para_1037">I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including equipment and training resources, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence.  However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, look to whatever efficiencies we can make.  We must take into account the current difficult economic environment.  This will determine the overall financial envelope available for the Department for the acquisition of new military equipment and for upgrading and refurbishment programmes over the coming years.  The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades in that period.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">The provision allocated in 2012 specifically for the purchase of defensive equipment is €27.5m.  This allows for the acquisition of a range of priority defensive equipment such as Force Protection Equipment, Chemical Agent Detection Equipment and the implementation of a Rifle Enhancement Programme for the in-service Steyr Rifle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations.  In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">The provision for 2012 also allows for the acquisition of ammunition types needed to maintain stocks given the training and overseas requirements throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government.  The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training.  The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government including provision of assistance to the civil authorities in any emergency situations that may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda Síochána. However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda Síochána when requested to do so.  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda Síochána in relation to ATCP issues.  Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they will continue to provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather emergency in Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The various procedures that are in place, both nationally and locally, were seen to operate very effectively during the Winter of 2010 as the Defence Forces made all assets, resources and capabilities available to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the periods of severe weather that occurred that Winter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1047">Ireland participates in the framework of the European Defence Agency and I, as the Minister for Defence, represent Ireland on the EDA Steering Board along with Defence Ministers of all participating EU Member States.  The primary reason for Ireland's interaction and participation in the EDA is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for crisis management and international Peace Support Operations.  Since its inception, the Agency has made significant progress on many military capability projects and programmes in support of EU crisis management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">As part of the EDA's annual work programme, Ireland participates in project teams and working groups engaged in the ongoing work in various capability development areas that will be of benefit to the Defence Forces.  Ireland engages in project teams dealing with improved communication and network systems for use in operations; health and medical support for military operations, and the development of improved Counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) capability to enable military forces operate safely in an environment where such devices are present.  From their experience in dealing with Improvised Explosive Devices, the Defence Forces provide technical advice and support to the Agency.  In addition, we participate in project teams dealing with Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear protection (CBRN) which is of benefit both nationally and on military missions overseas and; maritime surveillance which will enhance our capabilities in monitoring marine activities and the maritime environment in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The four main initiatives that Ireland is currently involved in are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1050">The Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP) which was launched by the Agency in 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1051">The Maritime Surveillance Project launched in 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1052">The Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear protection project launched in 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1053">Ireland has taken a lead role in a Naval Training study, involving a group of eleven Member States, launched in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Ireland does not have any personnel seconded to the Agency. The majority of meetings and working groups are staffed by a departmental official who is assigned to Ireland's Permanent Representation to the EU.  Also, the staffing of some project team meetings and working groups are attended by Departmental and Defence Forces personnel from Ireland on an ad hoc basis.  No staff within the Defence Organisation work full time on these initiatives.  An estimate of the cost to staff a one day meeting in Brussels would be, on average, in the region of €550.00, which would include flights and accommodation, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">In order to maximise the opportunities presented from Ireland's participation in the Agency, the Defence Organisation is consulting with Enterprise Ireland who can promote and assist Irish Industry and Research Institution involvement in potential contract opportunities arising from EDA projects and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">Ireland contributes, on an annual basis, to the operational budget of the Agency.  The financial commitment of participants to this budget is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on the gross national income (GNI) key.  In 2011 Ireland's contribution was €284,047 and to date in 2012 we have contributed €209,656 to the operational budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_1077">On 21 April 2012, unanimously adopting resolution 2043 (2012), the United Nations Security Council authorized the establishment, for an initial period of 90 days, of a supervision mission, known as the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS).  The purpose of the mission is to monitor a cessation of armed violence "in all its forms by all parties" in Syria.  The new mission is also tasked with monitoring the full implementation of the six-point plan proposed by Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the League of Arab States, Mr. Kofi Annan.  On 24th April 2012, the Government approved the deployment of up to six members of the Permanent Defence Force as unarmed military observers to UNSMIS, in response to a request from the United Nations.  Six Defence Forces personnel were deployed to the mission area on 11 May 2012.  The role of the Irish personnel is to observe and report on the security situation, and any transgressions of the ceasefire agreement and the implementation of the six-point plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The UN mission will comprise an initial deployment of up to 300 military observers, under the command of a Chief Military Observer, with an appropriate civilian component as required by the mission to fulfil its mandate.

The other members of the Austro-German Battle group are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).  Our contribution will be a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters amounting to approximately 175 personnel.  Leading up to and during the standby period one officer has been deployed to the Battle group Headquarters in Ulm, Germany.  This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battle group operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures —"Triple Lock", i.e. UN mandate, Government and Dáil approval.  The issue of Battle group usability and flexibility has been discussed at the EU Defence Ministers meetings I have attended.  Also, within the EU itself, a number of committees, including the Political and Security Committee and the EU Military Committee, keep the issue of Battle group response under constant review in consultation with all EU Member States.  Any decision to deploy the Austro-German Battle group will continue to be taken by unanimity by the Council of the European Union.  As such, Ireland will retain the sovereign right to decide on participation in any crisis management mission involving the Austro/German Battle group.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_1095">I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28, 32, 34, 36, 37 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">The Government is gravely concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in several areas of Sudan, most notably in the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where an estimated 350,000 civilians have been severely affected by fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N). In addition to those affected within these two states, some 140,000 refugees have already fled to Ethiopia and South Sudan, while 100,000 more have been displaced as a result of fighting around the disputed border area of Abyei.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">Ireland, together with our EU partners is responding to the situation and is supporting efforts to bring an end to the continuing conflict across the border region. We are particularly concerned about the issue of humanitarian access for NGOs and international relief agencies to the areas affected by conflict. We have raised the issue of access at EU level and in other international fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">In January last, and with Ireland's encouragement, the European Union urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to all those in need. The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to moving forward with the full range of support that the EU would like to provide to Sudan. Last month, the EU called on the Government of Sudan and the SPLM North to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the conflict in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">On 2 May, the United Nations Security Council adopted a Resolution condemning the recent cross-border conflict between Sudan and South Sudan including support to proxy forces and aerial bombardment. The Resolution called on both parties to cease all hostilities within 48 hours of the adoption of the resolution, to withdraw their forces, to activate previously agreed on security mechanisms and to resume negotiations under the auspices of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">Despite huge challenges, humanitarian agencies are managing to gain limited access to some vulnerable communities in South Kordofan. Both the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have provided assistance to displaced people and affected host communities. Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has recently allocated €2 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.These funds are being used to help UN agencies target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas beset by conflict and affected by displacement from Blue Nile and South Kordofan.A further €1.22 million has been made available to Irish NGOs for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Humanitarian Programme Planning (HPP) funding scheme. We are actively examining the possibility of providing further support as access conditions improve and the needs on the ground become clearer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan and the Nuba Mountains, and along with our EU partners we will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">There are currently 300 people on the Department's Election Observation Roster.  The roster is not open for new members at present, but, given the interest in participation and the need to identify new members with specific skills, especially language skills, I have asked officials to review the working of the roster and to prepare proposals on future membership.  This review is nearing conclusion and I will decide on proposals for future membership of the roster in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">There is at present no formal process for leaving the election observation roster, but members can ask to have their membership deactivated.  In order to address a shortage of observers with strong language skills, a recruitment drive for French and Spanish speakers was held between 2008 and 2010.  Since 2008 there have also been some new members who qualify for inclusion based on their status as public representatives.  There is no upper age limit for membership of the roster and observers of all ages participate on missions once they have been certified as fit by their doctor.  A full list of the numbers of people who have joined or left the roster between 2008 and 2011 is provided in tabular form below:</p>

            <p eId="para_1122">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.  When a request for electoral observation is received, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  A list of suitably qualified observers is then drawn up, taking into account the length of time since their last mission as well as any specific criteria for the mission, including country and regional experience and relevant language proficiency, if applicable.  Attention is also given to contributing to the OSCE's commitment to achieving a better gender balance on missions, as well as the need for Ireland to increase the number of experienced observers on our roster.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The OSCE decided to send a limited election observation mission, comprising 10 long-term observers, for the Parliamentary elections in Serbia on 6 May.  Ireland provided one member of this observation team and she returned to Ireland on 10 May.  The first round of the Presidential election coincided with the Parliamentary election on 6 May and the second round of Presidential elections is scheduled to take place in Serbia on 20 May. The OSCE has decided to extend the limited observation mission to cover the second round Presidential election.  Ireland has provided one-long term observer to participate in this mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">A full OSCE election observation mission observed the parliamentary elections in Armenia on 6 May.

              <i>I have stated publicly my view that the widespread use by Israel of administrative detention should cease, and that the punitive conditions imposed on prisoners while Gilad Shalit was in captivity should be ended.   EU Missions in the Palestinian territories — including our Mission in Ramallah — made a public statement expressing concern at the hunger strikes and the use of administrative detention last week. Our Embassy in Tel Aviv also conveyed my views directly to the Foreign Ministry. In addition, officials in my Department conveyed to the Israeli Ambassador my view that a solution must be found which will enable the strikes to come to an end without a tragic outcome.</i>

              <i>I am very pleased, therefore, by the announcements from both Israeli and Palestinian officials that agreements have been reached on the issues under contention, and that all prisoners have accordingly agreed to end their hunger strikes. Details will emerge in due course, but it is understood that Israel has extensively reviewed the issues raised by the prisoners, and is to reduce its recourse to administrative detention, as well as to make changes in prison conditions, including ending solitary confinement for many prisoners, and permitting family visits from Gaza. The prisoners have for their part made various undertakings. It will be possible at a later stage to assess what long-term changes have been made.</i>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1133">I have reported to the House on a number of occasions in relation to my visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in January.   I would refer the Deputy in particular to my reply to Dáil Question No. 101 on 31 January.     During the course of my visit in January, I met with a range of political leaders in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, including President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu.  My visit enabled me to discuss key political concerns with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority and to reinforce Ireland's excellent bilateral ties with both.  Developments in relation to the Middle East peace process have been reviewed regularly by the Foreign Affairs Council and I have contributed actively to these discussions, drawing on the insights gained during my visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">A major discussion of the Middle East peace process took place at the Foreign Affairs Council this week and important conclusions issued from this.  Ireland, with its EU partners, continues to believe strongly that ultimately a resolution to the conflict in the Middle East can come only through a comprehensive, negotiated two state settlement which addresses the Palestinian people's legitimate desire for a viable, contiguous Palestinian state of their own as well as the Israeli people's equally legitimate wish to reside within secure, recognised borders.  I believe that such an outcome remains very much in the best interests of both Israel and the Palestinian people and that this week's Foreign Affairs Council discussion and conclusions have contributed in a very positive way to keeping the perspective of a two-State solution both viable and central to current peace efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">I have not disguised the serious concerns which Ireland has in this connection about current Israeli Government policies in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territories.   However, in my view political differences of this kind should not prevent us from seeking to develop Ireland's relations with Israel in other spheres.  I was happy to attend the opening of the Israeli Film Festival in Dublin last November.   I made clear on that occasion that the Government does not support cultural or other boycotts against Israel.  Irish artists are free to decide for themselves whether or not to engage with Israel.  While the Government is firmly opposed to campaigns which seek to impose a cultural boycott on Israel, it is the right of others to take a contrary view.   However, I would regard as unacceptable efforts to harass artists with a view to intimidating them from exercising their freedom of choice in relation to engagement with Israel.</p>

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography for important events where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated. As the table indicates there were a significant number of such events in 2011.  In September 2011, my Department led a collaborative advertised tender process for the procurement of a multi-supplier competitive framework of photographic service providers. This is now available for use by all Government Departments. Details of the new framework arrangements are posted on the National Procurement Service website: <i>www.procurement.ie/suppliers/contracts/1298</i>. The purpose of this framework is to ensure Departments’ compliance with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money by having a competitive process for photographic assignments.</p>

I might also add that my Department and the Embassy network work closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the State Agencies to support the promotion of Ireland as a leading location for financial services.  Our Embassies are in a position to raise matters of concern to Ireland's international financial services industry abroad and they regularly assist the work of IFSC Ireland and others in the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">The Government's decision to close Ireland's resident Embassy to the Holy See was taken with the greatest regret and reluctance. It was driven by economic factors deriving from our need to cut public expenditure and focus the modest resources of our diplomatic service on economic recovery.  The logic for closure was based on the fact that the Embassy was not involved in consular services or trade promotion and that essential issues of Church-State relations could be handled relatively well by a non-resident Ambassador.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">The Government nominated the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. David Cooney, as non-resident Ambassador to the Holy See. His nomination was accepted, and Mr. Cooney presented his credentials to Pope Benedict on 4 May 2012.  Net savings in respect of the closure of the resident Embassy to the Holy See are estimated at €400,000 this year and €845,000 in 2013.  These projections take into consideration the relocation of the offices of the Embassy to Italy and the residence of the Ambassador to Italy to the state-owned Villa Spada.  It is expected that the transfer will be completed during the course of the present year and that the full year rental savings, amounting to €445,000, will be realised in 2013.  As I have previously stated in this House, the decision to close the resident Embassy to the Holy See will not be reversed in the immediate term. However, as the economic situation improves, and in the context of the regular review of our diplomatic network, it may be possible to revisit the matter at some time in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1204">The National Asset Management Agency has been generally positive in their comments on the subject of REITs and their potential to be used as a tool in achieving NAMA's goals.   Although I considered a number of options before the Budget, including the introduction of a REIT structure, I decided to take a different approach to facilitating investment in the property market.  I reduced the rate of Stamp Duty on non-residential property from 6% (in most cases) to 2%, and introduced a relief from Capital Gains Tax for property purchased within the "incentive period" between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2013, where that property is retained for at least seven years.  These measures are intended to promote investment and employment in property and related sectors.  The possibility of introducing a REIT structure will be kept under review in light of the performance of the property market after the recent changes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1212">I would point out that fiscal sustainability and measures to promote economic growth are not necessarily incompatible.  In this context, the Taoiseach has consistently sought to have growth moved up the European agenda.  My view is that measures to boost the economic growth rate can play an important role in addressing the current crisis in the EU.  In fact, implementing policies to boost growth in the euro area is one of the key parts of the ‘five-point strategy' to tackle the crisis agreed by the euro area Heads of State or Government last October.   Implementing structural reforms can have a positive effect in terms of boosting the rate of growth in many Member States and my view is that these should be implemented without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">In addition, there are calls in some quarters for fiscal measures to stimulate growth in the short term.  A number of considerations arise in this regard.  For instance, for those Member States subject to market pressures, it is clear that these have little, if any, room for budgetary manoeuvre.  It goes without saying, however, that consolidation in these Member States should be pursued in a manner which is as growth-friendly as possible.   It is also important to bear in mind that additional public sector borrowing designed to stimulate the economy in the short-term could increase public indebtedness and may well act as a restraint on medium term economic growth, thus having a counter-productive impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">Having said this, borrowing at a reasonable cost — through for instance the European Investment Bank — to fund projects that yield a sufficient rate of return may be justified, and Member States that can afford to pursue such an approach are of course free to do so.  Indeed, we are pursuing all options in that regard.  It is also worth pointing out that the Government has a public capital programme amounting to €17 billion over the period 2012-2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">In the case of Ireland we must be particularly conscious of the impact that any fiscal stimulus would have on the public finances.  As the deputy will be aware, the Government has secured the approval of the Troika to use a portion of the funds raised from the sale of state assets to support jobs and growth.  It is crucial that any such investment yields maximum benefits in terms of boosting the long-term growth of the economy and minimum costs in terms of the impact on the public finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1217">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that allowing a person to use a toll road or toll bridge is the provision of a service for VAT purposes that is liable at the standard rate, currently 23%.  The application of VAT on such charges is governed by EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply. A European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling on this issue in 2000 meant that Ireland was required to apply VAT at the standard rate on all existing and future roads and bridges which are subject to tolls. The VAT treatment of tolled facilities was amended in the Finance Act 2001 to take account of the court judgment and provide that taxable persons engaged in providing such services account for VAT at the standard rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">A subsequent ECJ ruling in 2009 provided that the activities of public bodies, in general, are liable to VAT where such activities could lead to something more than negligible distortion of competition.  Irish VAT legislation was amended to make such activities liable to VAT from 1 July 2010.  Public bodies engaged in the operation of toll roads and toll bridges are liable to charge VAT at the standard rate from 1 July 2010.  The Deputy may be referring to recent media commentary in respect of a possible appeal by the National Road Authority in respect of toll roads operated by the NRA. The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment on individual cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1220">Together with the NTMA, my Department is open to proposals relating to the issuance of Government bonds that would allow Ireland to return to the international debt markets in a sustainable manner as soon as possible.   Turning to the Deputy's question, I am informed by the NTMA that investors in Irish Government bonds legitimately expect that tax receipts form a substantial part of the revenue stream to meet Ireland's debt obligations as they fall due. Such investors rank "pari passu" (i.e. equally amongst themselves) and would not expect investors in tax backed bonds to be granted a preference in terms of payment obligations, particularly if any significant volume were to be issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">Furthermore, even if tax backed bonds were to be issued at a lower yield, an increased cost may be demanded from other bond investors who would not have been offered similar terms and who would have to rely on a potentially diminished pool of revenue streams to cover the obligations due to them.  Due to current market conditions, investors are reacting very negatively to any perceived or potential future subordination of their claims. The uncertainty caused by the widespread introduction of tax backed bonds could be expected to lead existing investors to reduce their holdings of Irish Government bonds, thus adversely affecting the yields on all new issues of Irish Government debt.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">The Education Finance Board is an independent statutory body established in 1996 pursuant to section 23 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005. Funding for the Board has been provided from the €12.7 million contribution provided by the religious congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families.  Prior to the establishment of the Board, grants were paid to eligible applicants under an administrative scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The principal functions of the Board are to pay grants in accordance with the provisions of the 2005 Act; determine and publish the criteria for the payment of such grants; provide information in relation to education services for which grants are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Grants approved by the Board are in respect of tuition fees and educational assistance for the current academic year.  Following its establishment, the Board decided in the case of applicants undertaking multi-annual courses to estimate the costs to completion of the applicant's course and to reserve the lower of the amount of these future costs or the balance of the person's overall grant limit in accordance with the annual and overall limits as set in the Criteria for Awarding Grants of the relevant year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">The level of applications to the Board increased significantly after 2008 and during 2011 it was clear to the Board that its remaining funds would be depleted at an early date.  The Board decided that it could continue its policy of reserving funds for subsequent years of multi-annual courses only in the case of applicants to whom grants had already been awarded for the 2010-2011 or previous academic years.  Accordingly, since July 2011 new applicants have been advised that their grant approval is a once-off grant with no commitment to any future grant in the case of their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">The Board advised me last year that it expected that its funds would be fully allocated on applications received by end November, 2011.  It publicised that it was not therefore in a position to process any applications received after that date.  The Board has a backlog of applications received prior to 30th November, which it is continuing to process until the remaining funds are fully allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Part 4 of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, 2012 dissolves the Education Finance Board and transfers its functions to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board in relation to the moneys remaining from the €12.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The Deputy will also be aware that the proposed Statutory Fund will be in a position to assist eligible former residents to avail of education services.  It is expected that some 15,000 former residents, whether living here in Ireland or abroad, will successfully complete the redress process and be eligible to apply for services that they need.  I am aware of demands to widen eligibility to include relatives of former residents, including children and grandchildren.  However, I believe that having regard to the potential pool of applicants and the maximum funds of €110m that will be available to the Fund, the proposed approach is correct. The question of reviewing the eligibility under the Statutory Fund could, however, be considered following the establishment of the Fund in the event of applications not resulting in a significant expenditure of the Fund.</p>

However, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, students entering new postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme.  This would appear to be the situation in the case adverted to by the Deputy.  Existing postgraduate students in receipt of a grant for their current course and continuing on the same course in the 2012/13 academic year will not be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  My Department estimates that this will help an additional 4,000 postgraduate students.  There will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.

            <p eId="para_1307">The SPHE Whole School Anti-Bullying Support programme addresses racist bullying in a number of ways including giving specific examples of racist bullying in SPHE lessons, identifying unacceptable racist behaviour at SPHE workshops and encouraging schools to include racism as an important topic when organising Friendship Weeks.  At Primary level schools are advised that the Strands: "My Friends and Other People" and "Myself and the Wider World" include objectives under which schools can include specific lessons on racism where children learn to be aware of and appreciate the diversity of cultures and people in addition to appreciating the diversity of people or groups within communities and the importance of mutual respect, empathy and understanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">My Departments Guidelines on Countering Bullying in Primary and Post Primary Schools (1993) require all schools to have an anti bullying policy.  It is the responsibility of school management to ensure that the guidelines are followed and if training is required, it is available from the relevant Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">I am satisfied that the SPHE provides adequate support and training to teachers and schools in the area of anti racist bullying and I have no plans to make additional funding available to outside groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_1311">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) can also assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">I can also advise that children are eligible for transport under the Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability in accordance with the designation of high and low incidence disability set out in Department of Education and Skill's (DES) Circular 02/05 and where they are attending the nearest recognised: mainstream school, special class/special school or a unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet their special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1377">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 95,000 rent supplement recipients with a forecast outturn of €437 million provided for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">The Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector so it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">The new maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">The person concerned is in receipt of rent supplement assessed on her current rent of €925 per month. She was advised that the new rent limit appropriate to her family circumstances is €875 per month.  As this person has no current lease with her landlord she was advised that her rent supplement would continue based on €935 per month for 13 weeks giving time to renegotiate with her landlord or to seek alternative accommodation at or below the appropriate rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1392">Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensuring work is worthwhile.  To this end, last year I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on them, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to the Group including the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">The Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support. Decisions in respect of publishing reports of the Group will be made at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">The Group has recently concluded its examination of the issue of child and family income supports and the Group's report has been submitted to me.  The report is currently receiving my consideration and it is my intention to publish the report in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_1401">I advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that in this case the claim to state pension (contributory) was disallowed as the person concerned did not fulfil the statutory contribution conditions for the scheme.  The person applied to the Scope section of the Department for a decision regarding the insurability of her employment on the family farm on the basis she was in a business partnership with her spouse in running the farm.  A Deciding Officer in Scope section decided that a partnership existed and Class S should be applied to income from this enterprise provided her total reckonable income was €3,174 or more in a year.  This ruling applied to the period 6 April 1988 to September 2010 when the person became 66 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">However, on checking the department's records it transpired that there had been no income from the farm between 1988 and 2001, all income declared by her spouse to Revenue was for fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">As a result of a further request as to whether a partnership existed in the fishing enterprise it was decided by Scope that a business partnership did not exist and that she was not insurable in this enterprise under the social welfare acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">This decision is now under appeal and because of the complexity of the issues involved the Appeals Officer has decided to hold an oral hearing in the matter.  It is hoped to arrange that hearing shortly and Appeals Office will be in touch with the person with regard to the arrangements as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 and 2011 when the intake rose to 32,432 and 31,241 respectively and these increases have impacted hugely on the processing times for appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers since between 2010 and 2011. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39. In addition to this, the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">As a result of these measures, the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions in the first quarter of 2012 was 22.4 weeks, and 40.9 weeks for those that required an oral hearing.  The comparable times for 2011 were 25 weeks and 52.5 weeks respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1489">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">Under the provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations, and the Wildlife Acts, compensation is payable in certain circumstances where existing activities must cease for the conservation of a protected site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">Bulrush, a large-scale commercial peat extraction company, had operations ongoing in Mouds Bog Special Area of Conservation and Nure Bog Natural Heritage Area, two sites nominated for the protection of raised bog habitat. Following proposals in 2002 to designate these sites as Special Areas of Conservation the company was compelled to cease turf-extraction activity within these sites and applied for compensation for the losses that it suffered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Following protracted negotiations a settlement was reached with Bulrush in December 2011. Under the terms of the settlement, my Department agreed to purchase the Bulrush landholdings in both sites (circa 350 acres) for €150,000. The sale of this land has not yet closed. Compensation amounting to €2.35m was paid for the losses arising from the requirement to cease commercial operations as part of this settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">The longer term management of the sites, including restoration, will require existing drainage arrangements, including those on Bulrush lands, to be examined and addressed. It is important that such action be undertaken with careful consideration and planning as it has the potential to impact significantly on surrounding lands. General issues in relation to raised bog restoration will be considered in the proposed national SAC raised bog management plan which my Department and the Peatlands Council will be preparing, as called for in the recent Dáil motion on SAC raised bogs. In this context my Department is committed to ensuring that restoration issues, including drainage, are considered in full consultation with local landowners and stakeholders to ensure the minimum of impact on surrounding landowners.</p>

The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible at this time to accept applications or approve funding of the nature referred to in his question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, together.  Last week the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a report of preliminary background research it had commissioned into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction.  This research study was carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  The EPA proposes to commission further, more extensive, research on hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and representatives from my Department and the EPA are developing the scope for this study, having regard to the findings of the University of Aberdeen study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">I do not believe that publishing a green or white paper now would be of benefit.  Instead I propose a way forward based on obtaining further and more detailed scientific advice, as is envisaged with the proposed second study to be commissioned by the EPA in the coming months.  Until the results of that study are available and have been considered, I will not make any decision on any application proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1562">Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The SEAI has contracts in place with 27 CBOs.  An Invitation to Tender was recently published by the SEAI to establish a new panel of private contractors to augment this network.  This is subject to EU tendering procedures and it is expected that the panel will be in place and operational in early June. Once these procedures are complied with I have requested the SEAI to be prepared to step up delivery in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">Exchequer funding of €17.148 million has been allocated for Better Energy: Warmer Homes in 2012.  Energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 1,228 homes under the scheme from the start of the year to 30 April amounting to €1.343 million in funding from the Exchequer.  Since commencement of the Programme Energy Efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 81,616 homes amounting to €82.773 million in Exchequer funding.  There are currently 10,032 homes on the waiting list and energy efficiency upgrades continue to be provided to households on the list on 31 March.  These applicant homes are being retrofitted according to their place on the waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">All new applicants since the end of 2011 have been informed that there will be a change in eligibility criteria.  The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority; such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.  Factors that will be taken into account in reviewing the eligibility criteria include the age of the home, the thermal efficiency of the home, the number and age of occupants, health considerations and household income.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.  The revised eligibility criteria have been agreed by the Inter Departmental Group on Affordable Energy and will be published shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1632">There are no plans to introduce a monthly instalment payment option for motor tax.  Half-year and quarterly rates of motor tax are at a higher rate than the annual fee to take account of the extra workload for motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and the resultant higher administrative and printing costs. In addition reminders are issued on each renewal.  Any proposal to introduce a monthly payment option would further increase the workload and costs for motor tax offices and the NVDF and the rates set for monthly vehicle licences would have to reflect that increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_1646">Group water schemes supplied from a public supply are generally charged in line with the non-domestic charges set by the relevant local authority.   Such group water schemes can opt to be taken-over by the local authority and funding is available under my Department's Rural Water Programme where investment is required in the infrastructure as part of such take-over.  As part of the proposed water sector reforms, it is envisaged that Irish Water would, following the eventual transfer of the relevant functions from local authorities in 2017, be responsible for the bulk provision of water to such schemes.  In the meantime, local authorities will continue to administer all group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">Group water schemes supplied from either a private source or a local authority public supply may qualify for a subsidy towards the operational costs of supplying domestic water in respect of each house connected to the scheme.   €21.7 million has been provided by my Department this year to cover the costs of the subsidy scheme, including the higher rate of subsidy referred to in the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">The future approaches to funding of the group water sector in relation to both capital and operational subsidies will be determined by my Department in due course, in consultation with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, taking account of the needs of the sector and the developments on the funding of public water schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">Section 19 (7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, as initially enacted, provided that election and referendum posters had to be removed within 7 days following the relevant polling date.  Through the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Act 2009, this provision was amended to also provide for a time limit prior to the polling date, during which election and referendum posters can be displayed.  It specifies that election posters may only be erected from the date of the Polling Day Order or 30 days prior to the date of the poll, whichever is the shorter period.  The time limit for referendum posters was not restricted to 30 days; such posters may be displayed from the date the Polling Day Order is signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Any election or referenda posters in place before or after the stipulated timeframe may be subject to an on-the-spot litter fine of €150. The responsibility for enforcement of this legislation is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">There are no specific requirements under the Litter Pollution Acts governing either the number, size, location or positioning of election posters. However, I understand that under section 95(14) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the erection of posters on directional signs and traffic light poles is an offence, if such posters obscure the visibility of the signs or obstruct the view of public road users so as to render the road dangerous to them.</p>

         the extent, if any, to which home owners whose property contains pyrite have been offered assistance through home bonds possibly enhanced by the insurance federation and or other interests involved in the construction of dwellings thus affected having particular regard to the need to re-establish confidence in the quality and durability of the construction sector and safeguarding the rights of the consumer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1677">I have no function and, consequently, no information in relation to the extent of assistance provided to purchasers of new homes by the companies providing structural guarantees warranties/insurance.  However, I understand that the companies have funded remediation works resulting from pyrite damage and one company continues to do so in line with the relevant insurance policy.   HomeBond, one of the companies involved, withdrew cover for such work in August 2011.  As I have previously stated, I am very disappointed with the stance adopted by HomeBond in withdrawing cover for pyrite related damage to homeowners and I communicated this to the company last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">I understand that a number of other insurance companies are also involved in funding pyrite related remediation works agreed through mediation or arbitration processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">I set up the independent Pyrite Panel in September 2011 with the remit of exploring options to address the pyrite problem and I hope to receive its report early next month.  I will give careful consideration to any recommendations it may contain in relation to providing mechanisms to address the pyrite problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  In July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">In broad terms the measures will involve:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1682">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1683">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1684">(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective oversight of building activity;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1685">(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1686">(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">I have recently released, for public consultation, proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which will provide for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings as referred to at (a) and (b) above.  The draft regulations and an explanatory document to inform the public consultation process are currently available on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.   The closing date for submissions in relation to the proposed regulations is 24 May 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The other measures referred to above are being advanced separately by local authorities in consultation with my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1904">I acknowledge that waiting times have increased since the downturn in the economy and that there has been a significant increase in demand for the Board's services.  However, the Board's grant-in-aid for general civil matters, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has effectively been maintained for 2012 at its 2011 level.  I have also now incorporated the grant for asylum services into the grant-in-aid which should give the Board greater flexibility in using its resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">I can also inform the Deputy that there are a number of other measures, taken or being taken, which I believe will have a positive impact on persons seeking services from the Board:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1906">The Board has outsourced to private solicitors significantly more work in recent years than it did a number of years ago.  There is of course a budgetary constraint on what can be referred and it is not possible to accommodate all of the additional demand through private referral;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1907">As of 1 November 2011, the Board assumed responsibility for the Family Mediation Service (following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011).  The Board is currently reviewing the operation of the State funded mediation service with a view to achieving synergies with its legal services and better options in terms of resolving family disputes;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1908">The arrangements on foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review.  There will be a level of restructuring of the current arrangements;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1909">The Board is working with individual law centres with a view to trying to deliver greater efficiencies in a number of its centres.  It is assisted in this regard by the preparation of a Value for Money Review Report prepared by my Department and the Department of Finance (now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform); and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1910">The Board has commenced piloting a "triage" service.  The objective of the pilot is to ensure that every applicant for services gets to see a solicitor for the purpose of getting early legal advice within a period of one month.  It is recognised that those seeking further services will experience a wait, however it is anticipated that an early consultation will benefit the client in terms of signposting actions the client can take themselves and signposting other support service.  The pilot has commenced in five of the Board's law centres — Sligo, Nenagh, Cavan, Wicklow and Athlone.  It is anticipated that the pilot will commence in the remaining centres shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1914">Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service. The delivery of judgments following completion of a court hearing is a matter for the judiciary who are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that all written reserved judgments made available by judges of the Supreme Court, High Court and Court of Criminal Appeal are published on their website <i>www.courts.ie</i>.  In general, Circuit and District Court judges do not deliver written judgments.  However, if a Circuit Court judge gives a written reserved judgment this is also published on the Courts Service website.  In relation to judgments against a debtor, the Courts Service has indicated that the primary source of judgment information is the Judgments Register maintained by the High Court and this Register is open for inspection on payment of the appropriate fee. There is no provision in law for a public register of judgments in debt cases brought before the Circuit or District courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">The Deputy may be aware of the Irish Sentencing Information System or "ISIS" which is a publicly accessible resource designed by the judiciary to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  I consider this website has the potential in time to be a valuable tool not only members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those of us concerned with the needs of victims and their families.  I understand that it is proposed to continue to develop this website subject to available resources and that it will be evaluated after it has been operating for some time.</p>

At that time I stated that the new Human Rights and Equality Commission will unequivocally keep faith with the UN Paris Principles on national human rights institutions.  As the Deputy has noted, the Working Group I established to advise me on practical issues in relation to the new body, including its powers and functions and issues in relation to the necessary establishing legislation, has now reported and its Report was published on 20 April 2012.  I am currently examining the recommendations made by the Working Group and will bring my proposals in relation to the various recommendations set out in the Report to Government shortly.  The Deputy will be able to judge for himself that my legislative proposals will most definitely deliver on my commitment that this merger will strengthen our institutional framework to strengthen human rights and equality when they are published.</p>

            <p eId="para_1950">In accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána Acts, proposals to alter the boundaries of a Garda Divisional geographical area are a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2012 contained the Commissioner's proposals to amalgamate the Garda Districts of Ashbourne and Laytown.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that these Garda Districts were merged on 30 April 2012.  There were no further boundary changes made within the Meath Garda Division and no other Districts were affected.  The Meath Garda Division currently comprises four Districts: Ashbourne, Kells, Navan and Trim.

            <p eId="para_1991">My Department keeps equal status and employment equality legislation under ongoing review.  Particular areas currently being progressed for review are set out as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">In a decision issued on 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice, having reviewed Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/113/EC which enables Member States to maintain an exemption from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits in insurance, determined that this provision of the Directive must  be considered to be invalid upon the expiry of an appropriate transitional period, which it set to end on 21 December 2012.  I will announce shortly the details of legislation to amendment to the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2011 to give effect to this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">The amalgamation of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority announced by the Government in October of last year will require legislation, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, amend the Equal Status and Employment Equality Acts.  I am currently examining the recommendations made by the Working Group I established to advise me on the practical implementation issues of this decision and will bring my proposals in relation to the various recommendations set out in the Report to Government shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">The Deputy may also recall my recent statement in the Seanad debate of 2 May on the Private Members' Bill to amend provisions of the Employment Equality Acts concerned with religious ethos in religious, educational and medical institutions.  I stated my intention to ask the new Human Rights and Equality Commission to consider the issues that arise in this area and to report on its views and recommendations to the Minister for Education and Skills and myself and to the House.  I gave a commitment, once the Commission had reported, to bring forward Government proposals in this area early in the New Year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">Finally, I draw the Deputy's attention to discussions which are ongoing at Council working group level on the proposal published on 7 July 2008 by the European Commission for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in the supply of and access to goods and services, social benefits including social security and health care, and education.  The text of the legislative proposal and an information note were provided to the Oireachtas on 5 August 2008.  As these discussions are ongoing, it is not yet possible to determine whether and when new EU legislation will emerge for transposition.  If and when a text is enacted by the European institutions, the Equal Status Acts will fall to be reviewed to determine whether amendments will be required to give effect to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_2052">Recruitment of Garda Reserve members is governed by the Garda Síochána (Reserve Members) Regulations 2006. Recruitment is a matter for the Public Appointments Service in the first instance and then the Garda Commissioner. I have no function in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are a total of 921 Garda Reserves of which there are 675 male and 246 female. There are a total of 77 Reserve members or trainees who are non-Irish nationals. The Notes for Candidates and Conditions of Service booklet detailing the selection of personnel, the grounds for refusing an application and the review procedure for the Garda Reserve is available to applicants on the public jobs web site, <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>. The appeal process may take two separate paths, an informal appeal involving the applicant and a person nominated by the Commissioner or a more formal approach where a review is carried out by a Decision Arbitrator appointed by the Commissioner. The results of these processes are confidential between the Commissioner and the applicant and statistics are not generally maintained.  A refusal for entry to the Garda Reserves does not preclude any future applications by that candidate providing the statutory requirements then pertaining are met by them.</p>

The primary role of the civil element of the Department is to support me as Head of the Department, in particular by providing policy advice and support on Defence matters. In support of this role my Department initiated an open tender competition for the provision of an externally hosted press cutting and media monitoring service on the 4th May 2012.  This service is required to support the timely, responsive and effective conduct of the business of the Department. The service will provide a press cutting and media monitoring service covering issues of direct relevance to my Department and on the key areas of the Defence organisation including the Defence Forces, Naval Service and the Air Corp. The cost of the provision of this service will be determined by the tender competition which is still active.</p>

Each Fishery Harbour Centre is regarded as the Local Competent Authority and is required to have a fee structure in place so that all ships calling to port are required to contribute significantly to the provision of port reception facilities in the port, whether any particular ship avails of facilities or not. This obligation to pay charges for disposal of waste ensures that waste is not dumped at sea in an effort to reduce harbour charges.</p>

Chuidigh an Scéim le soithigh iascaigh ceanglais rialála a chomhlíonadh agus cuireann ardchaighdeán sábháilteachta ar shoithigh iascaigh chun cinn.  D'fheidhmigh an Scéim de réir rialacha <i>de minimis</i>   na hearnála iascaigh (875/2007), faoina bhfuil díolúine aici ó ghnáthcheanglais fógra a bhaineann le Cúnamh Stáit.</p>

De réir Airteagal 25(2) den Rialachán EFF ní chuirtear tacaíocht ar fáil ach le "feabhas" a chur ar shábháilteacht flíteanna agus sin amháin.  Tá sé curtha in iúl ag an gCoimisiún Eorpach do mo Roinnse gurbh é a léirmhíniú air sin ná bearta lasmuigh de cheanglais rialála.  Níor aontaigh mise le tuairimí an Choimisiúin ach bhreithnigh dá mbeadh bearta ann nach mbeadh incháilithe do chomh-mhaoiniú EFF go bhféadfaí fós iad a mhaoiniúón Státchiste faoi rialacha <i>de minimis</i>.  Ag cruinniú den Choiste Monatóireachta ar an gClár Comh-Mhaoinithe an 12 Márta 2012 áfach chuir ionadaí an Choimisiúin in iúl seasamh an Choimisiúin nach raibh bearta sábháilteachta flíteanna atá riachtanach de réir an dlí san áireamh le cúnamh a fháil faoi <i>de minimis</i>.

Cé go bhfuiltear fós ag fanacht le freagra, chuir an Coimisiún in iúl ó shin ó bhéal, tar éis tuairimí na Roinne a iniúchadh, go bhfuil sé ag seasamh leis an méid nach féidir tacaíocht a thabhairt i bhfoirm cúnaimh dheontais lena n-áirítear faoi rialacha <i>de minimis </i>  i dtreo trealamh sábháilteachta éigeantach.  Tá sé curtha in iúl ag an gCoimisiún go gcuirfidh sé an méid seo in iúl go foirmeálta don Roinn go luath agus go leagfar amach an bunús dlí atá le léirmhíniú an Choimisiúin.</p>

            <p eId="para_2093">Total expenditure by the Department has reduced from €2.1 billion in 2008 to the Vote provision of €1.339 billion in 2012. The reductions in expenditure over the 4 year period are due to a range of factors including the natural expiry of schemes of fixed or limited duration or of limited funding, improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery and the reductions in expenditure which have been required in order to remain within the expenditure ceilings in the Government's Comprehensive Expenditure Report, 2012-2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">My objective is to ensure that the limited budgetary resources are targeted in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible obtain optimum benefit and that available funding is directed to priority schemes and services in accordance with Government policy.  My overall aim is to focus the available resources in favour of investment opportunities designed to advance the objectives outlined in Food Harvest 2020 and the Government's Programme for Recovery and on ensuring a future for farm families.</p>

            <p eId="para_2221">In respect of the Single Payment Scheme, the EU regulatory deductions in respect Modulation have increased, incrementally, from 5% under the 2008 Scheme to 10% under the 2012 Scheme. The marginal rate of modulation, levied on payments in excess of €300,000, increased pro rata, from 9% in 2008 to 14% in 2012. There are only 5 applicants that fit into the latter category in Ireland. As the Deputy is aware all SPS payments less than €5,000 are exempt from the modulation deduction as is the first €5,000 paid to all other farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">In relation to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, National budgetary considerations necessitated two reductions in the annual budget for this Scheme. The first was in respect of the 2009 Scheme-year, when the annual budget was reduced to €220 million, while the second is in respect of the 2012 scheme-year, with the annual budget reduced from €220 million to €190 million. While the savings in respect of the 2009 Scheme were achieved via the application of a general reduction in the maximum payable area, from 45 hectares to 34 hectares, the savings under the 2012 Scheme will be achieved via a series of technical adjustments to the Scheme's eligibility criteria, designed with the intention of giving better focus to the Scheme, which is to the benefit of the majority of those actively farming in areas with recognised constraints. Furthermore, every effort will be made to accommodate all active farmers who may find themselves otherwise adversely affected by the changes introduced for the 2012 Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">Given the changing pattern in individual farmer's farm size, area and category of Disadvantaged land held, it is not possible to accurately measure the impact of the changes, mentioned above, for individual farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">REPS 4 was launched in August 2007 as one of the measures in the CAP Rural Development Programme 2007-13. In 2009 because of the very large uptake and the consequent funding commitment involved, the original payment rates were cut by 17%.  At that stage 12,031 participants had already joined REPS and had been paid their 2007 and 2008 payments.  The rate cuts meant an average loss of income to these farmers of €1,075 per annum. REPS continued to grow in 2009 and 2010 and there are now a total of 30,400 active participants receiving an average annual payment of €6,200.  This €188 million annual payment to the farming community is vital to the fabric of our rural communities and this Department continues to support the REPS schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2226">In 2011 I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries. In response to my notification of the review, a number of proposals were received from industry, many offering conflicting views, particularly in regard to the need to ring fence the fisheries. Taking account of the views expressed I issued a draft policy for consultation in December 2011. Following this, in February of this year, I met with and consulted the industry on the matter. I have asked my Department to bring to a conclusion as soon as possible the analysis of the data and to bring forward options to integrate where possible the views of the industry with the draft policy already issued. I then intend to make a final decision on the management arrangements for the 2012 herring fisheries. Revised arrangements, if any, will be on the basis that they deliver a proper and effective management regime for the stock.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2245">I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 158 and 163 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">As I have explained in reply to recent Parliamentary Questions, the changes to the TB eradication programme which were introduced by my Department earlier this year are designed to improve the effectiveness of the programme by tightening up on overdue testing and preventing the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds. Thus, greater stress is being laid on ensuring all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds and export markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">I want to emphasise that these changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals. For example, research has shown that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the re-test and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test or at slaughter compared to all other animals in the herd. For this reason, my Department has decided to limit the movement of these higher risk individual animals from the herd of disclosure for the duration of their lifetime, except to slaughter or, in exceptional cases, to a feedlot.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">With regard to contiguous herds, the only change from previous arrangements is that contiguous herds are now being trade restricted, except to slaughter, pending a TB test. Previously, such herds were permitted to sell cattle on the open market prior to carrying out the test and research had shown that this posed a risk to clear herds. Any herd which tests clear will be immediately de-restricted. The trade restriction only applies to those herds which are identified, following an epidemiological investigation by my Department, as being relevant to the breakdown herd and which have not been tested in the previous 4 months. The four months period is not new or arbitrary but is related to the time interval from when an animal may be exposed to infection and the expectation that a test will give a positive result, if the animal is infected. An increase to 6 months would substantially weaken the measure in that a significant number of animals would be permitted to move from high risk herds without a test. Herd owners will be contacted by my Department prior to restriction and only those herds which, on a case by case consideration, are identified as genuinely relevant to the breakdown will be restricted. Furthermore, since the Department pays for contiguous tests within a 10 month timeframe, the new arrangements will not impose any additional testing costs on most farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">Regarding the financial impact on farmers, my Department, in introducing these changes, took account of the fact that any additional costs on those farmers on whom restrictions are imposed are more than offset by a reduction in costs on those farmers who are saved a breakdown as a result of the enhanced policy of confining disease to the holding where it is disclosed and imposing restrictions on high risk animals. In addition, it was conscious of the fundamental unfairness of permitting herdowners to sell potentially infected animals to other herdowners who were not aware of the increased risk attached to these animals. The reality is that a farmer who buys an inconclusive reactor or an untested animal from a contiguous herd will have his restricted for four months in the event that any of those animals test TB positive at the next test or at slaughter and his herd will be required to undergo a minimum of two clear tests. This has financial consequences both for the farmer and the Department in terms of restrictions on trade and additional testing costs. Those farmers whose herds are restricted because they are contiguous to a high risk breakdown can minimise any financial impact by arranging to have their herds tested as soon as possible. In the unfortunate event that reactors are disclosed in those herds, my Department provides a number of compensatory measures including compensation for animals removed as reactor, income supplement and hardship grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">While I am very pleased with the reduction in both the herd and animal incidence of TB in recent years, my Department subjects the TB eradication programme to on-going review with a view to ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place. The prevention of the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds is an important factor both in achieving the goal of eradication and in continuing to secure funding from the EU.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary in light of experience.</p>

            <p eId="para_2252">A voluntary phase of a national bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme commenced in January 2012. The programme is designed with an initial focus on identification and removal of persistently infected (PI) animals with particular emphasis on testing of calves for the BVD virus using tissue samples collected by ear punch. The programme will become compulsory in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">In compliance with the programme guidelines, particularly in relation to the non-sale of PI animals and the speedy disposal of infected animals, the Department is providing financial assistance by way of a one off €100 welfare payment for any suckler cow whose offspring is removed under the Programme and a €15 contribution towards the knackery cost of disposal of PI calves payable directly to the knackery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">Details regarding the €100 welfare payment are available from the Department's BVD Compensation Section in Portlaoise and details relating to the €15 calf subsidy are available from the Department's Fallen Animal Section in Wexford. Further details on the programme are available on the Department's website: <i>http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/ diseasecontrol/bovineviraldiarrhoeabvd</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agri-food sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and these are due to come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules. Teagasc have estimated that approximately 36% of pig units, housing some 44% of the sow population are presently compliant with the provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">My Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010. Grant-aid is available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of €300,000, i.e. a maximum grant of €120,000. A total of €13 million has been set aside under this scheme. It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 which made payments of €6.2 million to 63 applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">At present, more than 50 applications for grants worth approximately €4 million have been received under the current scheme. Applications must be accompanied by either full planning permission or a declaration of exemption from planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">The initial deadline for the receipt of applications has been extended from June to 31 October 2012 and DAFM has applied to the European Commission for permission to extend the deadline for completion of the work under the current programme to the end of September 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">My Department has met with producer representatives in order to discuss and manage this issue. In addition, it has contacted all local authorities in order to ascertain the number of planning applications made in respect of sow housing. In addition, my Department has written to all pig producers impacted by the new welfare requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">The approach being adopted in respect of loose sow housing mirrors that taken with regard to the introduction of the enriched cage egg production system in January of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">Through the efforts of industry operators, and with the assistance of my Department, Ireland was compliant with the new enriched cage system by the January deadline and an audit visit by the Food and Veterinary Office in early March confirmed this. A number of EU Member States have not yet complied with the provisions of the Directive and this has led to a decline in production and a short-term increase in the price of eggs in the EU market. In recent weeks European egg prices have stabilised as more producers achieve compliance. Prices in Ireland increased by a much lower level than elsewhere in the EU, due largely to our early compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2415">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is being reduced from €220 million to €190 million. In order to make the necessary savings it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2416">To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2417">To maintain the countryside;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2418">To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">Rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">While changes are being introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</p>

            <p eId="para_2424">The 2012 National Reserve, the closing date for which was 15 May, caters for new entrants to farming. In order to qualify for entitlements from the National Reserve applicants must have a herd number or have applied for a herd number prior to 15th May 2012, and have submitted an application under the 2012 Single payment scheme providing details of the number of eligible hectares farmed. Owned and leased/ rented land is eligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications. Off-farm income cannot exceed €30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed €40,000. Applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent. The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose.  The value of entitlements allocated to successful applicants will be the average value of entitlements in the District Electoral Division (DED) associated with the herd number of the applicant.  The maximum payment under the 2012 National Reserve is €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">The National Reserve is a scarce resource and is only replenished from entitlements that remain unused over a period of two consecutive years. Where the value of unused entitlements at the end of 2012 is insufficient to meet the requirements of all eligible applicants under the 2012 National Reserve, a linear cut will be applied to the allocation of successful applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">It is too early yet to say what, if any, provisions will be made under the 2013 National Reserve as this will depend on the funds available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">The European Commission published its proposals for reform of the CAP post 2013 in October last and negotiations on those proposals are continuing.  Under the proposals existing single payment entitlements will be abolished on 31 December 2013 and new entitlements will be allocated to eligible farmers in 2014.  As the negotiations are still at an early stage it is too soon to speculate on what the final outcome and details of the reform will be including the arrangements for new entrants to farming and the National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">I will continue to consult with farming organisations and other stakeholders as the negotiations progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_2434">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is implemented by my Department and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">During 2011, officials from my Department engaged in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process and scrutinised every area of expenditure as part of this process.  Under this review savings of some €16.5 million in current funding have been agreed for this Department for this year.  However, this figure reduces when account is taken of the fact that additional funding has been provided to meet demographic pressures arising under the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and to protect the universality of that programme.  The number of children eligible for the programme this year will increase by some 3,000, resulting in an expected rise of €10 million in the cost of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">While I am pleased that in line with the Programme for Government, the ECCE programme is to be maintained on a universal and free basis and that funding to meet the additional costs of the demographic changes has been provided for, it will be necessary to make some changes to the capitation payments in the school year commencing in September 2012, to meet the need to reduce overall expenditure.  A reduction of €2 per week will be made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to child care services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratios and the space ratios for the preschool element of child care services only, will be increased in September 2012.  The staff to child ratio will increase from a ratio of 1: 10 to a ratio of 1: 11. To allow for the implementation of these new ratios it is proposed that a new space/area requirement of 1.818 square metres per child will be applied.  The Water Closet/Wash Hand Basin ratios will also change in line with the adult/child ratios.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">To facilitate for the introduction of the ECCE programme a number of transitional measures were included when the programme commenced in January 2010.  One of these was the option of providing the free preschool provision over either a 38 week or 50 week school year.  As the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children and as it is considered that the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high quality early years experience is the 38 week model, the option of the 50 week model will no longer be available from September 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2442">I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 172, 176 and 177 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2443">The Adoption Act, 2010, which was commenced on 1st November 2010, coincided with Ireland's formal ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and inter-country adoption.  The Adoption Act, 2010, which provides the legislative framework for adoption in Ireland, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child and to the highest possible standard.  The phrase ‘in the best interests of the child' is absolutely key in this regard. It must not be forgotten that inter-country adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country. The interests of the child must always be paramount throughout the adoption process. This is best achieved through the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing adoption practice. This is the primary concern for the Adoption Authority of Ireland in conducting its business as it relates to inter-country adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2444">Adoptions from Russia, effected under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined, and recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State." Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">A delegation comprised of representatives of the Adoption Authority and officials from my Department held exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in December of last year. The delegation visited Russia in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on inter-country adoption.  This was a follow up to previous discussions which took place earlier in the year, on the initiative of the Russian authorities. I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard. I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so as soon as possible.</p>

Kazakhstan has ratified the Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">Over the past 18 months the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for inter-country adoption.  To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI. The Authority has continued to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of inter-country adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year. I understand that an official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow has now presented the copy correspondence to, and raised the issue of inter-country adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan.  I understand the Kazakhstani authorities hosted a meeting on inter-country adoption last Friday. I would like to point out that at no stage were the AAI, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Embassy contacted by the Kazakhstani authorities regarding the meeting. As soon as the issue came to the attention of my Department, official contact was made with the Embassy in Moscow in this regard. The Embassy officials in Moscow are endeavouring to secure feedback from this meeting to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on inter-country adoption between Ireland and Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">My officials are actively pursuing the matter in conjunction with the AAI.  The Embassy has been asked to request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In the interim the AAI is currently completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2452">Under the Hague Adoption Convention, countries seek to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the inter-country adoption process. The role of the Central Authority in each country is particularly key in overseeing standards within each jurisdiction and in facilitating collaboration between respective countries. The Adoption Authority of Ireland will continue to engage with its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan with a view to progressing potential collaboration in the best interests of children.</p>

            <p eId="para_2454">Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a "need for assistance" and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">At 18 years of age, all young people who are in care with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.

            <p eId="para_2456">The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training and social support. The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those that have dropped out of education and training and those that have left residential care. Some of these young people have mental health problems or a disability. Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young person's need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education in the months before their 18th birthday. The level of support required will vary for each individual.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2457">Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age. These young people continue in education and training as planned. This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which has been developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies involved in aftercare provision and my Department. The policy which was finalised in April 2011, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. The HSE has established an intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy and their work is ongoing. The implementation of the policy and the ongoing provision of aftercare services is being kept under review and I will continue to engage with the HSE on this matter over the course of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2462">The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. As with all Government departments and agencies, funding for the programmes of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been reduced in recent years due to the general budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.  In 2012 funding of some €56.806m is available to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  This includes support for a range of volunteer-led youth groups under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.  Funding of  €1.035m has been allocated to this scheme in my Department's budget for 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2525">Within the employment target set by Government, the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 allows for some targeted investment and recruitment in priority areas to address development priorities, such as in mental health and primary care. The Service Plan also allows some limited and targeted recruitment in critical service areas to help limit the impact of retirements on frontline services. However, given that the overall employment target must be met, these posts can only be put in place where this is possible within employment ceiling and budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to significantly reducing the expenditure on agency staff usage with a target reduction of up to 50%. The Plan also contains a commitment that overtime and agency staffing are not to be used to support service levels beyond those agreed in the Plan or to substitute for staff losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers and retirements, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system. Therefore, the HSE is using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services. It is also seeking to deliver greater productivity through the National Clinical Programmes to reduce the average length of stay, improve day of admission surgery rates, increase the number of patients treated as day cases, etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_2535">The effectiveness of medicines for the treatment of any illnesses including Multiple Sclerosis are assessed on a case by case basis and in regard to the benefits for each patient.  In relation to the specific example of Tysabri, the Summary of Product Characteristics for this product notes that treatment with Tysabri should be started and continuously supervised by a doctor who is experienced in treating diseases of the nervous system and has access to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. This machine enables the doctor to see inside the body to check for changes in the brain linked to MS or the rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tysabri is given as a one-hour infusion every four weeks. Because the infusion can trigger an allergic reaction, the patient must be monitored during the infusion and for one hour afterwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">Due to the nature of the treatment, it is necessary for the patient to be treated in a hospital setting.  This precludes the drug from being included within the GMS and community drugs schemes which provide for the reimbursement of medicines dispensed by community pharmacists.</p>
