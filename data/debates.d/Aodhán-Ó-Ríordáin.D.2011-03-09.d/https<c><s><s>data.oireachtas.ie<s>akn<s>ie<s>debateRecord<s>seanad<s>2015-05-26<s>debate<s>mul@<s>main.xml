          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Lorraine Higgins that, on the motion for the Commencement of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to provide an update on the progress of the proposed new school building for Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha in Tuam, County Galway. </p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator John Whelan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to address the delay in establishing a renewable heat incentive under the bioenergy strategy which is militating against biomass heating equipment and, therefore, counter-productive in terms of our renewable energy policy and investment and impeding the objective of meeting the 2020 national renewable energy action plan targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to publish acceptable wind turbine guidelines and ensure they will be applicable to projects before An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Health to outline how many speech and language therapist and clinical psychologist posts there are in the public system in Waterford city and county, how many are vacant, how many of the 80 posts announced last year were allocated to Waterford and how many of the additional 120 posts will be allocated to Waterford and to outline waiting times for an assessment for children referred with a mild to severe intellectual or physical disability and children with complex needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to give an assurance that the Government will continue funding the national deaf advocacy service of the Irish Deaf Society and the 26 other organisations which were subject to cuts in funding last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Lorraine Higgins, John Whelan, Thomas Byrne and David Cullinane and they will be taken now. Senator Mark Daly may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</p>

            <from>Senator Lorraine Higgins<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha in Tuam is seeking clarity on the matter of its proposed new school building. As far back as 2012 the school community was assured that a new school building would be delivered, as promised, in 2015. However, I am advised that there is no sign of this happening. Instead, according to the most recent updates from the Department, the project has not yet passed the site acquisition stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The protracted process and the lack of clarity for the school is deeply frustrating for students, management and teachers. A number of children are being taught in substandard temporary accommodation that has been in place for almost 20 years, which is wrong. The pupils and teachers of Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha need more than simply being put on the long finger; they need a new school building and the Department of Education and Skills has committed to providing it this year. They need to know now with absolute certainty and clarity when work on a new building will commence and how soon the school will be operational so that the children can at last be taught in a fit-for-purpose environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I stand with the pupils, teachers, parents and management of Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha in urging the Minister of State in the strongest possible terms to bring clarity to this situation and progress this long-standing issue for the students and teachers. I look forward to his response.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I thank the Senator for raising this issue which gives me the opportunity to clarify the position and report progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The five-year construction plan announced in March 2012 outlines the major school projects which will commence construction over the duration of the plan. A project in respect of Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha has been included in the plan and is scheduled to proceed to construction in 2015-16. I can advise that officials from my Department have been working closely with Galway County Council officials with regard to securing a suitable site to facilitate the delivery of permanent school accommodation for Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha in Tuam. A suitable site has been identified and the site acquisition process is at an advanced stage. However, during the conveyancing process issues outside the control of the Department have emerged which need to be addressed as part of due diligence in order for the conveyancing process to be satisfactorily completed. As the site acquisition is at conveyancing stage with legal issues being progressed and due to commercial sensitivities it would not be appropriate to provide further information at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Once the acquisition of the site is finalised this will enable the building project for the Gaelscoil to be progressed towards the construction stage. Under the Department's rapid design and build programme, the tender process for a building contractor has been running in parallel with the site acquisition process. The appointment of the contractor will be concluded when the site acquisition process is complete. </p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The officials from my Department are aware of the pressing need to acquire the site in order to facilitate the provision of a new school building. In that regard, every effort is being made to advance the process to allow the project proceed to construction as soon as possible. I thank the Senator for raising the matter and hope this reply outlines the current position. I offer apologies from my senior colleague who is in Boston.</p>

            <from>Senator Lorraine Higgins<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I appreciate the Minister of State's response, but it is a non-response. It has not shed any light on the question I raised. There is an urgent need to expedite the building of the school and the site acquisition in the first place. I ask that the Department deal assiduously with the issues raised. It is very important for it to consider a timeline for delivery of a school building and, first and foremost as a matter of urgency, for the acquisition of a site. I would appreciate a response from the Department in this regard as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I wish to clarify that the Department's officials recognise the urgency of the situation and are doing all in their power to resolve it. The issues which arose are outside the control of the Department and are within its gift to resolve. However, it is endeavouring to resolve them. They arose at a late stage of the conveyancing process. It is a legal matter which will have to be resolved. The Department wants to expedite the resolution of the issue and is working very hard in that regard. I hope we will see light very soon. The process will progress very fast thereafter.</p>

          <heading>Bioenergy Strategy Implementation<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:40:00+01:00"/></heading>
          <speech by="#JohnWhelan" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Senator John Whelan<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White. As line Minister with responsibility for this important policy area, I look forward to his response. I have expressed the view on more than one occasion that the bioenergy sector has been the poor relation or Cinderella of the broad renewable energy industry. There is an apparent disregard at Department level and within the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for the role bioenergy can play in achieving our renewable energy targets, displacing CO2 emissions, reducing imports of fossil fuels and creating jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> For two years, the Department dragged its heels on publishing a bioenergy policy perspective. While I am glad it has finally been produced, the delay has led to certain problems, particularly with regard to the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI. It is important for the industry to know what supports will be provided and the infrastructure around the transfer from fossil fuels, namely, oil and gas, to renewables, including biomass and bioenergy. However, the start-up date for the scheme is given as some time in 2016. This uncertainty and delay has had the unforeseen consequence of impeding and stalling the sector and bringing about a chilling effect. I could refer to numerous large-scale projects that were cancelled, put on hold or are in limbo because the developers are not willing to proceed without knowing at what stage the RHI will be implemented and what terms and criteria will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> It is in the Minister's gift to address this issue and bring some clarity to the situation, either by bringing forward the date of implementation, actually fixing an implementation date or, even at this juncture, outlining the criteria and standards that will apply when the scheme is introduced. That would enable people to proceed with investment and advance planning for such developments. The current uncertainty is having a negative impact on the sector and obstructing job creation in rural areas and within the regions. The bioenergy sector has a large contribution to make. In fact, an as yet unpublished SEAI report indicates there are 5,000 sustainable jobs to be created in the sector if it is given its head and the opportunity to grow and prosper. Unfortunately, many of the relevant companies have relocated to the United Kingdom, which is light years ahead of us on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> We must take a more vigorous and committed approach to the sector. We need, in the first instance, a domestic equivalent to the RHI scheme in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Why should we be subsidising oil and gas furnaces through the Better Homes scheme when we should be subsidising bioenergy? As the Minister knows, once families install boilers and heating systems, there is a 20-year commitment over a system's lifetime to importing oil and gas. This is counterproductive to the Government's objective of reaching our 2020 renewable targets, making our contribution towards addressing climate change, removing carbon from the system and creating sustainable jobs instead of importing fossil fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> As the Minister is aware, the commitment in the policy is to replace 200,000 tonnes of oil per year by 2020. It would be a major boon to the economy if we were to do so via investing in bioenergy systems. Will the Minister intervene in this matter? It is within his gift. Were clarity brought to the situation, it would help. This has the added benefit of helping the Minister to achieve his objectives as regards the 2020 targets on renewable energy and so on.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Alex White)<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:45:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_28">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and welcome the opportunity to address Senators on the topic.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> The Senator referred to Ireland's national renewable energy action plan, NREAP, which states that we aim to meet our overall 16% renewable energy target by 2020 by achieving 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, as well as 10% in transport and 12% in heating. I agree that energy from biomass has a critical role in meeting these ambitions for 2020 and beyond. It may interest the Senator and colleagues to know that provisional figures for 2014 show that biomass accounted for 3.6 percentage points of the 8.6 percentage points delivered by renewables, representing something in the order of 40%, which is not insignificant.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Recognising the potential to develop the bioenergy sector significantly and to address the challenges involved, I published a draft bioenergy plan last October. Analysis underpinning the draft plan demonstrates that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heating sector would represent the most cost-effective means of meeting a number of our policy goals. It is, therefore, my intention, subject to further Government approval and state aid clearance, to introduce a renewable heat incentive, RHI, in 2016. This would encourage larger heat users to change to systems that produce heat from renewable sources. The scheme is being designed to increase the amount of heat generated from renewable sources, including biomass.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> There has been no delay in developing the scheme. Work is under way on developing its terms and conditions, the criteria and so on to which the Senator referred, including those relating to support tariffs and eligible technologies. These must be designed appropriately in order to ensure the objectives of the scheme are met cost-effectively. It is important that the scheme provide maximum value for money and minimise cost to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The first of three public consultations which are required to be held during the development of the RHI will commence shortly. In the meantime, my officials are considering the best ways of supporting continued investment in renewable heating solutions.</p>

            <from>Senator John Whelan<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:45:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">I thank the Minister for his answer. I appreciate that the RHI must be structured and work properly, but we are not trying to reinvent the wheel. Such schemes already operate in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Knigdom. We are playing catch-up. I urge the Minister to put in place interim arrangements such as the triple E register standard, which is already in operation and approved by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to ensure that people do not need to wait until 2016 before they can start the process of planning and seeking finance to prepare for such installations. As the Minister stated, many commercial and industrial operators would gladly embrace this technology, which is of considerable benefit in terms of job creation. We could embark on exemplar projects that would need to spend a great deal of time in the pipeline such as district heating systems for clusters of buildings, hospitals, prisons and schools in Portlaoise. Bringing forward the date or improving clarity would be helpful in terms of import substitution, our CO2 targets and job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I reassure the Senator that the scheme will be introduced as soon as possible. We must put together relatively complex elements of a new scheme in terms of how to incentivise and how to fund it.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">We have to apply for state aid approval in respect of many of these types of measures, as the Senator will be aware, but there has been no delay in bringing the scheme forward. I appreciate his enthusiasm for this sector, to which he has referred in the House previously. He is right and it is up to me to ensure the scheme is brought forward as soon as possible. That is what I will do but it will be 2016 before we can implement the scheme we intend putting in place. I understand and have sympathy with the Senator's frustration on giving an advance indication of what the criteria will be. However, the criteria constitute the scheme. We are not in a position to introduce a scheme gradually. We must ensure it is done properly and that there is proper consultation on it. The Senator and the House should be assured that there will no inordinate delay in bringing forward this important scheme, to which I, in particular, am committed.</p>

          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_11">
            <from>Senator Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_36">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit ach bhí mé ag súil leis an Aire, an Teachta Ó Ceallaigh. I was hoping the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be in attendance, but the Minister of State is attached to the Department, which is fair enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> This is an important issue in respect of the guidelines with which An Bord Pleanála will have to comply in making decisions on planning applications for wind turbine developments, an issue which I have raised in the House previously. There has been an inordinate delay in revising the 2006 guidelines, which are out of date. Draft guidelines were published at the end of 2013 and little has happened since. I am sure work has been going on but it is a year and a half since the then Minister published draft guidelines, which were unacceptable, and there was a public consultation process after that. Little has happened with the exception of two applications being made to the board relating to north Meath. One is on appeal from the county council for a small development of large turbines near Nobber while the other application is by the Element power company for a massive development across north Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> What will be included in the guidelines? RTE radio knew the other day and it had a good wind of what was happening. It is important that Parliament should know before a leak to RTE to try to help the Government parties and the Labour Party, in particular. We need to know whether the guidelines will be acceptable to local communities. What I hear about 700 m will not be acceptable and there are other issues surrounding the guidelines. What is the position on applications currently before An Bord Pleanála? Should the developers not withdraw them, presumably to comply with the revised guidelines, or is it the case that the old guidelines will continue to apply? No one will give a straight answer on this. One Fine Gael Deputy in Meath East says they will not apply while another Fine Gael Deputy says they will. The people deserve to know exactly what is going on in this regard because there should be fairness in planning. People should know what rules will apply. Will the Minister change the rules in the middle of the game to suit residents or will he leave the guidelines as they are to suit developers? That is the choice the Government has to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> The 2006 guidelines are out of date and there has been criticism that Fianna Fáil should have revised them previously, but the reality is the turbines proposed for north Meath were not available during the lifetime of the previous Government. They are brand new and it is about time the Government reacted properly to them. We need to know. There will be an oral hearing in Kells on 16 June. Anyone who will speak at the hearing will have to know what are the relevant planning guidelines. There is a planning application for another project before An Bord Pleanála, which is probably nearing decision. We need to know and there needs to be fairness. It is not good enough to say they will be published shortly because I have heard that at least twice during Commencement debates. We need to know the exact facts.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Ann Phelan)<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_40">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authorities, with a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. In the case of wind development proposals which meet the statutory threshold criteria for classification as strategic infrastructure developments under the Planning and Development Acts, applications must be submitted directly to An Bord Pleanála. Planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, are required to have regard to my Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006, in making determinations on wind farm development proposals. These guidelines provide advice for planning authorities on catering for wind energy through their development plans and the development management process. The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy developments and the treatment of planning applications relating to such developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> As the Senator noted, in December 2013 my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow-flicker aspects of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines. These draft revisions proposed the setting of a more stringent day-and-night noise limit of 40 decibels for future energy developments, a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling - for amenity considerations - and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the guidelines and this ran until 21 February 2014. My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 wind energy development guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account must be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation process in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the wind guidelines. The revisions to the wind energy development guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. In the interim, the 2006 guidelines will continue to apply to existing planning applications, including those currently with An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination in respect of a planning application or appeal, having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by my Department. However, as indicated, these guidelines are issued for guidance purposes to assist planning authorities in the performance of their functions. Ultimately, it falls to planning authorities - be they the local planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála - to decide on individual applications based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">There is no question but that the Minister of State's reply is extremely disappointing. We have moved on from a nod and a wink being given to wind farm developers to it being stated absolutely explicitly that the existing guidelines apply to those applications which are with An Bord Pleanála. This will come as a shock to some Fine Gael Deputies who earlier today informed us that the new guidelines would apply. It will certainly be a source of extreme annoyance to members of the public in north Meath that the cards are stacked against them, particularly because the guidelines to which the Minister of State refers really have no relevance regarding the kind of super-turbine it is proposed to build there. All planning existing applications should be the subject of a moratorium until the new guidelines are brought forward. When the guidelines emerge, we can then put in place a proper planning process. What is happening is completely improper.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">My knowledge of the planning process is that whatever is introduced does not apply retrospectively. If, therefore, a new guideline were to be introduced today, it would not apply to planning applications made previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">I also suggest to the Senator that if he seeks a moratorium on it, perhaps he needs to speak to the local authorities because, as indicated in the response and as the Minister has outlined, he is only issuing guidelines and that is what they are, namely, guidelines. It is up to the planning authority or, in this case, the local authority, or An Bord Pleanála, to adjudicate on individual planning applications. To my knowledge, this has always been the case.</p>

            <from>Senator David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_48">I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome the Minister of State. I tabled this Commencement motion last week and coincidentally, there was a report on Newstalk this morning by Kieran Cuddihy, who obtained figures through a freedom of information request regarding national waiting times for children with mild to profound intellectual or physical difficulties who were waiting for assessment. They show that 12,650 children nationally are waiting for assessments, of whom 3,300 are waiting for longer than the three months that is the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Government's own benchmark. As for children waiting for treatment, 4,500 are waiting for longer than three months, while 7,908 are waiting for treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> I am dealing with a number of families and wish to give the Minister of State a flavour of their stories, because each individual case has its own personal story to it. These are parents who are battling to get services for their child who may suffer from a mild to a severe disability, be it intellectual or physical. One such story concerned a child called Harvey, whose general practitioner, GP, referred him to the early intervention team in September 2013. On 19 September 2013, the parents received a letter from the speech and language therapist regarding the referrals with a questionnaire attached. On 29 November 2013, Harvey was assessed by the speech and language therapist and the conclusion in her report pertaining to autism stated Harvey was demonstrating some clinically significant markers for autism, that this would be monitored in subsequent sessions and onward referral would be made to the autism team, as required, and with parental consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The occupational therapist's report which was based on an assessment carried out on 11 March and 14 April 2014 again referred Harvey on to the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, team for a diagnostic assessment. The family was told this would happen in February or March 2014 but that date came and went. It is now approaching June 2015 and the family still awaits that diagnostic assessment. It had a private assessment carried out, which is accepted by the Department of Education and Skills but not by the HSE, which is the provider of the child services. I have to hand another e-mail from other parents stating their child did not get proper support due to a significant delay in diagnosing and assessing their child. Their son has ASD and received a private diagnosis when he was two years old. While he receives appropriate resources in school, he is almost seven and the HSE only diagnosed him this year after a long road and battle.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> As Members are aware, early intervention is hugely important and these children have complex needs and need multiple therapies. The question I specifically asked the Minister of State, because this is also relevant to where I come from in Waterford and is a national issue now that it has been highlighted, is how many speech, language and occupational therapists are in the public system in County Waterford. How long are children with mild to profound intellectual or physical disabilities in Waterford city and county waiting to be assessed? There appears to be a problem with assessment waiting times and these are stories from parents of children who do not deserve to be obliged to battle the State to get support for their children. They simply do not deserve that, as the resources should be provided as quickly as possible and under the timeframes to which the Government has committed. Consequently, I raise these issues on their behalf as they have asked me to so do.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Last year, 80 speech and language therapy posts were announced, not all of which were filled and none of which went to Waterford. As another 120 further posts are to be announced, how many of those posts will be delivered in Waterford? It is not just therapists as there also is a need for both child psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as this is a joined-up system.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The final point I will make is I visited the Sacred Heart Centre in Waterford city, where the staff provide fantastic support. It is a joint venture between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE, but the building is dilapidated.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">The children have complex needs and the building is not fit for purpose. There is a real need for resources to be put into this area. Unfortunately, due to waiting times and the lack of therapists, staff and capacity in the system, children are waiting longer than they should. The children in question have complex needs and we should not fail them. We should provide parents with every possible support because, as the Minister of State and I are well aware, early intervention is critical.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I agree with most of what the Senator said, but it is important to read his exact question, because what he said in his contribution is not exactly what he asked in writing, so I do not have the entire answer to the issues raised. The Senator inquired about</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_56">the need for the Minister for Health to outline how many speech and language therapist and clinical psychologist posts exist in the public system in Waterford city and county, how many are vacant, how many of the 80 posts announced last year were allocated to Waterford and how many of the additional 120 posts will be allocated to Waterford and to outline waiting times for assessment for children referred with a mild to severe intellectual or physical disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">There is no reference to the other areas of psychology to which he referred in his contribution. That is by way of explanation, because I do not wish the Senator to say subsequently that I did not answer the entire question.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> I thank the Senator for raising the issue. The Government is committed to the development of therapy services for children with a disability, including speech and language therapy and psychology services. Health-related therapy supports and interventions for children with a disability can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need. Speech and language therapy services in Waterford are provided by HSE teams in primary care and disability services, as well as by the Brothers of Charity and the Central Remedial Clinic regional service. There are 15 approved speech and language therapists, or 14.81 in whole-time equivalent terms, in the Waterford service overall. Six speech and language therapists provide services to the general population of children in primary care. Five speech and language therapists are assigned to the children's specialist disability services in Waterford. The remainder look after adults, mental health and other needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> In addition to these dedicated posts in Waterford, the Central Remedial Clinic regional service provides more specialised speech therapy for particular children with physical and sensory disability across the whole south-east region. I understand three of the 15 speech and language posts are vacant in Waterford. The filling of a permanent replacement post has been approved and a new post holder is due to take up duty next month. The local HSE community health organisation management in Waterford has prioritised the filling of the other two posts which are temporarily vacant due to maternity leave. I understand, however, it has proved difficult to secure appropriately qualified staff to take up these temporary positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> I also understand there are three psychologists employed in Waterford disability services. In addition, a number of psychologists are employed in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and in primary care services in Waterford. The HSE has advised that 13 assessment of need applications under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 were received in Waterford for the first quarter of 2015. A total of 12 of those were commenced within the statutory timeframe. A total of 22 applications, which have been on hand for over six months, are overdue for completion in Waterford. On this point, I stress that while any delay in the assessment of a child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any interventions deemed necessary, and guidance to this effect has been issued to front-line staff. I would be interested to hear from Senator Cullinane whether that is happening. I will explain the situation in a little more detail later. Importantly, the HSE has commenced the reconfiguration of children's disability services into geographically based children's disability network teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme. The objective of the programme is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children from zero to 18 years old, irrespective of the nature of their disability or where they live or attend school. The transition to this service delivery model is governed by a consultation and engagement process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> A number of HSE community health care organisations are successfully implementing this programme which requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools and local communities. It also involves implementing new policies, procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multi-agency working. Once this preparatory work has been completed, additional posts will be provided to support the implementation of the new model of service. Waterford, which has been working with the other counties in the local HSE community health organisation area, has put in place the required governance structure to allow for the provision of additional posts in 2015. Additional funding of €4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2015, equating to €6 million in a full year. In all, 120 new therapy posts will be provided across the country in 2015 and work on finalising the specific allocation of these posts is nearing completion. The HSE has informed me that, in this context, Waterford and the south east are being prioritised for therapy posts in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> I will explain the reason for the parallel operation of services that sometimes occurs. Strict compliance with the law would require a diagnosis before an intervention may take place. It has been made clear to front-line staff - I have stated this several times in this Chamber and elsewhere - that intervention at an early age should not be delayed because a diagnosis has not yet been provided. When a child has a difficulty with speech, it should not be necessary to wait for a diagnosis before speech therapy services are provided. Similarly, physiotherapy services should be provided to a child who lacks balance or cannot sit up. I could rattle off a list of difficulties children may experience but it is not necessary to do so. The necessary interventions should not hinge on the provision of a diagnosis, as occurred in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> The progressing disabilities programme for children aged from birth to 18 years has been rolled out in several areas. It is an incredible programme which does exactly what I have described. For example, children are not required to be signed up for a specific service or visit a particular service provider and intervention takes place in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> Once the 120 posts in this year's allocation have been provided, we will identify gaps in services and assess what further supports are needed to fill these gaps. We have already done this in the area of mental health. While no one denies that we are still far from where we should be, we should be able to do things better and in a more smooth manner. The progressing disabilities programme is the way forward in this regard. I fully agree with the approach of ensuring governance is in place before assessing which areas have the greatest need. In that context, Waterford has been prioritised.</p>

            <from>Senator David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_65">I welcome the Minister of State's response and the decision to prioritise Waterford city and county once the 120 new posts have been delivered. I am concerned, however, that 22 applications have been in hand for more than six months and their completion is long overdue. Perhaps some of the cases I cited are among this group of 22. I will forward to the Minister of State e-mails I have received asking questions and expressing concern as they provide evidence of the heartbreaking struggle of parents. They would also allow her to make up her mind as to whether children are receiving the treatment they need while assessments are ongoing. From my contact with parents, including e-mails I have received, it is clear that this is not always the case on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> I do not wish to make a political football of this issue. My only objective is to ensure the necessary capacity and posts are in place and the children in question receive the supports they need. When people contact me to tell me these types of story, I have a duty, as a public representative, to raise the issues directly with the relevant Minister. </p>
            <p eId="para_67"> I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the case of the centre in Lady Lane, Waterford, which provides a fantastic service for children. My view, which is shared by many parents, is that the building in which the service is located is not fit for purpose and a new, state-of-the-art facility is required. I am informed that children receive early intervention and support until the age of six years, at which point they lose their supports. An holistic review of services is required and the centre in Waterford should be replaced with a state-of-the-art facility to ensure children have all the resources they need in the best possible setting.</p>

The progressing disability services programme is genuinely for people aged 0 to 18 years, but if it does not have proper governance, it could go the way of all others. That is why we are insisting that the type of preparatory work necessary to make sure it works should be done. I believe that is the position in Waterford, which is why we will move on in terms of prioritisation. If the Senator wants to send me the information, I will consider it.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">I thank the Deputy Leader for outlining the Order of Business. The Order of Business gives me an opportunity, on behalf of my party, to very much welcome the result of the marriage equality referendum, not the presidential age referendum. The participation in the referendum by way of turnout was very heartening and shows that when civil groups, in particular, are at the centre of campaigns such as this, people become engaged. It was heartening to see the response of the "Yes" vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> It gives me great pleasure to commend, in particular, Senator David Norris. I am sure people will not mind me singling him out, as someone who has championed the cause of equal rights to same-sex marriage dating back to when homosexuality was a criminal offence. It makes ones think how quickly the country has moved on in relative terms. I also commend Senators Katherine Zappone, Ivana Bacik and many others who played their part in having the same-sex marriage referendum passed by the people. There is a slight degree of irony in that although we passed this referendum, we had a small break-up in the Fianna Fáil Party, but we are over it already and have moved on.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">Senator Averil Power played a very important and very active role in the campaign and I would never take that away from her; she is a very good colleague of ours; therefore, that is for another day. It is important for the occasion to be marked and I also welcome the fact that the Government has decided to bring the legislation forward to July. The Government can be assured of our party's support in ensuring the legislation has a quick passage. </p>
          <p eId="para_75"> I have just come from the Lower House and congratulate Bobby Aylward, the new Deputy who was elected for the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency to replace the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan. I am delighted he has been elected by the people of that constituency. He is a colleague of mine in Fianna Fáil and I pass on my congratulations to him and all candidates, of all parties and none, who put their names forward in the by-election and campaigned so hard in that constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> I believe that, earlier today, the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG was discussed in Cabinet. Our views are very clear on this - we oppose the sale of the State's share. Under the Aer Lingus Act 2004, once the Government makes a recommendation to sell its stake it has to be voted on in the Dáil. I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to the House at the appropriate time, whatever the Government decision is, to go through the rationale for the decision and take questions. I remind Members that 15,000 pensioners and members of the IASS pension scheme are suffering savage cuts to their pension benefits, which allowed Aer Lingus and the airport to wipe away a €740 million pension deficit in order to fatten the company up for sale. Those people must be remembered in this and perhaps, if the Government is going to sell its stake, part of the residual moneys can actually be used for the benefit of the deferred pensioners who have been cut by 60% and the retired members who are represented by RASA and who have lost six weeks pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_80"> This is a very important day for another reason. Today saw the publication of the report of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on farm safety. It is a tremendous and very useful report and I congratulate the Chairman of the committee, Senator Denis O'Donovan, and its rapporteur, Senator Martin Conway, for all the work they put into it. I also hope the rest of us assisted somewhat. It makes recommendations on the education front, in terms of awareness of new technologies, on targeted agricultural modernisation and a scheme for tractor safety and we know how important that is. It also deals with farm safety visits, a tractor adaptation grant which we have recommended, assistance for bereaved families and a scrappage scheme. Of particular importance in this area are PTO shafts, the dangers they present and the number of bereavements for which they are responsible. I lost a great friend in Ballyhar when a tractor pinned him down for 24 hours and he died a short time after being found in the cold of winter. I do hope the Minister and his departmental officials take serious note of everything that is in this report. It will be sent to them now and I look forward to the Leader giving a commitment to a debate on the report, for which the Chairman of the committee asked. The report is most useful and I heartily recommend it.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">It was an honour and a privilege to be present in Dublin Castle for the final declaration on Saturday and to see the landslide in the marriage equality referendum. I was in the count centre in the RDS early on Saturday morning and, while it became apparent from the first batch of boxes that we were heading for a resounding victory, the sense of occasion only grew in momentum as the day wore on.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I have known very few such days in my lifetime. I had the lyrics of Nina Simone's 1965 classic - "It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, and I'm feeling good" - going around my head for that entire weekend. Everybody one met around Dublin Castle and Dublin in general did. The result is more than what it says on the tin. It is a definitive reflection of a societal shift that has been developing for some time. The people have spoken and they are saying, "Welcome to 21st-century Ireland, which is open, inclusive, fair and tolerant." I congratulate Yes Equality and all the civil society groups that advocated, campaigned and canvassed to bring about the referendum and to bring about the courage in the Irish people to say "Yes." As a children's rights advocate, I was involved and was delighted to be part of a rallying call at the official launch of the BeLonGTo campaign, the largest coalition of children's and youth organisations supporting a "Yes" vote in the referendum. Well done to them on all their work. That organisation will need support as more and more young people are now having the courage to come forward. I hope we will arrive at a day when we do not need courage. On the issue of courage, I thank my colleague, Senator Katherine Zappone who had the courage to take the Government to the Supreme Court and Senator David Norris, who had and continues to have courage on the issue of ensuring equality. Particular mention should be made in this House of Senators Averil Power and Ivana Bacik who played a very strong role. Well done to all of us who played our individual parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I raise the issue of direct provision and the increase in the momentum for change. On 7 May, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions produced a report stating the direct provision system must be made subject to the Ombudsman for Children and the Freedom of Information Acts. On 22 May, the Ombudsman for Children's report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which will be looked at the week after next, raised specific concerns about mental health services for children in direct provision. Yesterday, HIQA published the report of its inspection of child protection and welfare services for children living in direct provision centres. We heard very startling reports. Today, at the ISPCC inaugural lecture, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, talked about the cultural norm we must have of protecting all children. We have, in a way, accepted that these children are treated differently. In this era of equality, we need to say it is no longer good enough. Given this focus on direct provision - I know we have a cross-party group and our group of nominees has put forward many motions on the issue - I ask the Leader to seek a commitment from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, to introduce the working group report on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, into the Seanad for debate, given our cross-party work on this issue. We have to have it soon and must take urgent action. There are children at risk in direct provision accommodation in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I join in the congratulations to everyone who was in Dublin Castle on Saturday and, in particular, our great colleague, Senator David Norris.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> For some of us, this is a sad day. The Government has presided over the sale of the Irish national airline without reference to the Oireachtas transport committee. They did not even have to give the Taoiseach the papers when he went into the Cabinet meeting this morning. My office was told by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport yesterday that it was not on the Cabinet agenda. This is an appalling way to proceed. We need that national airline. The conduct of British Airways shows contempt for this House, for this Parliament, for an independent country. It has gone to a British quango, the Competition and Markets Authority, to force Ryanair to divest its shares in Aer Lingus in order that British Airways can take it over.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> This is an outer offshore island that needs to access transport. This is an outer offshore island from which Aer Lingus has developed nine transatlantic routes. There are none from Scotland, which was a major factor in the rise of the Scottish National Party in recent elections. Angus MacNeil, the transport spokesman, said British Airways neglects Scotland. It has no routes to North America. We are trying to develop this country, yet we are handing over the national airline to an airline whose track record is not to provide services from Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham or any other region of the United Kingdom to North America. We need that North American investment. I am calling for the suspension of Standing Orders to make the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, come to the House and say what he is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I remind the Minister that two thirds of the people surveyed in <i>The Irish Times</i> Ipsos MRBI poll opposed the privatisation of that share of Aer Lingus, including a majority of the supporters of the Fine Gael Party and a strong majority of the supporters of the Labour Party, Sinn Féin, the Independents and Fianna Fáil. Why is a 21% share in an airline which we, the citizens, owned being given away for a paltry sum by the Cabinet today? Apparently it has adjourned and intends to meet again in the evening to complete this foul deed, which is not to the advantage of the country. It is anti-competition, anti-consumer and anti-development. We should suspend Standing Orders to force the Minister to come to the House because we, as Members of the Parliament, have not been supplied with the documentation. It also has not been given to the transport committee and it appears from the Taoiseach's interview this morning that he was not given the papers either. This is a shoddy way for British Airways to proceed with its business and it should not be tolerated by this independent country.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I also welcome the outcome of the marriage referendum. It was very heartening to see the cross-party support for it and everybody campaigning together. Tomorrow they will be protesting again but for that period of time everybody acted as one. Some campaigned more than others, but that is grand because that is democracy and everybody is entitled to their beliefs. The outcome was good. I especially congratulate those who are not involved in politics but who went out knocking on doors and to campaign for Yes Equality. Perhaps it will give them a taste of politics and they will continue in that line.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> I mention the provision of funding for the schemes to support national organisations, SSNOs. This is something on which Senator Jillian van Turnhout and I have been working. It was also the subject of a Commencement debate in the House. The Minister and the departmental officials met Senator Jillian van Turnhout and I to try to move this forward. Last night I was delighted to hear that the Minister had announced funding of €1.3 million to provide security for at least 12 months. However, these organisations should be put on a more sustainable footing. The Department of Health must move into this area and take over the disability and health organisations that should come within its remit. It should put proper funding in place for them to give them security, rather than have them not knowing whether they will be in their jobs in a year's time or whether they will be able to provide a service. Perhaps the Deputy Leader might invite the Minister for Health to the House in order that we could discuss it in detail. Otherwise, this issue will be before the House again this time next year. Some of us might be back here again too, although some of us might not, and we will be seeking funding again for these organisations for the future. Now is the time to act and put it on a more sustainable footing before then.</p>

          <p eId="para_93"> I acknowledge the tsunami victory that the "Yes" campaign achieved over the weekend. I was very interested in the remarks made by the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin. As a practising Catholic, I believe that unless the Catholic Church takes heed of the seismic shift in Irish society it will decline further into the abyss. His remarks were encouraging and acknowledged the situation in which we find ourselves. It is important that this is done because, historically, the Catholic Church has buried its head in the sand. I would like to see a move in the Catholic Church to a more centrist position and to an acknowledgement of how society is evolving. If it does not do that, unfortunately, the church to which I have been attached since my childhood - as a practising Catholic I will probably die a member of it - is certainly going nowhere and on a hiding to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I also acknowledge the tremendous work done by my colleague, Senator David Norris. I became a Member of the Seanad on 27 October 1989.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">At that stage Senator David Norris was ploughing a lonely furrow, not only in this House but in the country and he was often scoffed at by members of my party and other parties. I admire his tenacity and his courage in holding out. He won a very successful court case in Europe, which led to the then Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, taking on board the decriminalisation of homosexuality. At the request of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, in 2002 and 2003, I chaired a committee on the Constitution which was the first group to examine the whole area of the family and to recommend civil partnership. It was a big step in that direction. At the time I had many discussions with Senator David Norris both on and off the record. It was my view then that a referendum to change the situation at that time would probably have failed. That was my view and it was the majority view of the committee. It was a large committee. I specifically requested the Taoiseach to bring on board the Independents, Sinn Féin and the Green Party. Our work was acknowledged, but it would be remiss of me today, as the deputy leader of this group and on behalf of Fianna Fáil, not to congratulate the "Yes" side. If any person in this country was the catalyst for change who often ploughed a lone furrow, that is Senator David Norris and I bow to him today.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Before I ask for a debate, I congratulate Senator Denis O'Donovan and the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the farm safety report, which will be very useful. We look forward to debating it in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> It is less than 100 years since te country gained independence. The momentous decision at the weekend shows how much we have moved on in that 100 years. It has vindicated the work done by Senators David Norris, Katherine Zappone and many others in this House. </p>
          <p eId="para_98"> With regard to the result of the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny, I congratulate my old adversary from Kilkenny County Council, my good friend Bobby Aylward on his election to Dáil Éireann. I look forward to working with him as a constituency colleague. I also congratulate my colleague, Councillor David Fitzgerald, who put up a good show on the Fine Gael ticket.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> It is with regard to the by-election and the referendum that I raise this matter. I ask the Deputy Leader to request a debate on the electoral system. It can be seen that the referendum captured the imagination of the people when one notes that more than 65,000 people registered to vote and more than 2,500 of those were in Carlow-Kilkenny, whether for the by-election or the referendum. However, what concerns me is that in the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election there were 2,066 spoiled votes, that is, 3% of those who voted, whereas in the referendum vote the proportion of spoiled votes was 1%, over 600 votes, which is the national average. I saw the boxes being opened because I was helping with the tally, and I saw the spoiled votes being counted and sorted. More than 1,000 of those spoiled votes had no preference marked on the paper. Therefore, there were people who wanted to vote in the referendum but did not offer any preference as to whom they wanted as their representative for Carlow-Kilkenny. Besides the 1,000 papers which showed no preference, there were also spoiled votes that had the usual comments written on them. Perhaps people are entitled to do as they wish with their vote, but in my view, young people need to be educated on how our PR system works. As seasoned politicians, we are often baffled as to how voting preferences work. I noted that some voting papers had 12 preferences indicated for 13 candidates. It is important that people vote down the list on the voting paper.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I will conclude. I called for this debate previously. People should not need to register themselves because a PPS number should be a means of automatic inclusion in the electoral register.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">If that were the case, we would not have this situation where 65,000 people were obliged to apply to go on the supplementary register. As I said, the number of spoiled votes, at 2,066, and non-transferable votes in the by-election worries me.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">It is such a privilege to stand up in the House and welcome the decision of the people to say "Yes" to marriage equality. I acknowledge our great hero and champion, Senator David Norris, with all of the colleagues who participated in bringing forward that outcome. I acknowledge, too, all the citizens who voted, whether "Yes" or "No", for their engagement and the depth of their reflection on their values and on the arguments from both sides. My Dublin South-West Yes Equality team visited approximately 25,000 households in the course of the campaign and had at least 10,000 conversations with residents on the doorstep. I was deeply moved, time and again, by how Irish people engaged in these conversations and showed their care for the State. I had the wonderful opportunity yesterday to speak with our former President, Mary Robinson, about the referendum. One of the things she said to me was that it feels like we are back to the early years of her Presidency, when there was great engagement, hope and a vision for change for Ireland, and a consideration of how we might offer that example of change to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the spokespeople for the "No" side, particularly those who sit on the opposite side of this Chamber. I witnessed their immense dedication to this debate time and again. Although we disagreed deeply, I always felt personally respected by them, for which I thank them.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> When my life partner, Ann Louise Gilligan, soon to be acknowledged as my spouse in the eyes of this republic, and I conducted our case in the courts almost a decade ago, one of the arguments put forward by our legal counsel was that our human right to marry each other should exist, even if the majority did not agree, and it was the role of the courts to protect the rights of those in the minority. I take this chance to express, one final time, our profound gratitude to that legal team. It included Senator Ivana Bacik who sits in this Chamber with me today. When we saw that the decision on this fundamental right was to move from the courts to the people, it was not easy in the beginning. However, we came to the view that if the majority of the people were to say "Yes" to equality, freedom and love, it would far outweigh the import of any judicial decision, even that of the highest court in the land. I thank the people of Ireland for their decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I join colleagues in voicing my delight at the result in the marriage referendum and thanking all those who worked hard to get it over the line. I take the opportunity to acknowledge Senator David Norris as the path finder on this human rights issue and for his role in leading us to a more modern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> President John F. Kennedy famously said, "[Ask] not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." Yesterday, the country lost one of its famous sons with the passing of Mr. Bill O'Herlihy. Bill did more for the country than many a man for many a decade. He united us all, coming into our living rooms in the depths of winter and the heat of summer. He thrilled and excited us, whether we won, lost or drew. He was a genius of a journalist, combining that skill with his television broadcasting. He got the best out of the so-called experts with whom he worked. Not just on television but also in his place of work and with his family and friends, Bill was provocative and stimulating. He stimulated debate and touched the nerve of the nation like no other before him and perhaps like no other after him. It is often said achieving fulfilment is less about what one gets out of life and more about what one puts into it. Bill put so much into his life, and we as a nation are richer and better for it. He was a great friend and mentor to me and many others in the world of sports. He will be dearly missed by all of those who were privileged to know him. To his wife, Hilary, his daughters, Jill and Sally, and his grandchildren, family, friends and colleagues in RTE, I offer my deepest condolences.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">At exactly this time tomorrow, Bill was scheduled to play in a fourball with his mates. He would not give a gimme and there would be no mulligans. It would be pure golf. I know that he is watching and that his friends with whom he was scheduled to play tomorrow are deep in grief and are asking whether they should play. What Bill is saying right now is: "Lads, go out and play. Life is too short. Enjoy. Your round is not up yet. Make the most of life." May he rest in peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I will confine myself to saying, "Well done, Ireland." I would like to mention the wonderful work done by the Leas-Chathaoirleach and his committee which took evidence from both sides quite impartially. I say this because it is the only aspect that has not been mentioned and complimented. Everyone else has been already. I look forward with great interest to the Government's legislation which will give effect to this enabling clause in the Constitution. There are certain anomalies that need to be ironed out, for example, pension irregularities and the question of section 37 of the equality legislation, which allows schools, at least theoretically, to dismiss people for their lifestyles being in conflict. That issue has been parked, but what about the presidential age referendum? It was a complete and utter farce.</p>

It was an altruistic motion. The people should have a say. The motion went through by 96%, by far the highest percentage of any vote taken by the convention, but what has the Government done about it? Nothing. It produced a farce about the presidential age.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">The people of Ireland made a significant and monumental decision. What stood out in the campaign was the considerable debate on radio and television. Everyone who participated on both sides of the argument is to be complimented on informing the general public about all of the issues pertaining to the referendum. Democracy was well served and people made their decisions based on everything they had heard. The outcome was a good day for citizens who have felt undervalued and under-respected down the decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I join Senator Eamonn Coghlan in extending our deepest sympathy to the family of the late Bill O'Herlihy, a much loved and much respected journalist. Some of us remember when he presented "7 Days", including that famous programme about moneylending all of those years ago, where he cut his teeth in the world of politics. We were present with him on every great sporting occasion for the country. He was a wonderful businessman who lived life to the full and brought out the best in everyone with whom he worked. It was great to hear former colleagues speaking with such high regard for him and the advice and mentoring he gave many through the years.</p>

All the people who participated in the hearings and fed into that wonderful report should be complimented, but it is incumbent on all of us to highlight its contents.

          <p eId="para_143"> Although it is important to recognise the role played by political and public figures, the referendum on marriage equality last weekend was a win for the citizens of the State and a great day for them. The grassroots movement that came forward to canvass on behalf of a "Yes" vote was phenomenal and it was great to see the outpourings of joy. I am disappointed the second referendum on equality did not pass because I do not see a difference between a citizen who is aged 18 years and one who is aged 88 and it was disappointing that the referendum did not pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> As "equality" is now the buzzword and most politicians were willing to wear Yes Equality badges, although some were a little shy, we need to examine other equality issues in the State. I refer to the economic and social inequality and the growing disparity between those who have and those who have not. We also need to consider the issue of child poverty, which was debated in the media yesterday. It is an ongoing debate. This issue affects children in all spheres of life. In a number of days, 10,000 lone parents in Galway will have their benefits cut because of changes being introduced to their social welfare payments. It was pointed out at the inaugural ISPCC lecture that 1,000 children live in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin, which is unacceptable, while more than 1,400 children are in direct provision centres. They are certainly not equal in the eyes of the State. It would be appropriate for us in light of the concerns raised by HIQA yesterday and by other Members to have a debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on the issue of direct provision, which has cross-party support. It is a comprehensive report with comprehensive proposals, which I am sure Senator David Norris will welcome when we have the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_146"> I would like to raise the issue of start-ups. Last Thursday, in Galway, I attended a meeting where representatives of multinational companies, large corporates, local authorities, universities and institutes of technology were present to discuss the Startup Gathering, which will run throughout Ireland between 5 and 10 October. In excess of 50 events will take place that week in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and other urban centres. The aim of the event is to be one of the largest regional start-up events in the world. The Startup Gathering is part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 and supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I encourage colleagues from all parties and Independent Senators to get involved with the Startup Gathering taking place in their localities. This initiative is the brainchild of Eoin Costello who is a very impressive individual. What he is doing is fundamental in the context of getting people back to work and in terms of supporting SMEs and other businesses in their efforts to get up and running. If we are contemplating a recovery, the people concerned will continue to form the backbone of the economy.</p>

The people are remarkable because they will always follow the truth if the truth is authentic. In this instance, they followed the truth. Our common humanity can never be undermined. The referendum was about our common humanity and that influenced how the people voted. I congratulate them on voting the way they did. I inform Senators David Norris, Katherine Zappone and others that what has been achieved has been coming for a long time and it has now found its rightful place in our society. I am very glad and congratulate all of my colleagues and the great Irish people for their sense of what constitutes truth. The people will never let one down when the truth is invoked. I also thank the Labour Party and Fine Gael which created the platform in both the Lower and Upper Houses to allow the referendum to come about and ensure people could vote in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I remind the House that it was the Taoiseach's nominees who imagined and initiated the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, out of which have come the reports on farm safety, positive aging in Ireland, alcoholism and many other matters.

The company will no longer allow any citizen in Ireland to pay his or her UPC bill at a local post office. The relationship in this regard is all over and UPC is walking away. One must now have a credit card or a debit card and a bank account to pay one's UPC bill. Many elderly people do not have any of these. UPC is capitulating to the great banking model. Some 3.5 million people use the services of An Post. The Government is trying to keep An Post alive but UPC, representatives of which went to An Post on their knees a few years ago begging it to allow their customers to use its facilities to pay their bills, is now walking away.</p>

Many older people do not have bank accounts, credit cards or debit cards. This is because they do not use the services of the banks. In fact, An Post is their bank, the reason for which is that it never let them down. I would like the Leader to provide an explanation of the position with regard to both UPC and the new social welfare forms.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">I join colleagues in welcoming the launch of the farm safety report. I congratulate Senators Denis O'Donovan and Martin Conway and the staff of the House on compiling such a good report. The report contains many good proposals and we look forward to their being implemented. For far too long there have been too many deaths on Irish farms. For example, there were more than 30 fatalities in 2014, and there have already been quite a number of very sad incidents to date this year. What we want to see happen is the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of farm safety. As many Senators outlined on that great day - 25 March last - when the House debated this matter, it all must begin with education. The farming organisations, Teagasc and all of those involved in farming at every level were involved with the committee's consultation process on this matter. I look forward to the implementation of the proposals contained in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_192"> On the equality referendum, like everyone else, I pay tribute to the Yes Equality campaign. On the night before the vote, it was interesting to see more than 700 people working in Cork city as they distributed leaflets and worked on the campaign. It was a huge contribution that people made to democracy. The debate that took place within families was very interesting and was summed up for me when I knocked on a door and thought I was disturbing a party. The person who answered had a pint glass in his hand and stated he was voting "No" but that they were all at him, because while there was a party under way there also was a major debate. The great thing about this referendum was the debate within families and how people voted for what they believed in firmly, whether on the "Yes" side or the "No" side.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">That was the great contribution of this referendum to democracy. Likewise, I hope people will look at the issues in a very fair and balanced way and come to their own decisions, whether it is in a referendum, local election or general election.

The Bank of Ireland has stated it has no intention of reducing its rate, yet the Minister has given us the impression that he convinced it or had made a case that had been accepted. We would like to have the position clarified. The only one who can answer that is the Minister.

          <p eId="para_195">I join colleagues in expressing joy at the result of the referendum. It was a proud day to be Irish and an even more proud day to be Senator David Norris or Senator Katherine Zappone or any of those who went public with their personal stories. It was the likes of those interventions that made the difference in this campaign. I personally know someone very significant in my life who was intent on voting "No" and who is quite elderly. I did not ask her on the day but she said she had heard so many personal stories about people's circumstances throughout the campaign that when it came to it she voted "Yes". I was personally delighted about that. Obviously, a lot more than she voted "Yes". We were the talk of the world, which is important, but the effect it will have on citizens is much more important and it is definitely something to celebrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I briefly welcome the consumer regulations that have been proposed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in respect of gift vouchers and other vouchers. A great many of those who issue vouchers have overly onerous terms for them. While I await the detail I welcome the initiative. We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter when it comes before the House. I would welcome clarification from the Minister on one minor concern, perhaps through the Deputy Leader, in terms of how the regulation will impact on businesses and their balance sheets. Does the Minister propose a mechanism to ensure vouchers will not remain a permanent liability on the balance sheets of businesses, given that there is a likelihood that a percentage of gift vouchers will never be redeemed? It would seem wise to try to formalise a structure that would ensure a balance of fairness to both consumers and businesses. I very much welcome the proposals that have been outlined to date by the Minister.</p>

The result is due to the people, not necessarily the political system. It was the people who went out and got the votes. I was particularly struck at the count on Saturday in the RDS at the inverse relationship between the "Yes" to the referendum on marriage equality and the referendum on the age of candidates for the Presidency. A seismic shift is taking place in the country, namely, a total and utter rejection of what the Government regards as reform. How dare it bring forward a referendum seeking to reduce the age of candidates for the Presidency to 21 years? What effort was put in to push that referendum over the line?</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I acknowledge the result of the referendum on marriage and thank Senator Katherine Zappone, in particular, for her very gracious words. I would like to reciprocate - I am sure I speak for other "No" campaigners - by stating I always felt respected by the Senator. I extend good wishes to her and Ann Louise. If the proposal had been rejected, it would have behoved those of us who had advocated a "No" vote to seek some kind of a generous accommodation. For example, we could have considered whether the law on civil partnership, an issue that arose during the debate, needed to be amended or strengthened. By the same token, it is important to recognise that the 730,000 people who voted "No" are not mired in ignorance or atavism but have a different view on marriage. They retain their views which should be respected. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> From now on, rather than having culture wars, we should consider how we can accommodate different visions of important issues in society. We could start by taking a generous view in the section 37 debate. It is important that schools of different denominations and ethos are entitled to transmit the values that are dear to them and reflect their foundational ethos and that of the people who send their children to them. We do not have to take a winner takes all approach to these issues. I look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue with people who take a different view from me on the meaning of marriage and hope the Government will lead this dialogue instead of seeking to press home its advantage. </p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Incidentally, it would be good if the 38% of voters who voted "No" were represented by 38%, more or less, of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is an issue for the parties to consider. </p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The rural practice allowance for general practitioners working in rural areas is paid to GPs to defray the additional costs of running a practice in a rural area. These include the greater number of house calls they must make to older patients than doctors in urban areas. Some of them also act as dispensing agents for medicines in locations where pharmacists are not readily available.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Under the scheme a doctor is paid the allowance where his or her practice is in an area three miles from a town or village which has more than 1,500 people. A local medical service is absolutely vital to older people living in relatively isolated areas with limited or no rural transport. Furthermore, access to primary care locally helps reduce the number of people who present themselves. I raised this issue previously when I informed the House that the Health Service Executive was revising the terms of the statutory scheme by stealth.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">Last winter I asked about the role of the energy regulator when the cost of fuel went through the roof. We were promised then that electricity costs would fall by the end of April. I have not been contacted by anybody whose electricity bills have dropped as a consequence. The electricity suppliers promised that the cost of electricity would drop. Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the job description of the energy regulator? As of this morning, crude oil cost $59 a barrel, yet the price of petrol has risen consistently in the past few weeks to between €1.41.9 and €1.42.9 per litre. Fuel costs have risen weekly. What is the job of the energy regulator? How can the fuel companies substantiate raising the cost of fuel when a barrel of crude oil is $59?</p>

          <p eId="para_231">In respect of the referendum last Friday, this House has a very proud history of debating civil and human rights, civil liberty and equality issues. This Seanad has justified the need for this House. I sincerely congratulate Senator David Norris, the father of the House, who has been here for many years, as well as Senator Katherine Zappone. While we have fantastic debaters and a fantastic debate on marriage equality took place in this Chamber, the real debate took place in our homes with our families, where people thrashed out the issues. Irish people came to the conclusion we would stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with our aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, friends and neighbours to show them this is a welcome, open and free society that has a very proud history of standing up for what is right. In some parts of the world people are put to death because of their sexuality. This vote has made us a beacon of hope to other parts of the world. I spoke to gay friends in Australia, Bahrain and Germany who are over the moon with this result and could not thank the Irish people enough. We have broken the chains of repression in that 1937 document, written by de Valera and McQuaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Travelling around my constituency, I noticed a huge change. I went to de Valera's home town of Bruree and could see the spring in people's step when they were leaving the polling station. They knew that they were making a serious change. To paraphrase a former Member, repressive Ireland is now dead and gone and is with McQuaid in the grave, while romantic Ireland is definitely making a huge comeback.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> A major feature of the campaign was the influence of social media. The hashtag I saw on the morning of the referendum, #hometovote, really blew me away. We saw emigrants, who cannot vote from abroad, putting their holiday funds into coming home to exercise their democratic right. It was inspiring to see such a mobilisation of young people to bring the country into a new age of enlightenment. They took aeroplanes, trains, buses, boats, automobiles, you name it, to get home to cast their vote. I congratulate them sincerely.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I am conscious that it is a momentous day shortly after the result in the marriage equality referendum, to which most colleagues referred and in almost all cases they welcomed the result. It was very moving to listen to their comments and strong expressions of welcome for the resounding majority of 62% in favour of marriage equality. It was a magnificent result and, as many have said, reflects the immense social change that has already occurred. It reflects a common humanity, inclusivity, positivity and joy in Irish society. In particular, I commend Senators David Norris and Katherine Zappone for their immense work and contributions to the change that has come about. The referendum result marks the end of an incredible journey. For many of us who were involved in the campaign for marriage equality going back more than ten years, as Senator Katherine Zappone said, the journey has been remarkable. I also pay tribute to my own party, the Labour Party, on championing the cause when it was not popular.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I commend Deputy Eamon Gilmore, our former party leader, who personally championed the issue of marriage equality and described it as the civil liberties issue of this generation. He has been vindicated. I also commend the Constitutional Convention which, through its 79% majority vote in support of marriage equality, placed the referendum very firmly on the Government's agenda. We then saw the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all of the political parties, with the Government, championing the cause of marriage equality. I pay tribute to all those who campaigned and canvassed so hard, particularly civil society groups such as the Yes Equality coalition. This coalition galvanised huge numbers of young and older people to canvass. I was canvassing with them and the Labour Party across Dublin Bay south. It was incredible to see the immense numbers who had come out. Tribute should be paid to Ms Gráinne Healy, Mr. Brian Sheehan and all those who led the Yes Equality grouping from the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, Marriage Equality to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. Others have mentioned Home to Vote, which was a very moving, last-minute campaign. I had a friend who flew home from the Middle East for 24 hours to vote. </p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Colleagues have talked about the national conversation and the personal stories that contributed to the incredible majority support in favour of marriage equality. I thank the many colleagues who spoke so eloquently about the result. What a great celebration we had all weekend at the RDS and in Dublin Castle, as well as in other venues in Dublin and all around Ireland. The result was echoed across the country in every constituency, except one. Senator Darragh O'Brien welcomed the result of the referendum and pointed out that it was an historic day.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">He also referred to the small break-up in Fianna Fáil that perhaps might have tarnished things somewhat for the party. That is obviously a matter for Fianna Fáil. I personally commend Senator Averil Power for all the great work she has done in the Seanad, as Senator Darragh O'Brien did. She has made a very important contribution on many issues in the Seanad for many years and I am sure she will continue to do so as an Independent. <b>
						</b>For many of us, how she stuck with it for so long is a mystery, but that is the only comment I want to make on what is an internal matter for Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">Senator Darragh O'Brien asked a specific question about when we were likely to see the marriage Bill. A draft Bill has been published on the Taoiseach's Department's website and the Minister for Justice and Equality has announced that she will have the Bill enacted by the end of July to enable same-sex couples to get married. She intends to seek Government approval for the final draft of the Bill in June and the aim is to introduce it in the Oireachtas immediately thereafter in order that it can be enacted before the end of this term in July. It will include a provision to enable couples to convert a notification of intention to enter a civil partnership into a notification of intention to enter a marriage. Clearly, that will make things more efficient and speed things up for couples who have already registered their intention to enter a civil partnership, which is very welcome. I know that we will have a full debate on the Bill in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Senator Darragh O'Brien also welcomed the new Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny, Deputy Bobby Aylward. We all join in wishing him the very best. I also commend Councillor Willie Quinn, the Labour Party candidate in Carlow-Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned the Aer Lingus bid. I understand the Cabinet is to reconvene after 6 p.m. today to consider IAG's offer. There are reports that the offer represents a significant improvement on what was offered before. I understand the Cabinet has adjourned until after 6 p.m., given the volume of detailed information involved. The Government's underlying position remains unchanged. The shareholding will not be sold, unless market conditions are favourable and key concerns are addressed on a number of issues. I have certainly made my own view clear that I do not agree with the sale of 25%-----</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I note SIPTU has stated it wants to see commitments on jobs, in particular, which is very important. Senator Darragh O'Brien also asked that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, come to the House to brief us on the issue. That is very fair and I will ask the Minister to do this, as it would be most useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Senator Paul Coghlan welcomed the public consultation committee's report on farm safety which was published today. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been formally invited to come to the House to debate this welcome report on a very important issue. We certainly hope to have that debate shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the marriage equality referendum result. I agree that it was a momentous day and thank her for her kind comments. She also sought a debate on the system of direct provision and, in particular, that the report commissioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, be debated in the Seanad first. I will certainly look for that to happen because it would be appropriate, given the huge amount of work the Seanad has done on the issue, on which I have asked for a briefing. I understand the report is at a very advanced stage and due to be completed in the near future. I hope we can have that debate before the end of this term.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Senator Sean D. Barrett raised the issue of Aer Lingus. I cannot accede to his request to amend the Order of Business. I will, however, ask the Minister for Transpoprt, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paaschal Donohoe, to come to the House once he is in a position to do so to discuss the issue with us. We can, therefore, have a debate on the deal, although it would be premature to do so today.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Senator Marie Moloney asked for a debate on funding to support national organisations and the Minister for Health to come to the House. I will certainly look to that debate arranged.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> A large number of Senators spoke and I am conscious that we would be here for some time if I was to respond to all of them. Many of them have not stayed to hear the responses to their requests. I did say the last time I was Deputy Leader that I did not believe we should continue to facilitate those who came into the Chamber, often at the very end of the Order of Business, to speak and then left when other colleagues were trapped here, listening to a lengthy response from the Leader to Members who were not present. With the permission of those who are in the Chamber, I will only respond to those who are present and if anyone listening on the monitor wants to receive a response, he or she can come to the House. On that basis, I will respond to Senator Katherine Zappone, to whom again I pay tribute. She welcomed the result of the marriage equality referendum and spoke about the incredible journey it had been for her personally and Ms Ann Louise Gilligan. I wish her the very best. Her proposal on television was very moving.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> With customary eloquence, Senator David Norris spoke about referendum fatigue. He is quite right that the debate has to move on also. I pay tribute to him for his enormous work on the issue. We will have the marriage Bill before the end of July and there is also the Private Members' Bill I introduced two years ago dealing with section 37 which, as the House knows, is before the Seanad.</p>

It would, therefore, be appropriate to have a debate when we receive the report from the two Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I accept Senator Feargal Quinn's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. He also asked for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss variable mortgage rates. I will look for that debate. Last week the Minister held a series of meetings with Ireland's six main mortgage lenders, focusing on the high standard variable rates being charged by the banks. The matter is under ongoing review.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Senator Catherine Noone referred to the gift voucher proposal made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton. Like the Senator, I welcome the proposal. She may know that in the previous Seanad my colleague, former Senator Brendan Ryan, introduced a Private Members' Bill on the issue. The proposal is long overdue in the context of consumer rights. We will see if the Bill can be introduced in the Seanad because we have had a debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Senator Gerard P. Craughwell referred to the referendum on the age of presidential candidates. It is regrettable that it was defeated. The Senator also asked for more time for statements on the national drugs strategy. Ample time is being given for the debate on the Customs Bill 2014, the debate on which is to be adjourned not later than 7 p.m. Members will have plenty of time to speak to it. Statements on the national drugs strategy will finish at 8.30 p.m., but I will ask the Minister of State to return to the House on another occasion to continue the debate if more Members still wish to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">I am pleased to be here to debate the Customs Bill 2014 which was published on 3 October 2014. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, revise and modernise Ireland's existing national customs legislation, some of it dating back to the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. The Customs Bill can thus be seen as another significant milestone in the Revenue Commissioners' comprehensive programme to consolidate and modernise our tax and duty legislation. Senators should note, however, that this is not a standard statutory consolidation of the existing customs legislation. Instead, it includes the two additional elements of revision and modernisation, both of which were necessary to cater for developments in trade and technology that have taken place over nearly 140 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The principal domestic legislation under which Irish customs currently operates is the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. This Act has been extensively adapted over the years to take account of various events and developments - for example, the foundation of the State in 1922, Ireland's joining the EEC in 1973 and the introduction of the EU Single Market in 1993. As a consequence, many of the provisions in the 1876 Act are now of doubtful validity, yet they remain on the Statute Book. In addition, a number of other Acts concerning customs matters were also passed in the intervening period, including the Customs Act 1956 and the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988. Numerous Finance Acts have also over the years introduced customs measures, as have a number of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972. The result is a complicated, overlapping structure of both old and newer national customs legislation which can be difficult to follow and understand. The Customs Bill is designed to address this. When enacted, the Customs Bill will repeal the old structure with a single, very much shorter Customs Act, which will be clear, easy to understand and easy to access, which is what we should strive for in all legislation. This consolidated approach, which is in accordance with the requirements of Better Regulation, will result in much clearer legislation in the customs area, to the benefit of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Senators should be aware that there is also a European dimension to this. The European Union customs legislation - known as the Community Customs Code - now directly provides most of the legal framework for customs, including the rules relating to rates of customs duty in different circumstances, customs valuation, the form of declarations and so on. As a consequence, national legislation is needed only in respect of those areas that are not already covered by European Union legislation. Typically, these areas include certain control provisions, enforcement powers and sanctions for breaches of the various customs provisions. This trend can be seen in the structure and the very much smaller size of the Customs Bill. The bulk of the material in the Bill reflects a small core of existing legal provisions in relation to customs, now updated to reflect modern language and terminology. This includes certain controls and procedures that are not included in Community legislation, mainly related to arriving and departing vessels and aircraft; specifying the various offences that arise in a customs context, for the most part involving smuggling; specifying the penalties associated with these offences and the procedures to be followed in court proceedings; and providing the necessary powers to customs officers to enforce customs law.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The Bill also includes a number of administrative and housekeeping provisions, among them the repeal and revocation of a large body of existing legislation, much of it of old vintage, which will become redundant on the enactment of the Bill and its subsequent commencement. Similarly, the Bill provides for the meeting of a number of specific EU and international customs obligations relating to mutual assistance between Ireland and other member states, to controls of cash entering or leaving the European Union through the State and to centralised customs clearance.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Bill also carries forward the existing customs appeals procedures. The new legislative provisions are simply a reiteration of the procedures that currently apply and any subsequent change applied to the tax appeals procedures will have appropriate application to customs appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The Bill also restates and modernises the existing legislation applying customs law to prohibited or restricted goods on their import into, or export from, the State. The Bill sets out the rate of interest to be applied on customs duties that are not paid on time. Lastly, the Bill updates the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of Revenue offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Before I go through a Part-by-Part explanation of the Bill, I ask Senators to try to imagine the environment for which the original 1876 Act was designed to cater and the social and political mores of those times. I like to think we have moved on considerably from then and that, for example, we no longer have a need for some of the more extreme powers with which customs were conferred at that time. However, we will always have those who will try to outwit our customs rules and, therefore, not everything has changed in the Customs Bill before the House. Senators might wish to be reminded of the scale of the customs operation in modern day Ireland. For example, Irish customs annually process, on the automated entry processing system, approximately 1.1 million customs declarations in respect of goods being imported from, or exported to, non-European Union countries. This breaks down into roughly 600,000 declarations in respect of imports and roughly 550,000 in respect of exports. Customs duty collected on such imports was €277 million for 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> However, it is not just the scale of the customs operation that should be noted. Irish customs also have an enviable reputation regarding the way that they do this business and it is important to acknowledge this. Senators might like to note that in recent reports from respected international bodies such as the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the Swiss-based Institute for Management Development, Ireland, and in particular Irish customs, has scored highly in terms of ease of doing business with them. Some of the rankings achieved by Ireland, in categories in which Irish customs have a direct involvement, are as follows. In the category "trading across borders", Ireland scored fifth in the world and second in the European Union. In the category "burden of customs procedures", Ireland scored eighth in the world and third in the European Union. In the category "efficient transit of goods", Ireland emerged as the leader in the world, beating Singapore into second place. Senators will agree that these rankings paint an excellent picture of the way that Irish customs go about their business and that the Revenue Commissioners are to be congratulated on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> With that in mind, I will now go through the Customs Bill and describe the main provisions contained therein. Part 1 includes the usual preliminary and general provisions that apply to legislation of this type. Thus, it provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Bill; for the interpretation of certain words and expressions used in the Bill; for the repeal of certain statutes and the revocation of certain statutory instruments; and for a number of technical linkages to provide for legal certainty and for legal continuity in the operation of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Part 2 of the Bill deals with customs controls. Accordingly, it provides for the appointment of customs ports and airports for the arrival and departure of vessels and aircraft into, or out of, the State; for the approval of places within customs ports and airports for the arrival of vessels and aircraft, for the loading and unloading of goods and stores, for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and for the storage of goods awaiting customs clearance; for the control by customs of movement of vessels and aircraft into and out of the State; for the reporting on vessels and aircraft, respectively, arriving in or departing from the State; for the control by customs of persons entering or leaving the State and of their baggage; and lastly, for the continuation of the existing control by customs of postal traffic into and out of the State. Each of the relevant sections provides for an offence for contravention of the provisions of the section and for the penalty that applies. </p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Part 3 deals, in the first instance, with customs offences and penalties. Thus, it provides for offences relating to improper import or export of goods, that is to say without payment of any duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction on their import or export, and for other customs-related offences, primarily related to non-compliance with a requirement imposed by a customs officer performing his or her duties, or interference with customs property or equipment, or adapting conveyances for smuggling purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> In both cases the sections reflect provisions in current legislation and they provide for the penalties that apply. Part 3 also deals with various aspects of customs-related court proceedings. As such, it provides for determining whether a customs offence is to be tried summarily or on indictment; for the forfeiture of goods which have been illegally imported or attempted to be illegally exported, that is to say without payment of duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction; for a notice of seizure to be given to the owner of goods, where the goods are seized by a customs officer; for a notice of claim to be made by a person who claims that something seized as liable to forfeiture was not so liable; for court proceedings for condemnation of seized goods; for the rules for court proceedings in relation to customs offences; for the question of damages and costs in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant, on account of the seizing or detention of any thing; and lastly, for presumptions and onus of proof in proceedings under the Customs Acts, that is to say where certain things may be presumed to be true until the contrary is proved. In all these areas, the sections are a restatement and modernisation of existing customs provisions and no changes of substance are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Part 4 deals with customs powers. Thus, it provides customs officers with powers to enter, inspect and patrol certain places without a court warrant; to stop vessels, aircraft, vehicles and other means of transport in different circumstances; to board and search conveyances that are entering or leaving the State, as well as away from ports and airports and the land frontier; to examine goods under customs control; to enter and search a specified premises or land under a search warrant issued by a judge of the District Court and to seize and detain anything found in the course of the search which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under the Customs Acts or any other enactment; to search persons in certain circumstances and subject to certain safeguards; to stop and question a person entering or leaving the State as regards their journey and their baggage and, if necessary, to search that baggage; to arrest without warrant a person who a customs officer suspects is committing, or has committed, certain offences, or where the person has obstructed or assaulted a customs officer; to detain goods being imported or exported, pending the outcome of inquiries and investigations into whether the goods in question are in compliance with the Customs Acts; and lastly, to seize any goods that are liable to forfeiture under the Customs Acts and to deal with seizures, whether before or after the goods have been condemned by the courts. Such powers are essential control requirements to ensure compliance with both EU and national customs legislation and, crucially, to prevent smuggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Part 5 deals with general customs administrative matters. Most of the sections are standard provisions in legislation relating to the Revenue Commissioners. They provide that the duties of customs are under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners; that the commissioners may authorise customs officers to carry out various functions; that certain powers, functions or duties may be delegated to an officer of the commissioners; and that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance, respectively, may make regulations for the purposes of giving effect to the Customs Act and of giving full effect to the community customs code.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Part 6 deals with EU and international customs obligations. As such, it provides for a system of penalties for contravention of certain customs rules and procedures; for the continuation of the force of law in respect of the Naples II Convention, which governs mutual assistance between EU customs authorities in relation to criminal matters; for the application by Ireland of the 2009 EU Council decision on the use of information technology for customs purposes; for controls of cash entering or leaving the European Union through the State; and lastly, for the ratification by Ireland of the EU Council convention of 10 May 2009 on centralised customs clearance, concerning the allocation of national collection costs when customs duties are made available to the EU budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Part 7 provides for the appeal procedures in relation to customs decisions and assessments of customs duty. As I stated, these sections are a restatement of the existing legislation. Part 8 deals with a number of miscellaneous provisions. The first of these restates and modernises the existing legislation applying customs law to prohibited or restricted goods on their import into, or export from, the State. The second provides for the charging of interest arising from late payment of customs duties. Lastly, the Bill amends section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of Revenue offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> I commend the Bill to the House. I look forward to the debate on Second Stage and teasing out any issue on Committee and Remaining Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I thank the Minister of State for outlining the main sections of the Bill and presenting it in the House. My party supports the passage of the Bill. It is mainly a technical Bill to bring legislation, some of it dating back to 1876, up to date. In particular, the two subsections relating to the forfeiture of goods in cases where duty is not paid and the confiscation of goods are important. I pay tribute to the work of the Customs service and Revenue, in particular the customs enforcement teams. We must continue to resource them appropriately, with adequate facilities and legislation to back them up in their job.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Designating areas for planes and boats and for cargo to be offloaded, as well as searched, is important. Our criminal gangs are becoming more sophisticated and are operating internationally. With this in mind, it is important the Government and the Oireachtas support the work customs does every day. Many times this House, as well as the other House, has discussed fuel laundering and alcohol and tobacco smuggling, activities in which the State loses hundreds of millions of euro of revenue. People need to understand that by participating in this, they are effectively taking money away from the State that could be used for important services such as health and the Garda while lining the pockets of criminals. People should not support the black market in any way, shape or form, particularly in purchasing white goods, tobacco, alcohol and fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> The Minister of State outlined the record of our customs teams against international standards. How well they have performed against those international benchmarks shows what a good job they are doing. Fianna Fáil supports this Bill and looks forward to going into it in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Senator Tom Sheahan<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_396">I welcome the Minister of State and the Customs Bill 2014. I have several queries relating to conflicting provisions in the Bill which I wish to flag.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Part 4, dealing with customs officers’ powers, provides them with powers to enter, inspect and patrol certain places without a court warrant. Another Part, however, provides officers with powers to enter and search specified premises or land under a search warrant issued by a judge of a District Court. Why are we allowing for powers to enter and search where a court warrant is needed and for other occasions when it is not needed? Will the Minister of State, please, define this provision?</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> One section provides for a customs officer in uniform but another section refers to somebody who is not a Revenue official. Is Revenue thinking of outsourcing? What comes to mind here is a Revenue Commissioner doing his or her job with, say, the Viper. As it stands, if a garda enters a house, he or she will not have Joe Bloggs with him or her. This provision, however, will allow a customs officer and other people Revenue sees fit to, say, enter a premises. What category of person does this involve?</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Section 22 provides "that in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant on account of the seizing or detention of any thing, the plaintiff will not be entitled to any damages or costs, besides the thing seized or the value of such thing, and the defendant will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds there was probable cause for the seizure or detention.” I would just be a bit cúramach that this could be abused. Writing into the legislation that an official “will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds there was probable cause for the seizure or detention” is strong talk. I know it does not change the legislation but it is a measure with which we should be careful. It might be the language used that is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Section 23 provides that in proceedings under the Customs Acts, certain things may be presumed to be true until the contrary is proven. This allows cases to proceed without presentation of proof of certain specified matters, that is, that a person is or was a properly appointed and authorised officer of customs. Following on from my earlier question, what happens in cases regarding a person assisting a customs officer? If the Minister of State could clarify these issues, it would allay my fears.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AideenHayden" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_401">The Customs Bill 2014 seeks to consolidate and modernise national legislation relating to the administration of customs into a single Bill. As we saw in the legislation and from the Minister of State’s comprehensive statement, bar two particular sections, the Bill seeks to rationalise and improve existing legislation. It also seeks to consider the European dimension to customs, particularly the EU customs code and its implementing provisions which set out the rules and regulations relating to the import and export of goods and impose legal requirements and obligations on importers and exporters.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> It is important to acknowledge that Ireland is a small island nation with an extensive coastline which is difficult to police. We also maintain a common external border with the United Kingdom. We are separate from a number of European countries in this regard in that we are not members of the Schengen Agreement. Accordingly, we have greater difficulties in monitoring and maintaining customs services than a number of other European jurisdictions do. The cross-Border illegal activities over several years, the active part taken by Revenue in combating some of the more nefarious activities of petrol-stretching, cigarette trading and so forth, as well as the extensive fines imposed for customs offences, all show the challenges the Customs service faces every day. It is to its credit that we do not hear more about them. One is more likely to hear about a service that is causing a problem than one is to hear about a service that is not. Given the extensive difficulties the customs service has, including difficulties with illegal activities, north and south of the Border, it is noteworthy that it rates so highly when compared internationally. The Minister of State has mentioned that it has achieved high honours in a number of international reviews of custom services. According to the 2013 annual report of the Revenue Commissioners, Ireland is ranked fourth in Europe for efficiencies of customs administration and fifth in the world. It is clear that when one wants to have a good and well-functioning business environment, the efficiency and civility of a customs service, as well as one that is as first rate as ours, contributes to the overall business environment in a way that we sometimes do not recognise. It should be placed on the record that the functioning of our customs service contributes significantly, not just in financial terms, but to the overall efficiency of business in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> At European level, the extent of the role of the customs systems in contributing to the running of the European Union is sometimes forgotten. The quantum of value that import charges contribute to the overall EU budget is calculated to be €13.6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">That is no small or insignificant amount of money and it is very important that we recognise that for the European Union to be successful the European budget needs to have other forms of income rather than direct levies on the member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I was also struck to discover that we have approximately 2,000 staff in this country engaged through the Revenue Commissioners with customs activities and that they are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. There has been evidence in recent months that they do that effectively, given the significant fines levied. They are very active in the prevention of smuggling and evasion, investigations and prosecution and audit assurance checks, among other areas. It was news to me that we have two cutter boats in service. They are managed and operated by the Revenue maritime unit. It is important that the customs service is well funded. I echo the views of my colleagues on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> I also echo Senator Tom Sheahan’s view that the powers that are conferred on customs officials are extensive. Reference was made to the burden of proof, particularly under Part 3 as an example of where those powers are being extended. It does behove us when we extend powers on any organ of the State to do so with care. It is a testament to the Customs service that we have heard so little in terms of extending additional powers to them. They are held in high esteem and I do not think their competence or honesty has ever been called into question.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> We support the Bill. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, for coming to the House today to propose it.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">I welcome the Minister of State and the consolidation Bill he has proposed to the House. It is very interesting to reflect on the proposals being repealed. It shows the history of regulation in the customs area, from the Smuggling Act 1805 and subsequent legislation in 1807 up to the present day. Consolidation of the legislation is necessary. However, reflecting on what needs to be repealed reminds us that customs, barriers to trade and control of imports and exports have been a feature of world economic activity or non-activity for hundreds of years. We must all welcome the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I noted from the Minister of State’s opening speech that, in the lingo of our administrative masters, it is another significant milestone in the Revenue Commissioners’ comprehensive programme to consolidate and modernise our tax and duty legislation. When the public at large hear such a reference, they will be reminded of what Ronald Reagan deemed to be the most feared words in the English language, namely, "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help." Notwithstanding this, I welcome the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I have one or two observations which may be relevant. Section 28 concerns the power to examine goods, which is a necessary power. We are advised that a customs officer may examine goods that have been imported where he or she considers that there are grounds for certain suspicion. I might be on the wrong page, dealing with the wrong legislation or even addressing the matter to the wrong Minister. Reference has been made to smuggling, fuel laundering, petrol stretching, which is the new lingo, and diesel laundering. I have been asked by a number of persons in the trade to pose the question of why it is possible for a motorist driving a diesel car to be stopped by the Garda or customs officers in order that they can check whether the appropriate diesel is being used. I do not think we can object to that, but it appears that such inspectors are not able to visit a fuel depot or filling station to sample the product stored on the premises. Perhaps I am incorrect, but the argument has been presented to me that while an inspector can sample diesel in a car tank, he or she cannot sample diesel in a filling station. If that is correct, could such a power be granted under section 28? Will the Minister of State clarify the position? It might have been clarified already for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> The broader aspects of the Bill cause us to reflect on the fact that we have moved significantly over the past 30 to 40 years to a Europe of very free trade. We are progressing in some ways towards a world of even more free trade. Once we reach a better destination in that regard, customs and trade barriers will become less of a problem. We must also be cognisant of the debate that will take place in the United Kingdom in the next 12 months or two years on its relationship with the European Union. It is quite frightening to think of what might be the case along the northern borders of this island if the United Kingdom exits the European Union. One must pose the question of whether we will again be facing customs controls and Border checkpoints. It is so much in our interests economically and politically that the United Kingdom remain in the European Union. We are discussing the need for consolidation and progress in terms of our customs legislation, yet, from a North-South perspective, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, which hopefully it will not, the question of customs control will be very much back on our agenda. There is an obligation on all of us to ensure in particular that the sizeable Irish electorate in the United Kingdom who will vote on this referendum next year or the following year are very much aware of what a negative impact it would have on the economy of this country and the entire North-South project if Britain were to leave the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Senator Aideen Hayden presented an interesting figure in terms of staffing levels - namely, that there are 2,000 people, all of whom are no doubt busy. It must cause us to focus a little on the general cost of administration of taxation, with 2,000 people in the customs service, the people in charge of calculating, arguing and collecting property taxes, local authority motor taxation staff, those involved in collecting water charges and people checking for compliance with television licence regulations. Many of our taxation measures are hugely expensive to monitor and administer. If we drew up a balance sheet and came up with the cost of collection compared to the revenue that accrues, we would conclude that we must consider ways of introducing smarter taxation. The obvious one is motor tax, but that is a debate for another day. According to Senator Aideen Hayden, 2,000 people are employed in the customs unit. I am sure they are all very busy, but we must focus on the balance between the cost of administration and income generated.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The Minister of State might be able to answer my question. The question on diesel laundering might not be a valid one. I welcome the consolidation legislation, which is obviously necessary. Will the Minister of State ensure the Government remains committed to ensuring we will not have to reintroduce border controls on this island?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">In so far as we can play any role in ensuring the United Kingdom remains in the European Union, we should do so.</p>

          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_415">Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé féin agus mo pháirtí ag tacú leis an mBille seo. Tuigimid gur Bille teicniúil go leor é ach go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach ag an am céanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> My party will support the Bill. It is technical in nature, but we should underscore its importance. I join others in commending the work of the Customs service and the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their job in a professional manner. Yesterday, I attended my local city joint policing committee. The issue of the amount of drugs entering some of our urban areas was raised again. There has been an increase in Galway recently, particularly in heroin. The work done by the Customs service in trying to stamp out these practices is important and sometimes precarious.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Sinn Féin tabled amendments in the Dáil because we believed the Bill could be improved. It should be obvious to all that the way to tackle smuggling and laundering is through cross-Border policies and co-operation. I note Senators' comments about the Brexit, as it is being termed. It would cause major difficulties on this island. Ironically, we are concerned about the voting rights of Irish expatriates in Britain, who will vote on the Brexit, when we do not seem too concerned about making them return on boats, trains, aeroplanes and automobiles to vote in our referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Sinn Féin is on the record as having raised some concerns about the Bill, such as the measures empowering the holding of goods on what could be an indefinite basis and the legal exceptions that could be read as providing immunity for customs officers in some cases. However, I recognise that this is not the intention and that the Bill is a good one.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Our customs system is part of an EU system, which raises other important issues, such as the importing of goods that are labelled as Israeli and are therefore given preferential treatment under EU-Israel agreements but which originate in the illegally occupied territories of Palestine. Neither the European Union nor the Irish Government seems to have any interest in dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, will come down the tracks quickly unless progressive forces can organise to defeat it. It is a customs agreement with the USA. There are serious concerns. I have attended meetings with farmers, small business owners and so on about these issues. There are grave concerns among these groups in particular about the impact of the TTIP. The European Commission has a free hand in these negotiations due to the Lisbon treaty. The most damaging element of the TTIP is the investment state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism, which has been used in other jurisdictions such as Australia, under which multinational corporations can take a state to court if they believe that treaties are not being adhered to in a way that is feasible for them. From what we know of the mechanism, it is designed to allow corporations to sue states for having rules that hamper their profits. A foreseeable example is a corporation suing Ireland if the Government bans fracking. Environmentalists, trade unionists, farmers, many civil society groups and Sinn Féin MEPs have raised major concerns about what the TTIP will mean for Ireland and the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Something we cannot forget is how the Bill will affect citizens and others. My colleagues were contacted by Belfast residents who, on arrival back from a holiday in New York, were shocked to be fined and to have goods impounded. The law is clear, but a more humane approach at times would be welcome. My party has suggested the people affected should have the right to receive in writing an explanation of the reasons for which they were stopped so as to prevent recurrences.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I welcome the Bill, and Sinn Féin will consider whether to table amendments on Committee Stage, where appropriate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonHarris" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_423">I thank Senators for the welcome given by all sides of the House to the Bill and their considered contributions on Second Stage. As I have stated previously and as Senators on all sides have reiterated, most of the customs legislation has stood since before the State was founded, in the form of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. That Act has been extensively adapted and amended in the past 140 years. While its provisions are still on the Statute Book, many are redundant or of doubtful validity. From a wider perspective, the complicated and overlapping structure of the resulting legislation can, at times, be difficult to understand. I enjoy Ronald Reagan quotes, but the Government is here to help. There is an onus on all Oireachtas Members to ensure the laws that we pass are accessible, understandable and relevant to our constituents and citizens. The Bill will go some way in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> The Bill's purpose is to repeal, consolidate, revise and modernise customs legislation into a single Act. The new legislation is more in keeping with developments in trade and technology and better reflects the social and political landscape in Ireland. This legislative approach is at the core of the wider better regulation initiative. It will provide greater clarity and transparency and, in doing so, make our legislation more accessible. I hope it will reduce the administrative burden and red tape that is often perceived and encountered by those involved in complying with customs legislation and regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> There are approximately 1.1 million customs declarations per annum, and €277 million in customs duty is collected. This is a sizable amount. The scale and context of the customs operation in modern Ireland necessitate the modernisation of the underlying legislation. I thank Senators for expressing their gratitude to our Revenue and customs officials and the front-line work they do on a daily basis. It is only right and proper that the Houses support them in their work by putting in place modern and relevant legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> On a point of clarification, the figure of 2,000 staff refers to all of the Revenue Commissioners' enforcement operations. I am sure the Customs service would love to have 2,000 staff on its own. I thank the 2,000 staff for the job they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> Senator Tom Sheahan raised a point about how the Bill referred in some places to the need for a warrant but, in others, to there being no need for a warrant. To clarify, the measures where a warrant is not needed refer to those under which actions are taken in a customs-controlled environment, such as an airport or port. The measures where a warrant is needed refer to the standard procedure of accessing private property or businesses. Persons other than the Revenue Commissioners - this was an important question - means locksmiths, drivers or anyone who will be needed to accompany an official in carrying out his or her function. If the Senator has more concerns about these matters, we can tease them out further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Senators referred to section 20. It is important that the court provide protections for citizens, but customs officers also need protection when carrying out their functions. This is what section 20 endeavours to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Senator Paul Bradford asked for clarity on whether it would be possible for an enforcement officer or inspector to carry out inspections of diesel samples at a depot or anywhere else. The answer is "Yes". Under our excise law, there are extensive powers to carry out such inspections. This is a useful clarification, as the issue always arises in the Seanad in terms of fuel laundering and petrol stretching. It is worth putting on the record the fact that significant additional powers have been made available to tackle these problems. A comprehensive strategy to tackle illegal diesel laundering has been put in place. The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market. A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering. New requirements in respect of fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data were available to assist in supply chain analysis. Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, a new supply chain reporting regime was introduced from January 2013. This requires all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to the Revenue Commissioners of their fuel transactions. The Revenue Commissioners are using these data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for further investigation. There is intensified targeting and co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border in terms of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners has yielded considerable results. The number of oil laundries detected and closed down in the period 2010-14 was 35. None has been detected in 2015 to date. Since mid-2011, 134 filling stations have been closed for breaches of licensing conditions and more than 3 million litres of fuel have been seized. To the end of March this year, two filling stations have been closed down and, to the end of April, 22,205 litres of fuel have been seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Industry sources indicate a much reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption. Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth, but reduced fraud is an important factor. Last year there were four summary convictions and one on indictment for offences related to fuel fraud. In addition, there were 283 summary convictions relating to the detection of marked fuel in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles. I thought it was useful to take that opportunity to update the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Senator Paul Bradford also raised a very important point, which goes well beyond the debate on this legislation but certainly has an impact in the area of customs, namely, the possibility of a UK exit from the European Union. It is well known by all Senators that the Government intends to take a proactive stance in respect of wishing to see Britain remain in the European Union. The Irish Government remained silent on the issue of a Scottish referendum because we were not part of that union. It did not mean that we did not care, but we stayed silent so as not to interfere. We are part of the European Union and, therefore, there is no intention to stay silent on that debate. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has already articulated on a number of occasions the Government's position and its desire that Britain remain within the European Union and has delivered speeches in London on that issue also.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> It is very important that we see what the British Government wishes by way of reform of the European Union. I notice comments regarding a desire to make it easier to do business in Europe and reducing red tape, which are aspirations all European citizens can subscribe to, but it is important that Ireland and all member states see the details in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_434"> It is important to acknowledge in the context of a customs Bill that many of the repercussions for Irish customs if the United Kingdom were to exit from the European Union remain unknown or are speculative at best. The full implications would only be known once the details of any new agreement or arrangement negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union are finalised and published. There is much speculation, but that is all it is, that if the United Kingdom exited the European Union, and we hope it does not, it would enter a European free trade agreement with the European Union, similar to that currently in place for Switzerland and Norway, or enter a customs union with the European Union, similar to that currently in place for Turkey. Regardless of the final agreed position, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union would have significant fiscal and logistical implications for Irish customs and, therefore, it is appropriate that it is raised in the context of this debate. Following the results of the recent UK general election, it now seems certain that there will be a referendum in the United Kingdom on EU membership within the next two years. If the UK public voted to exit the European Union, this would have a significant effect on trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland. The volume of trade country imports into Ireland would double in value. The increase in imports of third country goods and the increase in the volume of exports to third countries would put significant extra pressure on Irish custom resources and infrastructure. This is something we are monitoring very closely. Ireland is willing to play a very constructive role in respect of the debate and the reforms Britain seeks and will approach that debate in a constructive manner, as a neighbour and a friend, but it is important we see the detail. I am sure this is something that this House and, indeed, the other one will consider and debate further in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I thank Senators for their views and their considered response to this legislation. I look forward to Committee Stage, on which we can further tease out this Bill, and to getting this legislation enacted quickly as possible, in order that we can give customs officers the powers they need and deserve to effectively deliver the customs and excise system citizens expect.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I apologise for the delay as I was responding to a debate in the Dáil. I am pleased to address Members of the Seanad on my new role within the Department of Health, aligned to my responsibilities in the Departments of Justice and Equality and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in regard to the national drugs strategy. I wish to update the House on my priorities in advancing this agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I am delighted to be afforded the opportunity to undertake this role. I see it as a vital role that needs the attention of a dedicated Minister. My experience as a teacher and principal in Dublin's north inner city taught me all about the horrors of drug abuse and the need to tackle the effects that it can have on the individual, their families and communities. I am deeply committed to doing all I can, as Minister of State, to reduce the damage that drug use causes to individuals and to wider Irish society. Problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing our country. It results in damaging consequences for the individual concerned and for their families and it also impacts the wider community and society on multiple levels. Directly or indirectly, every community is affected by drug abuse and addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Those struggling with drug problems are often the most marginalised in our society. They may have multiple, complex and interlocking needs such as poverty, housing, poor health and education, which require multiple interventions involving a range of different agencies. Consequently, the national drugs strategy aims to promote inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area. Its overall objective is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars, which are: supply reduction; prevention; treatment; rehabilitation; and research. The strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Departments and agencies, in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors. We are beginning work on a successor to the current strategy, about which I will speak in more detail later.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The national drugs prevalence survey 2010-11 provided key data on drug prevalence in Ireland. For example, levels of illegal drug use were mainly stable in Ireland between 2006-07 and 2010-11. Some 7% of all adults reported using any illegal drug in the year prior to the survey; cannabis was the most commonly used illegal drug and 6% of all adults reported using the drug in the year prior to the survey; 6.5% reported using sedatives and tranquillisers in the year prior to the survey; and 5% reported using anti-depressants in the same period. This survey is currently being repeated and the information gathered will inform future policy direction and contribute to the development of the new strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Unfortunately, because of the nature of the particular issue, we do not have good data on heroin usage in Ireland. The national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol is undertaking a survey which will provide us with useful estimates of heroin usage. Even without this data, I am satisfied that heroin represents a substantial element of our drugs problem and I am determined to find the most effective ways to address this scourge.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The scale and nature of the drug problem in Ireland is constantly evolving. We need to maintain our focus on combating this serious problem. It is also useful to acknowledge some areas where significant progress has been made in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem. The social, personal and health education programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drug and alcohol issues in schools. I know from my own experience as a teacher and principal that maximising school completion rates is central to the prevention of potential problem drug and alcohol use. In addition, research shows that having a positive experience of school and learning is a major protective factor that reduces the risk of substance use.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> As well as providing substance use education in schools, young people at risk of drug misuse are supported through diversionary programmes providing facilities and services and are offered family support. Very significant investment is being made in the Garda youth diversion programme. It seeks to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour, including drug-related crime, and in preventing their succumbing to drug misuse. My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently announced that an additional €2.8 million has been secured under dormant assets funding. The funding will enable a further ten new Garda youth diversion projects to be established in targeted areas. This will bring to 110 the total number of youth diversion projects in operation nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Achieving improved health outcomes for people with addiction issues is a key priority in the HSE service plan for 2015. In recent years, the HSE has placed a particular emphasis on ensuring appropriate treatment services are provided, on a timely basis, for service users. Waiting times for access to services, particularly outside Dublin, have been considerably reduced. At the end of December 2014, over 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, while 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week. Additional funding of €2.1 million has been provided in the HSE's budget for 2015, which includes an additional 53 beds, creating 439 new treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> There is now comprehensive coverage of needle exchange services across the country. The expansion of needle exchange outside Dublin, with the support of funding from the Elton John Aids Foundation, has resulted in the recruitment and training of over 130 community pharmacies. I recently attended a presentation by the HSE on how this programme is operated and I was impressed by the success of the initiative to date. In fact, during 2014 over 42,000 packs which contained over 240,000 needles were given out.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Approximately 9,800 people are availing of opioid substitution treatment. The number of new entrants to treatment, whose main problem drug is heroin, is in decline. However, in recent years the rise in polydrug use, including alcohol and prescription medication, has become an increasing cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I welcome the HSE-led project on naloxone which was launched in recent days. Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone in some overdoses. This innovative project involves training lay persons such as the family and friends of a drug user, in the administration of a naloxone injection to overdose victims. Research shows that providing increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose is an effective way of reducing overdose deaths. I have no doubt that lives will be saved as a result of this initiative. Every drug-related death is a tragedy for the families and friends of the person involved and has a considerable impact on communities and society as a whole. The provision of naloxone to those most at risk and their families is a real step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> We also need to consider the introduction of medically supervised injecting rooms. There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere. This creates a public nuisance and is unhygienic and unsafe for drug users. There are supervised injecting facilities in a number of other countries and it is a policy I am very interested in. Last week, I received a draft legislative proposal from Ana Liffey and the Bar Council's voluntary assistance scheme which would allow for the provision of such services. I welcome the initiative and I have asked my officials to examine the practical and legal issues surrounding the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> A longitudinal drug treatment outcome study measuring the effectiveness of opioid treatment, called the Research Outcome Study in Ireland or ROSIE study, showed that drug treatment works. Significant reductions are shown in the key outcome areas of drug use, involvement in crime and in injecting drug use.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> In terms of drug supply reduction, the drug market and associated crime has a particularly corrosive impact on Irish communities, whether that is by virtue of gangland crime and related murders or through the intimidation imposed on local communities by those involved in drug crime. Our criminal justice agencies continue to play a significant role in seeking to address the many challenges faced in tackling such drug-related criminal activity. Our law enforcement response in targeting those involved in drug trafficking remains an important feature of our overall approach in addressing the drugs issue. The continued disruption of the supply of illicit drugs remains a key priority area which is reflected in the Garda Síochána's policing plan for 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Work in this area is being led by the recently merged Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The bureau works with dedicated drug units across the country and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau and targets those involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> The specific strategies put in place by An Garda Síochána to address drug supply include the operation of targeted intelligence-led initiatives focused on particular aspects of the drugs trade. A further feature of our policing response is An Garda Síochána's ongoing close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners' Customs service and with other national drug law enforcement agencies such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in tackling drug supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> At an international level, An Garda Síochána has strategic partnerships in place targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol. Last November, I was delighted to attend and speak at a successful major global conference that was held in Dublin which focused on tackling pharmaceutical crime. The conference was jointly hosted by Interpol, An Garda Síochána and the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> In addition, the national drugs strategy includes a number of specific actions which target related aspects of drug crime. For example, the problem of drug-related threats and intimidation has been the subject of increasing concern. The Government is determined to tackle this form of criminality which has a detrimental effect on families, communities and society as a whole. Under the strategy, a framework for tackling this particular problem has been put in place by An Garda Síochána. The drug-related intimidation programme has been established by the Garda national drugs unit in conjunction with the community based national family support network. The purpose of this programme is to respond to the needs of drug users, their family members and-or friends who experience drug-related intimidation to repay drug debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> While good progress has been made, much work remains to be done. Problem drug users are individuals with their own individual needs. We must focus on their health needs and continue to promote the recovery of problem drug users, help them reintegrate into society and reach their full potential. This means services having a common vision on recovery and working together through a client-centred approach to foster client progression.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> All services need to get behind the national drugs rehabilitation framework which is being rolled out across the country, with the support of the drug and alcohol task forces. The framework aims to ensure a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a client centred approach to rehabilitation across the spectrum of services and based on shared care planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Drug misuse is associated with a wide array of negative physical and mental health outcomes that are exacerbated with advancing age. Ireland has an ageing population of people in opiate substitution treatment. The needs of this cohort pose unique challenges for services and underline the need for joined-up interagency working.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> In 2012, there were 633 drug-related deaths in Ireland, which is a small decline in the overall number of drug-related deaths when compared with the 2011 figures. The number of deaths in which heroin was involved also continues to decline. Nevertheless, drug-related deaths still remain at an unacceptable level and every death is a tragedy. Evidence shows that those who are out of treatment are approximately three times more likely to die than those who are stable in treatment. Accordingly, we need to redouble our efforts to get people into treatment and on a recovery pathway.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Alcohol causes significant damage across the population, in workplaces, to children and creates a substantial burden on all in Irish society. The Government is committed to taking action to protect the health and well-being of the wider public, especially children, from alcohol use. A comprehensive and detailed package of measures has been approved to address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill was published last February and the Bill is being drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The Minister for Health intends to have the Bill before the summer recess and to introduce it in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn. The legislation is the most far-reaching proposed by any Irish Government, with alcohol being addressed for the first time as a public health measure. The Bill is part of a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption, as set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is leading the implementation of this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> In March this year, the Minister for Health brought forward emergency legislation to deal with an adverse Court of Appeal decision regarding the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The purpose of this Act is to prevent the misuse of dangerous or otherwise harmful substances, and it does so by declaring substances to be controlled under the Act and then imposing a range of controls on substances depending on their therapeutic or other value and their potential for misuse. The type of control provided for includes controls on possession, supply, importation and exportation, cultivation, licensing, administration, record-keeping, prescription-writing, destruction and safe custody of controlled drugs. The Act also establishes offences and penalties for non-compliance. Substances may be controlled by two mechanisms: either by being listed in the Schedule to the Act, or by being declared controlled by means of a Government order made under section 2(2). It was this section which the Court of Appeal ruling declared unconstitutional. The court found that while it was appropriate for the Oireachtas to delegate the power to the Government to declare substances to be controlled, the Act did not offer sufficient guidance to the Government in its exercise of this power. The ruling had the effect of decontrolling all substances that had been controlled by Government order, including ecstasy, new psychoactive substances and benzodiazepines. This meant it was no longer an offence to possess these substances. The Oireachtas passed emergency legislation on 11 March to restore the controls on such substances by placing these in the Schedule to the Act. In addition, emergency legislation, namely the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, confirmed a number of ministerial orders and regulations made under the Act. This means that those orders and regulations are as if they were an Act of the Oireachtas and cannot be amended or revoked without primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> My aim in the coming months is to bring forward another Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to control substances anew, thereby meeting our EU and international obligations to control substances that are dangerous and have the potential for abuse. Furthermore, the Bill will clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made. This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, to impose stricter or less strict controls on substances which are already covered under the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will be leading the development of the drugs strategy for the period after 2016. My intention in the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused policy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions. The other consideration is the optimum timeframe for the new strategy, bearing in mind the evolving nature of the drugs phenomenon. This work will include an assessment of the extent to which the current strategy has provided an effective policy response to the drug problem. An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches that might be considered in an Irish context. I intend to consult widely and to meet all groups and stakeholders concerned with the drugs issue. I want to listen to the concerns of those affected, and I am particularly keen to hear from young people, service users and their families. I also want to hear from Members of this House who have an interest in and concern about this area.</p>

          <from>Senator Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">I wish the Minister of State all the best in his new role, which involves responsibility for drugs. However, given the delivery of his 16-page speech and the fact it was printed beforehand, he might as well have posted it out to us and we could have read it at our leisure. I did not see the fire and passion we need and which, in fairness, the Minister of State shows in many other areas. I want him to take my remarks constructively. He displays excellent resolve in many areas and needs to do so in this one. Some original thinking is required. Many of the previous approaches have not worked. If the objective is for us to eliminate illegal drug use, which I presume it is, as a society and a Government we have failed miserably in that. My party was in government for many of those years and I do not exempt us from criticism on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The appointment of the Minister of State was very welcome. It was late, which was not his fault but rather that of the Government. There seemed to be complete forgetfulness in this area. On one of the few occasions on which I saw Leaders' Questions on the television, I saw Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan ask the Taoiseach about a drugs issue. His answer was, essentially, that he would get back to the Deputy. It struck me at the time that for a Taoiseach of the country not to be completely <i>au fait</i> with this area was disappointing, to be quite honest. </p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Earlier this year Fianna Fáil brought forward new policy proposals seeking to address the challenge of the prevalence of drug abuse in society. It is a challenge and there is no point in denying it. The people who advocate legalisation strategies cannot deny that there is a problem. The problem is not simply the illegal distribution of drugs; rather, the problem is the effects many of the illegal drugs have on people in terms of addiction, and the long-term effects some non-addictive drugs appear to have on people. We all know people who smoke a lot of cannabis and - let us be honest - it has an effect on them. The idea that cannabis is a harmless drug or does not cause problems is not correct. We know people who smoke it on a very regular basis and are not fulfilling their normal roles in society, as far as I can see. </p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Fianna Fáil pledged to appoint a Minister for drugs because at the time we saw that there was a clear gap and that a Minister with specific responsibility for this problem was needed. There are also health and justice issues, as well as how we deal with people in communities where drug abuse is rampant. We welcome the fact that the Government has finally appointed the Minister of State. Fianna Fáil is often accused of having no policies, but this was one policy that was adopted. We had such a policy when in government, and we felt it needed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> We want to build on the national drugs strategy and the Minister of State is considering this. We hope it is done relatively quickly. The Minister of State referred to the period after 2016. We want to implement a new national substance misuse strategy which is inclusive of all drugs, including alcohol and cannabis. In fairness to the Minister of State, there was substantial discussion of alcohol in his speech. </p>
          <p eId="para_473"> We need to address anti-social behaviour experienced in cities as a result of drug abuse. Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell famously did a slot on the "Today" show on RTE about O'Connell Street and the difficulties encountered by people walking on it and there is no doubt that a lot of the difficulties are drug-fuelled. Fianna Fáil also believes after-care services need to be improved. There is no point in pretending that things in this area are static. The landscape of drug use in Ireland has changed dramatically and there are emerging needs regarding the nature and prevalence of drug use throughout the country. </p>
          <p eId="para_474"> We once thought heroin was a problem of inner-city Dublin. Everyone's eyes have been opened to the heroin problem. Substance misuse is complex and cuts across other issues, including poverty and a lack of resources in communities. It has a major impact, and the problem can be caused by various social and personal factors. The drugs issue causes other problems. There is a chain reaction. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Alcohol and cannabis misuse is prevalent. I understand alcohol misuse among young people is decreasing overall, about which I am glad, but it may not be enough compared to the situation ten years ago or more. That may have something to do with the financial situation and the price of alcohol. Many people drink less now than they did when economic times were better and perhaps that is good. There seems to have been a lack of urgency on the part of the Government to address the issue, which has resulted in an inadequate response. We would say this was symbolised by the negligence of the Cabinet, which has responsibility for appointing Ministers of State, in appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for dealing with the drugs problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">A former Fianna Fáil Minister, Mr. Pat Carey, helped to tie things together between different Departments and agencies in order to bring forward a strategy. </p>
          <p eId="para_477"> My party has published its national drugs action plan, but I was not involved in its production as I was not the spokesperson on drugs at the time. My colleagues who produced the plan had extensive consultation with various groups. My colleague Senator Darragh O'Brien is chairman of the drugs task force on the north side of Dublin; he has, therefore, great experience of this issue. My colleagues spoke to the groups who are working to tackle the abuse of drugs at community level. People had an overwhelming sense that the drugs crisis had slipped off the Government's agenda. I encourage the Minister of State to show the same passion he has displayed when debating other issues such as asylum seekers. His personal commitment to the marriage equality referendum has been second to none. On certain issues he might not get the result that he wants from the Cabinet. I ask him to give a personal commitment to tackle this issue, because he is capable of making changes and getting a better response from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> My party's first proposal was to appoint a Minister with responsibility for drugs. Communication between the various services in the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality, social services, Tusla, local government and community services can be conducted on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, and services often operate in isolation. There is a genuine and urgent need for political leadership, which the Minister of State has the potential to provide, in order to create workable structures and to close the gap that has emerged between the Government, which is the maker of policy, and the providers on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> There is an escalating crisis in polydrug use and the increasing use of cannabis. I do not favour any legalisation of cannabis, even in other forms, because it changes one's personality.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> As the Minister of State has mentioned, the sale and abuse of prescription drugs has infiltrated communities across the country. I have a lot more to say on drugs, but I only have eight minutes. Let us be clear. The Minister of State has an important role to play. Other matters have gone off the agenda because they have been dealt with. It is now time for him to grasp this nettle and do what he can. I urge him to get his house in order, get the strategy laid down and get the agencies to work together to curb drug abuse. The problem is increasing in areas where it would not have been in existence ten years ago. Heroin use is a relatively static phenomenon but it has caused huge problems for a lot of people. The drugs landscape has changed so much, as the Minister of State acknowledged in his speech. My party will support him once he is seen to be tackling the issue and making a genuine effort.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_481">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the work that he has done in this area. I compliment him on the way he has dealt with the media. He has conveyed a positive message on the new approach being taken to tackle this issue. We need a new approach to certain ways we have of dealing with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Let us look at an interesting study produced by the European School Survey Project, which interviewed 2,200 children aged under 16 years and found that 19% of them reported using an illicit drug in their lifetime. The figure is quite high, but it is still lower than the figure of 22% obtained from a similar survey. The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, NACDA, also carried out research which showed that 27% of participants reported using illegal drugs in their lifetime. The percentage was broken down into the following categories: in the 25 to 34 age group, 42% of participants confirmed they had used illicit drugs; in the 35 to 44 age group, it was 29%; and in the 15 to 24 age group, it was 27%. Those figures highlight the fact that there is an important job to be done in education and trying to steer people away from ever touching illicit drugs. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The national drugs strategy 2009 to 2016 sets out 63 objectives and we have made progress in these areas. The five pillars of the strategy are supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. </p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The Joint Committee on Health and Children recently heard a presentation on drug addition and recovery. One of the speakers was a project leader from a HSE-run project in Dublin. He talked about the principles that reflect recovery and said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_485">Recovery is self-directed and empowering. Recovery involves a personal recognition of the need for change and transformation. Recovery involves rejoining and rebuilding life in the community. Recovery involves addressing discrimination and transcending shame and stigma.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Those are some of the issues that need to be highlighted. Recovery for a person who has a drug problem, which involves personal recognition of the need for change and transformation, requires a lot of support. When people arrive at that stage, a large number of them know that abstaining from drugs is the way they want to go, but it is difficult for them to succeed unless they have support. A survey of 1,007 drug users in Scotland showed that 56.6% identified abstinence as their main aspiration. To achieve that they need every bit of support, not only from friends, but from family and the health service also.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> An interesting report entitled Addiction Recovery: A Contagious Paradigm! was presented to the Joint committee on Health and Children in 2014. I shall quote one of the people cited in the report, who said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_488">I saw the good life of those in recovery, began to buy into the process. ... Started to put on iPod and had a watch the time going to clinic and avoid speaking to others who were using drugs. I started seeing a counsellor, talking about self, stuff and family (once per week). Starting going out walking to mountains with non-using friends, every fortnight for full day. I also played soccer every Monday night. Began to write, keeping a diary.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">He continued by stating the supports he received were the key to his recovery. The report just shows that we need to ensure support services are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> In the national drugs strategy 2009 to 2016 we set out 63 objectives, but we need to continue to review the processes that are in place and see what changes must be made. The Minister of State has already identified a number of changes to be made in the comprehensive speech that he delivered here this evening, which were also mentioned in his broadcasts. </p>
          <p eId="para_491"> It is important that we look at alternatives. I was approached by one of the people who provide alternatives to methadone. We have had a high reliance on methadone as a heroin substitute and as a way to get people out of their difficulties. I apologise, but I cannot pronounce the name of the alternative drug that is available. </p>

          <p eId="para_495">Suboxone, yes; my apologies. An expert group recommended that Suboxone be introduced, but we need a change in legislation first.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Amending legislation will be necessary to allow it to be used. There are advantages in using the product as opposed to methadone. It has been tested and there is a reduced risk of misuse, overdose and death. It is unlikely to be diverted as a street drug and it reduces the top-up use of heroin. My figures are from 2012, when the latest data on drug related deaths implicated methadone in 86 deaths, be it alone or with another drug. They also noted that 68% of those who died in similar circumstances in 2011 accessed diverted methadone illegally, as they were not in treatment at the time. While methadone has been effective, there comes a time to consider its alternatives. Will amending legislation be introduced in 2015 and is it likely to be in place during this Government's lifetime?</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The Minister of State has outlined what he intends to do in terms of supervision and access to facilities. These are welcome developments, but we must always consider new ways of dealing with this matter. We should highlight the importance of education, be it in schools, youth clubs or sport clubs, in outlining the dangers involved in using any type of illicit drug.</p>

Nílim ag fáil lochta ar an Aire Stáit, ach ag fáil lochta ar leagan amach na hoibre.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> This is a complex issue. I have first-hand experience of dealing with drug and alcohol addiction close to home. It is not just a question of dealing with the addiction, but also the societal, familial and economic issues involved. The national drugs strategy has been running since 2009 and is to conclude in 2016. While it aims to cut across public policy and service delivery to tackle the drug problem, it is recognised by many as having failed to achieve that in any meaningful way. The numbers of those addicted to heroin is increasing and drug related deaths have increased by 50% in the past decade. At a joint policing committee meeting that I attended in Galway yesterday, the superintendent reiterated her concerns about the alarming increase in the misuse of heroin. Ecstasy tablet use everywhere has also increased. A councillor who was a taxi driver stated that he regularly had to clear ecstasy tablets out of the back of his cab on Saturday evenings. This indicates how much misuse there has been among our young people. The terrible and tragic death of Ana Hick in Dublin recently indicates that drugs are available not just in Galway, Dublin and so on, but also in any rural town that has a disco on a Saturday night. One is probably likely to find that some drugs are available quite handily to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> When one understands that funding to local drugs task forces has been cut by almost 80% in the past five years, the reasons for these issues, as well as the societal issues, become clear. In rural areas in recent years, health, support and social services have been cut back drastically. This has not helped the situation. My colleague, Sinn Féin's health spokesperson, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, recently welcomed the Minister of State's appointment, as did I. Prior to that, we had the unfortunate circumstance of the current Government being the first in 21 years not to have a Minister of State with responsibility for dealing with the drugs problem. However, I must ask what the Minister of State's main priority is, as he also has responsibility for equality, new communities, culture and commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The Minister of State has stated the current national drugs strategy is too old and has lost energy and focus. We are happy with some of his statements so far and that he is willing to engage new methods in the fight against drugs. He stated he would be supportive of the introduction of injection centres for addicts. We should not rush to rule that proposal out before discussing it, as it seems to have some merit. There were issues with the dumping of drug paraphernalia in Galway recently, particularly in Westside, Ballinfoyle and Ballybane. This major problem must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The alternative to injection centres for addicts is a continuation of the current dangers and problems with which we are all too familiar, including carelessly disposed of needles and the health risks of injecting in non-clinical settings. Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, who has met representatives of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, has stated we should be open to discussing the proposition, including its benefits and down sides, and making an informed decision based on all of the facts. I note the Minster of State's comments to the effect that methadone maintenance is not working for a cohort of drug addicts. There are more than 10,000 registered methadone users in the State, a large number; therefore, we must ensure we examine all options. I understand some of those being considered may be more expensive, but perhaps the Minister of State might comment on the small group of people who are receiving suboxone, how they are doing and whether consideration has been given to extending this project. The Minister of State has provided details on naloxone, but perhaps he could give more detail on that project. Naloxone has been made available for prescription to opioid drug users, the aim being to reduce drug related deaths. How will this be monitored and what is its end point?</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Last month, the Minister of State told us that there were a number of addiction counsellor posts vacant in the Dublin region. Where are there vacancies in other regions? What has been done to ensure recruitment?</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children recently agreed to address the issue of legal highs, mindful of the deaths that had occurred consequent on the use of those substances, not only in Ireland but on a European basis. A new strategy must address any legislative loophole and ensure that repeats of inadvertent legalisation do not occur. We as legislators, and the Government in the first instance, must address the damage being done to society by drugs. This problem faces every town and disproportionately affects communities that have been hardest hit by the current and previous Governments' austerity policies. A new national drugs strategy must recognise this and be adequately resourced for its duration so that the number taking drugs, and taken by drugs, does not continue to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Today sees a work to rule in University Hospital Galway by the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, which told me that two of the problems were overcrowding and the pressure on its members as a result of cutbacks in addiction services and so on. Obviously, this is a broad problem. I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts to tackle it, but I am concerned that he has a great deal on his plate.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I welcome the Minister of State and his appointment to this new role with responsibility for the national drugs strategy. That appointment is positive and the Minister of State brings immense commitment to the matter, given his personal experience as a teacher and principal in an area that had a significant drug problem and as a Labour Party colleague. I am glad that he has this role. I welcome the initiatives that have been taken and on which he has addressed the House, particularly those relating to SPHE, youth diversion projects, the extra funding for same and the interagency approach that has been adopted in the national drugs strategy and will be continued in the new strategy for the period after 2016. The Minister of State mentioned that, if we run out of time in this debate, he would be glad to return at a future date. It is an issue on which many of us have strong views and the Minister of State brings a passion to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> We are conscious of the harm caused by drugs. The Minister of State mentioned a figure of 633 drug related deaths in 2012. From my background as a criminal justice practitioner who has represented many people before the criminal courts down through the years and often defended people with serious opiate addiction problems, I am well aware of the harm that can be caused by the misuse of drugs, but we need to bring to the debate on a national drugs strategy a measured and rational approach that is based on a harm reduction model.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I am glad to hear the Minister of State that say he is looking at evidence-based approaches that have been taken in other jurisdictions, because that is something we need to consider in devising a new national drugs strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> There are three things I would like to see us adopt in the new national drugs strategy. We need to treat addiction as a medical problem, a health problem predominantly, and not a criminal justice problem. From the Minister of State's speech and from our knowledge of the area, we would be very conscious that this is the case on the ground and that we have, as others have said, about 10,000 people on opiate substance programmes administered by the HSE. We recognise that addiction is a medical issue. I am glad to hear the Minister of State speak about the expansion of the needle exchange programme and I absolutely support him on the idea of the medically supervised injecting rooms. That is a hugely positive development in dealing with the harms associated with addiction. "Positive" is perhaps the wrong word to use in the context, but it would certainly be an improvement on the sort of street injecting that causes other problems around public order, intimidation of the public, and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> We also need to look in a rational sense at the way in which certain drugs that are controlled, particularly cannabis, may be used for medicinal purposes. There is a growing debate on this internationally. I have spoken to the Minister of State about this and I know of many people who, for example, have small children with very serious medical conditions which they believe can be improved or better managed through medical marijuana. We have seen a great deal of use of that and its development in the United States. I would like to develop that conversation with the Minister of State, because we should not be fearful about it. If there is an evidence-based rationale for prescribing cannabis or a cannabinoid for medical reasons, we should look at that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> We need to look more broadly at our drugs policy from a harm reduction perspective. I am glad to say that other members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am also a member, will be travelling to Lisbon in June, in a few weeks time, to look at the model that has been adopted in Portugal. This is of great interest as an alternative model very much based on harm reduction, as opposed to the prohibitionist model with which we are, unfortunately, more familiar. I have said before that if we use a sort of "Boston-Berlin" argument about policies generally on the economy and society, then in Ireland we clearly follow a Boston model on drugs. That is unfortunate because it is based on the simple, crude and wildly unrealistic idea that criminal law can stop people from using drugs. In other words, if drug possession is a criminal offence, this will deter people from taking drugs and eliminate drug use. We know this prohibitionist approach does not work. The war on drugs has not stopped people using drugs, just as asking people to abstain from sex will not prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases or HIV. We must take a more realistic and rational evidence-based approach to this. The Berlin model, which is more common in some European jurisdictions, recognises that the elimination of drug use is impossible. It seeks instead to reduce or prevent the harms that can arise from drug use, through medical means predominantly rather than through criminal law. This involves taking on the approaches the Minister of State talked about through seeking to educate people about the dangers associated with harmful drug use.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> We also need to acknowledge the class issue in terms of drug use. This is rarely spoken about but is very obvious for any criminal justice practitioner. Broadly, in any society, there are two groups of drug users: those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more likely to be criminalised for their drug use, and middle class users, who use drugs recreationally and who tend to go undetected and remain outside the criminal law. We see that class difference in Ireland broadly and tragically holding true for the consequences of drug-taking. Heroin addiction has caused terrible tragedy and devastation within many disadvantaged communities, but middle class ecstasy and cocaine use does not have, or certainly has not been perceived to have, those terrible social and economic consequences in different societies. This phenomenon is not exclusive to drug offences. I have written more generally about class in the criminal justice system, because we know there is a deep-rooted class bias in the criminal justice system more generally. However, it is important that any rational drugs policy would take into account the class difference and the fact that there are different means of using drugs and different sorts of harm caused by the use of drugs. Also, from a criminal justice perspective, we must all be very conscious of the huge harm caused by the criminalisation of drugs, the growth of criminal gangs and the huge damage done to communities by the prevalence of those criminal gangs. That is another reason to look in a more rational and measured way at how we develop drug policy in Ireland. I hope the Minister of State will take some of those comments and concerns on board in working with other agencies and Departments on devising the new national drugs strategy for the period after 2016. I look forward to working with him on it.</p>

          <from>Senator James Heffernan<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_513">I congratulate the Minister of State on the excellent result of the marriage equality referendum at the weekend and his efforts in that regard. I also welcome his new role as Minister of State with responsibility for dealing with the drugs problem. I was heartened to see the frank, open and honest interview he gave on national television a few weeks ago. It was a breath of fresh air into this debate. I am glad he seems to be the right man for the job. The issue of drugs in our society is quite big. It can often go under the radar and it is something that many of us in Leinster House are a bit afraid of talking about. Talking about drugs and other issues and dealing with them can often be seen as a big taboo. Raising the issue and proposing a debate on alternative ways to deal with drugs, recreational drugs in particular, is something that might not be seen as very popular in constituencies. However, it is a debate that needs to be had.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Drugs are in our society, about which there is no doubt. They have become part and parcel of our society. For many people, they are part and parcel of every weekend. I know how obvious it was to me. Coming back to a small area, one can see people on drugs. When out and about on weekends, some people are in and out of the pub as they would be to smoke a cigarette. They are out taking lines or whatever else. It has become a very common occurrence. Most of the people I have been meeting and dealing with are sensible, smart, progressive and forward-thinking. Often we are seen in this House as being far behind the times. Brushing something under the carpet and pretending it is not there is not the way to go. Drugs are no longer the preserve of the <i>hoi polloi </i>and while the likes of celebrity overdoses - Katy French, Gerry Ryan and others - hit the headlines, often the young people who overdose, and there has been an alarming increase in that recently, do not seem to get as much attention. I know of two deaths in Clonroche in Wexford recently. The death of Ana Hick has been mentioned by previous speakers, and Michael Coleman, Liam Coffey and others also come to mind. They took an alternative drug to MDMA with the same effect, which is called PMMA and is a very dangerous drug. It is something about which people need to be educated.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Part of the problem is that the control and supply of drugs is now in the hands of ruthless criminal organisations which do not give a damn about what they are selling, who they are selling it to and the consequences. These are my thoughts from what I see happening on the ground. Criminalisation has failed miserably. I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik on that issue. It has not reduced the demand and therefore, in economic parlance, it has not reduced the supply. From the IFSC to the more rural parishes, there are people taking drugs. Anyone living in the real world can see this. It has become tolerated and accepted in my generation and the younger generation. In a group of friends, it is often the case that some people will smoke the odd joint, others take cocaine and others speed, some take pills, some take all of these substances, while some do not take any. Half the craic for young people when they start taking drugs is that they are illegal and there is a criminal risk attached to it. If that were changed, it would reduce the allure for many young people and those with an inquisitive mind. As has been said, we need investment in education programmes. We must give people the proper information on drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">We need to explain openly, frankly and honestly the pros and cons of different drugs and their good and bad effects. Then we should allow people to make up their own minds, take whatever risk they want and put whatever they want to into their own bodies. It would be far better if the control, supply and sale of these substances were in the hands of trained medical professionals acting on the State’s behalf rather than in the hands of the 13-year-old young fellow I happened to meet outside a popular Dublin pub several weeks ago. He was completely, totally and utterly off his face, with huge wads of cash in his possession and a real fancy top-of-the-range mobile phone. He did not know where he was and was very frightened, looking for help.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The damage criminal organisations are doing to our society, as the Minister of State outlined, is very hard to qualify. My brother worked in a disadvantaged school in Moyross, County Limerick. In such an area, when a young fellow sees the economic benefit from the sale of drugs, that is how they get caught up in it. My brother remarked to me that nine of his past pupils were lost to gangland violence. That does not count the number of families affected. I would prefer the State to control this business rather than the Dundons, the McCarthys, paramilitaries or other criminal mafia gangs that operate in this country. The fact this now comes under the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> With regard to what Senator Thomas Byrne said about cannabis users, the problem is-----</p>

          <p eId="para_522">A debate on more lenient drug policies based on speculation and fear-mongering rather than empirical evidence is not positive. In Portugal, a standard-bearer when it comes to drugs policy, decriminalisation has not increased drug use. Anyone who analyses Portugal’s ten-year experiment in decriminalisation would learn much, as well as from policy in Colorado and other states or countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I will not even take five minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I congratulate the Minister of State on the tremendous success in the referendum at the weekend. I saw his joy in the RDS. It was palpable and great to see. He did a great job, as did his party, on which he is to be congratulated. I stood with the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, on Leeson Street Bridge canvassing. Fair play to him - he stopped the poor unfortunate pedestrians on a day the Luas had stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The Minister of State has been given what I believe is the poisoned chalice of dealing with drugs strategy. Anyone who has been unfortunate enough to spend a night in an accident and emergency department - God knows I have spent enough of them there myself with the old ticker every now and then - will have seen the unfortunates affected by drugs. I do not believe there is a way to tackle the drugs problem other than to take it out of the hands of the warlords and drugs lords who are making massive money from it and killing one another to get control over it. The only way I ever see us solving this problem is by tackling it - by legalising it and, in some way, controlling it from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Over two years prior to my coming into the House, I had the privilege of visiting schools all over the country. Without a doubt, there are drug pushers sitting outside the gates of some second level schools waiting for the kids to come out. That is where we need to tackle them. Knowing the Minister of State’s background, I know that he will take it on.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-05-26T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_530">I thank Members for their good wishes and the constructive comments most Senators made. My commitment was questioned, however, and the manner of my delivery was criticised. I promise to work on this in the future. I always know when somebody has very little to say about a topic; they tend to focus on the Minister’s delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Unfortunately, it is not just outside the school gates that there tends to be some drug dealing going on but within the schools too. We have to be mindful of the stresses and strains that teachers are constantly undergoing in this regard. On the glamorous lifestyle that seems to be attached to the drugs trade, as I have often said, if one locks a child out of mainstream society and they do not get respect from it, they will find a parallel economy and a way of getting empowerment and prestige. The drugs trade is glamorous, lucrative and exciting, and gets one cheap and easy money. There is a challenge in the education system and in wider society to tackle this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Senator Colm Burke asked about the use of Suboxone to treat drug addiction. There is not a legislative blockage as such, but we will need regulations because we are dealing with a small cohort of people for whom Suboxone is being prescribed. Further regulations will be needed in the Bill to expand on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> There has been a reduction in funding for the local drugs task forces, but nowhere near 80%. <i>The Irish Times</i> clarified that this was not the case. It has been 9.8% in the past nine years. While no one wants to defend such a reduction, it is the reality of what the entire country went through for several years. In fact, every drugs task force got an extra €48,000 this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I concur with Senator Ivana Bacik about putting the emphasis on harm reduction. It is welcome that the justice committee is going to Portugal. Portugal had a different approach when it came to decriminalising drugs. When I use that term, I want to make it clear that I am not talking about legalisation. Those are two very different things. We have to come back to the research and wonder why 70% of those going through the courts for drugs offences were found in possession of amounts for personal use. This seems to be a complete waste of Garda time and the time of the Courts Service. It is primarily a health issue for those with addictions or problems, not a criminal justice issue, and that is the way in which it should be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The issue of class was raised. In my experience, drugs are everywhere. Neither is it just a Dublin issue. It affects other urban centres and rural areas. As I have said before, middle-class families have ways of hiding drug addiction and drug problems in a way that working-class people sometimes cannot. Drug gangs get their funding from middle-class recreational drug takers who think there is absolutely no connection between their recreational drug use at the weekend and a dead body found in a pool of blood with a gunshot wound to the head or a heroin baby born with an addiction problem. There is obviously a link. When one takes recreational drugs, then one is feeding that menace.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I appreciate the support for the suggestion of consumption rooms. I know that people will have concerns around how they will manifest themselves and be operated. If one examines what happens in Sydney and the 88 such centres across Europe, it is an approach to the cohort of drugs users who are so desperate that they will inject heroin in an alleyway or the stairwell of a flats complex. Recently, I took a 45-minute walk around Dublin city centre with the Ana Liffey Drug Project, which advocates this new approach. We did not have to walk very far to see all the paraphernalia of drug taking, syringes and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">What gardaí, those working with drug addicts, the addicts themselves and even the retailers working in the city centre will say is that this is not good for anybody. It is not good for the image of the city and it certainly is not good for the individuals to have to reduce themselves to a position where they feel they have nowhere else to go for their medical need, for their addiction, than down a side alley to inject themselves. Should we not find some new approach to that small enough cohort of people who do not fit the criteria to go into a mainstream programme for treatment and, in this way, facilitate them to do what they do in a more dignified fashion as a step toward recovery? I think it is worthy of assessment and investigation, and it is something I am determined to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> This House has a good reputation for coming together collectively and on a cross-party basis to focus on issues such as direct provision and other issues of common intent. If this House was to come together collectively and on a cross-party basis and say this is something that should be investigated, this would stop it being a political football and we could take a practical approach to those most vulnerable of drug users who are most inclined to get involved in anti-social behaviour, burglary, muggings and all the rest of it because their need is so great.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> We have a fantastic opportunity at this time, as a collective, due to the redrafting of the national drugs strategy. There should be a shorter timeframe for the next strategy because seven years is too long and perhaps a five-year strategy would be better the next time. Given the Misuse of Drugs Act is being amended in the Dáil, this means we have a number of windows of opportunity through which we can force these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I would appreciate the opportunity to come back to this House to toss these issues around, as I have done on other issues. I have been asked whether I am too busy. I do not think anybody is too busy to deal with the drugs crisis and the drugs issues we have in this country. I do not think we can say the situation is worse or better; it is just different. The drugs issue changes drastically all the time. The age cohorts are different; we have lost a generation to heroin and the people are now older. The needs are different and the type of drug use is different, with polydrug use now common. The complication with alcohol is different and the type of drinking being done is different.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> If drugs are changing, we have to change our approach. The "just say no" approach will work for some people, including children, and we can frighten some children away from drug use completely. However, it does not work for everybody. We have to accept that and work on issues that may actually achieve something. The approaches in Portugal and in Sydney may be something we could look at but we have to get beyond the idea of calling people who have a medical need by a nickname, calling them junkies and assuming they are just human litter, and that as long as we push them away and do not see them, the problem is solved. I do not believe that. If we believe in a republic, and we all now believe in equality, the person who is injecting in the side alley in Dublin city centre, or in any town or part of this country, is as equal a citizen as any of the rest of us and deserves the dignity of having the State help him or her through what is obviously a medical need. I do not believe the criminal justice system is the best way to do this. I appreciate the comments made by Senators and I am happy to come back to the House at any time to flesh out these issues.</p>
