          <p eId="para_7">Yesterday the Minister for Finance promised something for everyone in the budget and he certainly delivered in that regard. He ensured pain for the poor, more cuts for the squeezed middle and more fear for the elderly. Deputy Donnelly in an interview on "Morning Ireland" this morning said that the Government has introduced a politically strong but economically weak budget and he was right.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">It is buying votes with borrowed money and that is a fact. The Government is also helping what could be seen as Fine Gael core voters, but not Labour Party core voters. Those who are earning €70,000 per annum are four times better off in cash terms than those earning the minimum wage, although I am sure the Labour Party would like to see the latter group voting for them in the next general election.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I would like a debate on corporate tax policy. The Government has announced it will get rid of what is known as the "double Irish". Europe is delighted, however the countries that were complaining about our corporate tax policy continue to have the Channel Islands, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. The Dutch have a corporation tax and copyright policy that is the shame of the world. Luxembourg was highlighted last week. Our Government has got rid of the double Irish despite the fact that EU treaties state that every country is entitled to its own corporate tax policy. The Government has introduced this new knowledge development box, subject to EU approval - terms and conditions apply of course. It is talking double Dutch while getting rid of the double Irish.</p>

When I hear him speaking about the budget, it seems he was not listening to what was said in the budget speeches in the Dáil or in the very substantive debate we had in this House last night. Had he been listening, as I was, or contributing, he might have noted that the commentators, like him, who said it was both auction politics and a continuation of austerity, had clearly got it wrong. It could not be both, and it was neither.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">Nobody is being triumphalist over it. However, it represents real progress, particularly for low-income to middle-income earners. If one examines, as objective commentators have done, the impact of the changes to the USC and tax bands, one will see the people who will benefit are the low-income to middle-income earners, whom the budget was specifically designed to help.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> We had a good debate last night. Some very fair and constructive comments were made by both sides. However, the bulk of the criticism was that the budget had not gone far enough, for example that we had not done enough on child care or increased spending in certain areas. While those were fair criticisms, it is unfair to suggest the budget was some kind of giveaway or auction politics or that it represented continued austerity. Clearly, it does not. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was very clear in his speech that it signals an end to the era of austerity, and we are all very glad to see it.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">It added to the positive feelings most people felt last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I welcome other positive news that was, perhaps, lost in yesterday’s budget, namely that, for the first time, Ireland has been invited to participate in the British Armistice day event and that our ambassador in Britain, Dan Mulhall, will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Sunday, 9 November. This is a very welcome development and marks the contribution by 200,000 Irish men and women who went to Britain during the First World War and whose deaths had largely gone unmarked here for far too long. It is important that we are participating in it. In this context, I ask the Leader for a debate in the week that follows it in November, when there will be commemorations of the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, on the decade of commemorations. I also welcome the increased funding in the budget that will pay for the commemorations. We might have the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys here for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> I commend the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, which will have an all-Ireland conference on midwifery tomorrow. I will be glad to address it on pregnancy pathways. Many of us have been concerned about the recent case of Philomena Canning, the withdrawal of insurance indemnity for a midwife involved in supporting women in home births and the lack of choice for women in terms of options in giving birth in hospitals. I was among those who participated in the show of support outside Leinster House last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">Echoing what Senator Bacik said, today “Morning Ireland” reported that the financial pages carried the headline, “Irish recovery stuns Germans” and the sports pages carried the headline, “Irish recovery stuns Germans”. In his speech to the Dáil yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin said the reform agenda must continue. We still have too many unreformed institutions. Although we have done much heavy lifting, the reform agenda must continue. I congratulate the Leader on the fact that a man from his city, John O’Shea, scored the noble equaliser in Germany. We congratulate him. The Northern Ireland team won its match yesterday and is top of its group. It was a very important night in Irish sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I welcome, as Senator Bacik has, the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that he has accepted the invitation to the Armistice day event. It strengthens the improvement in relations, as manifested in events such as the Orange Order and Queen Elizabeth coming to Ireland and President Higgins visiting the UK. Some 50,000 Irish people were killed in the First World War. I am very honoured to represent a constituency in which commemorations of 9 November and 11 November have been held every year at a memorial which has approximately 650 names on it in a small Trinity College Dublin community of approximately 1,000 students who lost their lives in the First World War. It is very moving and touching and is part of the continuing reconciliation between the two islands. It is a very important and welcome development. I welcome the invitation and, even more so, the Minister's decision to accept. It brings the relationship between Ireland and Britain to a new high.</p>

          <p eId="para_76"> Below-cost selling has not been tackled in the budget. This is causing great difficulty in the industry and should be looked at prior to Christmas because it is quite evident the major supermarkets are involved in below-cost selling of alcohol, which leads to other social problems and should be tackled. There was no reason for it not to be tackled in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> There is no plan to restore the full free electricity or free phone rental allowances. It would be very welcome to backtrack when it comes to these issues. The free phone rental was a wonderful scheme devised by the late Charles Haughey and it was welcomed by everyone. That was not restored in this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Adding 40 cents to the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes is fine. Everyone who is anti-smoking would agree with that measure. Customs and Excise and the Garda will have to be funded and geared up to prevent further smuggling of illegal cigarettes into the country, which is depriving the Revenue Commissioners of a considerable amount of badly needed money.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> The prescription charge, the abolition of which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, promised in the general election in 2011, has been increased to €2.50. This is a significant charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> On teacher numbers, additional teachers are appointed where there is an increase in the number of pupils, but four teacher schools will be reduced to three teachers, three teacher ones to two and two teacher ones to one if there is no change, which there has not been, in the pupil-teacher ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> Borrowing to pay for this budget, which is a fact, has to be paid for. One would get the impression that somehow the country was not borrowing billions per annum to pay for the loans. One would think the country had reached a stage where we were earning additional money that could be given out. So be it. That is politics. I welcome the retention of the 9% VAT rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> The point is last Saturday was a wake-up call. I do not know if there will be a general election before the next budget - possibly not. This certainly was an election budget. There is no doubt about that. On Friday, the Government parties got the biggest shock-----</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I think I drew enough fire from them yesterday. They may be done with me for one week.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> I welcome the additional funding of more than €10 million for homeless services that was announced in the budget. That is particularly important for the Dublin region where we are facing a very serious homeless crisis in spite of the work of front-line organisations and the Dublin region homeless executive. It is most welcome and will make a real difference for people who are in very severe need. I also welcome the €2.2 billion that was announced for social housing construction over the next three years. An announcement that was not made relates to rent supplement, the budget for it and the current cap on rental values for houses people on social welfare can rent in the private rental market. I am hopeful, because there is an ongoing review of rent supplement, that those limits will be increased once the review is complete. Will the Leader arrange for the Tánaiste to come to the House at some point to discuss rent supplement and the reforms that should perhaps be made in the rent supplement budget?</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I also ask for two other debates. One relates to the announcement, which we discussed last week, of the Central Bank Governor, Professor Honohan on changing the limits on mortgage lending. There is a consultation process under way in respect of that. The House should have an input to that consultation process. There has been a lot of discussion and debate over recent days about this proposed measure and its implications, especially for young people struggling to purchase a home. This is a serious issue that needs to be discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I also ask for a debate on the private rented sector. We are seeing a significant number of people who are trapped in renting and will be for the foreseeable future. They are facing enormous rent increases with no effective limits being put on those rent increases and no effective security of tenure. We are asking people to live long-term in rented housing. We need to be able to provide rented housing that is safe, secure and affordable. Could we have a debate on the private rented sector?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">They voted for the arrangements. We should remember the €203 billion which is our debt at the moment. We should remember that those who are back at work, which I am very glad about, are working for the German and French banks. They are paying off their debts. I find that very aggravating. The sum of €64 billion of that €203 billion was directly related to the banks. That is a huge amount. Of course, expenditure on the Civil Service and so on had mushroomed in the previous ten or 15 years. That was a real problem - endemic through all governments - that needed to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> It is shameful that we are yet again sliding in terms of the amount of money we provide for overseas development aid. We ought to realise that this is a small planet. We are all interconnected. We all have to look after each other. We are listed in the Brookings Institution as a stand-out country because of our contributions. That will not last if we keep cutting the amount. It is down again. It is down to 0.46%. This is a percentage of our income. As the income shrinks, our contribution shrinks. If we have decided we are capable of giving 0.7%, and the Government in 2000 did so decide, and have made brave efforts to get up that level, we should not now be shrinking back from it.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I support Senator Bacik's proposal to have a debate on commemorations at the appropriate time. We have had four or five debates on the commemoration, however, with no real, actual detail on the Government's plans. We want to avoid the debacle of the Limerick city of culture when funding was given very late in the day. The arts budget announced yesterday appears to be a stand-still budget except for a figure of €4 million which is set aside for commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">When we invite the Minister to attend for a progressive discussion on commemoration, we need details. With just 18 months to go, the days of talking flamboyantly about what "commemoration" means are over.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> I acknowledge the Government's decision yesterday to prioritise social housing and the homelessness crisis. I commend the Government, including the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, in this regard. As some Senators know, I recently made a public and private commitment to the tireless work of Fr. Peter McVerry and his trust. Eradicating the homelessness crisis by 2016 presents a major challenge. Ensuring the basic human right to shelter must be key for us all, never mind reclaiming a sense of dignity. Like Senator Hayden, I wish there was a mechanism for controlling spiralling rents, but the investment of €2.2 billion in social housing during the coming three years has provided the financial and political commitment that has been absent from social housing provision for many years. This is welcome.</p>

A couple earning €30,000 per year gains €174. This means that Government Senators and the Taoiseach will benefit four times more than the couple. Again, the Government has gone for an unfair and regressive budget. It had the opportunity to scrap water charges and the property tax and to put €800 million back into the pockets of working families across the State, which in turn would have boosted the economy. Instead, it gave the greatest relief to the highest paid earners.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">Proportionally, they will benefit more. While the Labour Party might disagree, these are the figures. A low-paid worker on €30,000 will gain €174, which will be negated by water charges. A middle-income earner on €50,000 will gain €546, most of which will be wiped out by the property tax and water charges. A higher earner on €70,000 will gain €746. The greatest benefit should have gone to middle and low-income workers as well as the unemployed. The Government's budget failed to address inequality and poverty. Instead, the budget will increase poverty and inequality levels. Cleverly from the Government's perspective, it tried to give something to everyone. In doing so, it gave nothing substantial to anyone except the top earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I wish to propose the amendment to the Order of Business that I proposed and withdrew yesterday because it was budget day, namely, that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should attend the House to discuss the water services plan.

          <p eId="para_124"> The budget is prudent and responsible and is designed to help low and middle-income families, with an emphasis on returning people to work. I welcome the €1.1 billion to be spent on employment supports in 2015. Currently, 1.92 million people are at work, an increase of 80,000 since 2012. Some 48,000 jobs are projected to be added to that figure by the end of 2015. Returning more people to work is key to ensuring that scarce resources are freed up to help the more vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> A number of the budget's provisions have not received much publicity but are to be welcomed, for example, the €10 million allocated for new Garda vehicles, which are badly needed to tackle rural crime. I refer in particular to burglars coming to rural Ireland in high-powered vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I agree somewhat with Senator Norris, but €600 million has been allocated in the budget for overseas development aid. This level of funding will enable Ireland to play a pivotal role in addressing the world's many humanitarian crises. I wish that other countries, many of which are richer than ours, honoured the commitments they gave at various forums and conferences. Ireland is the one country that honours every commitment it makes in respect of overseas humanitarian aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> I welcome the additional €1 million for new projects and initiatives as regards the diaspora. I am rather surprised that Senator Daly, who is always concerned about the diaspora, did not welcome this provision, which increased funding to €12.5 million.</p>

A huge meeting, it was attended by the relatives of the 1916 patriots. They expressed disappointment at the lack of progress and information on the commemoration. It would be helpful if we did not have to wait for much longer to see precisely what the programme will be. I acknowledge that the Minister has invited the relatives to meet her. Indeed, she has indicated that the draft programme may be published in the coming days. However, it is not helpful to have a debate developing that could become politically divisive.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">That is what happens in every other country. We would not be an exception. We are not just referring to the militaristic aspect of the Rising. It is clear from the Proclamation that the 1916 leaders were far-seeing people. Even the budgetary provisions that we are discussing can, in many ways, reflect the Proclamation, which referred to cherishing all the children of the nation equally. We should not minimise that time in our history simply because we also want to commemorate other aspects of history. The relatives' fear is that the 1916 commemoration will be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I have raised a question on the Order of Business three times regarding the volunteer, Thomas Kent, whose remains are lying in Cork jail. Everyone would agree that it is not a fitting place for the remains of such a brave man. Progress is being made, but I would like to see the same steps taken as were taken in respect of the forgotten ten volunteers, including Kevin Barry, buried in Mountjoy jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I still remember the outpouring of pride and affection at that time as tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin when the cortège was passing through the city. I think the Minister will be committed to what we are trying to achieve here and that we do not waste any more time on this. Otherwise we will have a negative and divisive debate, which is the last thing we want if we are commemorating the 1916 Rising.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Senator Norris charged the Minister in the Chamber yesterday of committing the grave error of splitting an infinitive and suggested that he required literacy lessons. I think some history lessons are need here because Senator Norris said all parties acquiesced in the destruction of this economy. History will show that along with Senator Norris, the Labour Party was the only party to oppose the bank guarantee on the night in question, which was one of the main contributors to the destruction of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The Fianna Fáil spokesperson said this budget represented a following of the late Brian Lenihan's four-year plan. If that is the case, it would be interesting to hear why Fianna Fáil has so vigorously opposed every measure the Government has been trying to implement over recent years, which culminated in a rather modest but significant and progressive budget yesterday. Fianna Fáil shouted and squealed when there were cutbacks, because it lamented them. It shouted and squealed when we maintained services, because it did not like the maintenance of services, and when we increased services in some areas, because that did not suit it either. Fianna Fáil is making a blatant and obvious political point out of this. The contribution of its spokesperson in the other House yesterday was greeted with derision. My colleague, Senator Coghlan, used the word "clownish" in regard to some of the contributions from Fianna Fáil Members in this House and I agree with him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> If this budget was an auction budget, how come its effect will increase GDP by 0.3%, which is certainly in the common good? Senator Daly lamented the fact that we are not spending enough-----</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I wonder if there is any truth in the rumour that the Irish <i>Daily Mail </i>will soon be distributing a free DVD of "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" to all readers. I regret very much that there was no late equaliser in yesterday's budget for single income families which still have to put up with the glaring injustice of having to pay up to €6,000 more in tax than double income couples in the same income bracket. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, failed on radio this morning to give any just rationale for the continuation of the tax individualisation policy, which was criticised by them in the past and by the Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, who contributed to an Iona Institute paper on the subject. It is very regrettable that we have seen no change to that policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I raise the issue of our preparedness to deal with any possible Ebola outbreak. The Minister for Health and the chief medical officer will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children tomorrow. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health to come to this House to debate this specific issue next week and not deal with any other issue? I am concerned there may be serious deficiencies in HSE guidance and protocols supplied to hospital staff to deal with patients with possible Ebola symptoms. I find it very hard to understand how one of the Government's first responses to questions was to warn the health unions not to exploit the issue and to make points about resources and industrial relations issues. It is the Government's responsibility to reassure the public that all necessary steps are being taken and that all staff are fully trained and equipped. Its failure to communicate beyond making general claims of readiness is irresponsible and worrying because it suggests it may not know the full picture in the hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I have been in touch with hospital-based professionals who have told me that no training has been provided to accident and emergency or front-line staff in one large Dublin hospital and that no dry runs have been implemented to date. I have been informed that information given to staff so far relates to the assessment and diagnostic process as well as protocols for the ambulance service, but there has been no information as to how to apply and remove personal protective equipment, for example, or supervision or observation of the removal of such equipment. Is all that true? Does it matter? Does the Minister know about that?</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> It has been reported to me that a patient with suspicious symptoms presented to a Dublin hospital at the weekend and although Ebola was eventually ruled out, it was not before considerable confusion and debate about protocols and a plan of action as the staff treated the patient. There was an original idea to bring the patient to the acute medical assessment unit but an on-the-hoof decision was made to move the person to an isolation room in the intensive care unit. The key point is that the support staff involved had no training on or education about their role and protection despite the fact they would need to be involved in non-clinical elements of the patient care process.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The Minister for Health should come to the House to tell us why screening at airports is right for Britain but wrong for Ireland. He should tell us if there have been drills and dry runs in each hospital and what personal protective equipment is being made available to staff and hospitals and whether it is of equal standard in all cases. I have a list of other concerns and questions which responsible professionals have raised and I would appreciate if the Government would give us an account of its stewardship. This House is the place to do that. I look forward to hearing what the Minister and the chief medical officer have to say to the Joint Committee on Health and Children tomorrow, but in any event the Minister should come to the House next week on this pressing issue of public concern. I will push the matter to a vote if necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">Yesterday's budget was a modest and prudent one. The objective was not only to sustain our economic recovery but also to reduce the deficit. We are acutely aware of the sacrifices the people have made over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">This budget is the first step in ensuring the benefits trickle down throughout the country. I am particularly delighted with the tax reliefs for the farming sector, which is our largest indigenous sector. The tax reliefs for older farmers who wish to transfer land to younger farmers should be greatly welcomed. That is important to ensure a sustainable agricultural industry. Incentives will also be introduced for young farmers to lease farms and to ensure older farmers can plan for the future. This is a positive step for our economy and for rural Ireland in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The retention of the 9% VAT rate in the food and hospitality sector is important. I referred previously to the effects of that. More than 23,000 have gained employment in the sector since the introduction of the reduced VAT rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> I also welcome the investment of €10 million secured by the Minister for Justice and Equality for the Garda fleet, and €3 million will also be provided for three new Garda divisional headquarters in Galway, Dublin and Wexford. The 100 recruits who entered the Garda college last September were the first to be recruited since 2009 when the previous Government put a stop to recruitment. All these measures are to be welcomed. They are modest but we are going in the right direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Go raibh míle maith agat. It is a great victory for everyone involved and there was great cross-party support in the House for it. I am delighted because it is a victory for older women who are entitled to treatment and services at any other age. As I have said in the House on numerous occasions, women aged between 55 and 75 are at a heightened risk of developing breast cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I congratulate Mr. John McCormack of the Irish Cancer Society on his passion for this resolution to be brought to us today. I will put the pressure on, as I am sure will my colleagues on the Government side, to have the programme rolled out for women aged over 69. It is a great victory for those of us who are opposed to ageism, which is endemic in our society. We all should look into our own hearts and address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I support the comments of my colleague, Senator Mark Daly. Under the Government, prescription charges have been increased five times. As people get older, they need more medical interventions and treatment. This will affect everyone in this Chamber. The older one gets, the more ailments one will have, inevitably. To have a good quality of life, it is good to have the right medication and treatments. It is disappointing that this has not been achieved. I do not want to spoil the Minister for Health's announcement, however, which is a great achievement about which I am delighted.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">I congratulate Senator White and all those involved. It is a great development and well done to her on her efforts. The One Young World Summit will be launched in Dublin later. It is a conference comprising more than 1,500 young people from around the world with representatives from 190 countries. World leaders such as Kofi Annan will address delegates. The conference is worth approximately €2 million to the local economy. Dublin has such conferences regularly because it is seen as a global leader in conference hosting. The Dublin Convention Bureau deserves credit for its work in this regard. We need to work more consciously on this and to promote other areas in the west, south and the midlands as venues for conferences. We can compete with the best in the world when it comes to conferences, and the launch of the One Young World Summit tonight will prove that. I seek a debate on tourism and conference hosting. It is linked, similar to the job creation debate we had a year ago, to exploring what measures we could undertake to bolster our increasing tourism numbers throughout the country and to attract more conferences.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">We are reflecting on the budget, which was politically clever. It ticked all the boxes in respect of a pre-election budget. It contained some good measures but overall it was a missed opportunity. All the Government Members are commending small interest groups that have benefitted from the budget, whether they are families or schools or specific projects, but overall we still have a significant budgetary deficit. The additional money Government Members are talking about is borrowed money which will still have to be paid for by the taxpayer in future years. The Government has a deficit, not a surplus.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The budget was a missed opportunity. The Government spoke about political reform and reforming our State institutions and this was the budget in which to do that. We often hear the phrase, "Never waste a good recession". This recession has been wasted by the Government because all that has happened is all the expenditure lines have remained the same with some tinkering around the edges. There was no radical reform of banking, including levying financial institutions. It will be proven in time that all this budget was about was 2016 and the next election and not about transforming our country or setting a 20-year target for where we want to be. That equates to a missed opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I support the call for a debate on Irish Water. That is the elephant in the room.</p>

Who will control the company then? It is not even included in the Estimates as providing an income to the State. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to come to the House to clarify the position regarding Irish Water and the pricing model.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I would like to highlight one tax change. One of the messages that has been lost in the budget is that we are competing internationally for highly skilled people, especially in the health sector. We have great difficulty retaining people in this sector and, therefore, the tax changes in the budget are welcome. Many qualified medical professionals are emigrating to Canada, the US, New Zealand, Australia and the UK because while they earn less money, they pay much less tax in those jurisdictions. If we want them to return, we must ensure salaries and the tax structure are attractive to them. There are more than 250 vacant consultant posts in our hospitals, which equates to more than 10% of posts. We must examine this in the long term because these people are needed to provide the health care system the population needs. Expertise is required and, therefore, we need these people to return. The budget is the first step to encourage them to return. I welcome the Minster for Finance's decision to introduce these changes to the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This is just the first of many steps that will have to be taken to make it more attractive for people such as these to come back and work in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I smiled when I heard the Minister, Deputy Noonan, quoting Robert Frost about the road less travelled. The budget is on a very old familiar highway, or should I say autobahn, of election budgets. This is what has framed it. Another big black hole in the budget is the health Estimate. Minuscule percentages have been built into the health budget over the next three years, which we all know cannot be realised. History shows that supplementary budgets must be introduced for the health Estimate and this will be the same. We are playing with borrowed money in difficult times. Obviously it is an election budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I support what Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú stated on the 1916 celebrations. The 1916 Rising was organised by the IRB, which was a highly secretive organisation, although not nearly as secretive as the Government in its plans to deal with the commemoration. I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that she will come clean on it. We must all be part of it. This must be a national celebration. We have paid due homage to those who died in the Great War and John Redmond, and rightly so as I have stated previously. The seismic date in Irish history is 1916, whether we like it or not, and it has informed all modern democratic politics in Ireland since. The men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice need to be focused on singularly in order that we can have a proper, respectful and meaningful commemoration of their deeds. I would like less emphasis on the militaristic side and more on the radical proclamation which they brought forward and which has been an example to us all.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Aontaím go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú agus ag an Seanadóir Ó Súilleabháin faoi chomóradh maith a dhéanamh ar 1916. Bheadh sé oiriúnach an tAire a bheith againn sa Teach le haghaidh díospóireachta ar an gcomóradh agus ar an bplean atá aici é sin a chur i bhfeidhm chomh luath agus is féidir.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> It is regrettable that descendants of the leaders of 1916 are speaking about organising their own commemoration simply because they have lost confidence in the process. This would be a real pity. There is an urgency to bring the Minister to the House in order that we have a good discussion in which she lays out her intentions regarding the programme. Even if it is not finalised, at least she could give us a sketch of what is in her mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I have always been a strong proponent of the men of 1916. They took on the might of the British army knowing they were probably going to sacrifice their own lives in the interests of attaining freedom. They were not pseudo-patriots who went out picking up mothers of ten to have them killed somewhere in the backwoods and left for decades before their bodies were recovered and who shamed the legacy of those people. This type of activity should not in any way inhibit us from ensuring a proper commemoration and I would like to see this happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I concur fully with what Senator Mullen stated on Ebola and I suggest to the Leader it would be a useful exercise if the Minister for Health came to the House and, rather than having a debate, we had a question and answer session on our preparedness for Ebola arising in this country. The Minister is as committed as everyone in the House to ensuring all the precautions and preparations are in place so that at least if we are unfortunate enough for it to happen, it will be handled effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">Senator Bacik made several comments, as did many other Senators, on the budget. Senator Bacik also welcomed the fact the Irish ambassador to Britain, a Waterford man like John O'Shea, who was also mentioned, will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph this year. She called for a debate on commemorations. The debate on commemorations, and 1916 in particular, was also mentioned by Senators Ó Murchú, O'Sullivan, Walsh and several others. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, gave a commitment last week that she would come to the House in early course, and we have it pencilled down for the middle of November. I hope the Minister will come to the House and we can have a comprehensive debate on 1916 and the decade of commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Senator Barrett spoke about the need for reform, and that reform must continue. He also spoke about the importance of fostering continued good relations between Ireland and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Senator Naughton welcomed the increased Garda numbers and the fact the Garda fleet will be increased by more than 400 vehicles, a matter raised by many Members of the House in recent months. I am very pleased we are now in a position to have more recruitment in the Garda and Army and that more than 400 vehicles will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Senator Hayden spoke about funding for homelessness and the €2.2 billion proposed for social housing, which is certainly badly needed. Social housing has been neglected for the past ten years and we see the situation now. I hope this massive injection of capital into social housing will ease the problems for so many on the housing lists at present. Senator Hayden also called for a debate on the private rental sector and the consultation process on the Central Bank proposals on mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Senator Norris spoke about overseas aid. As a percentage it has decreased, but the Government has allocated more than €600 million for overseas development aid. The level of funding will enable Ireland to continue to play a critical role in some of the most pressing humanitarian crises witnessed for many generations. The Government has also provided €14 million this year for victims of the appalling conflict in Syria and the region. We provide €10 million annually to support the Palestinian people and made a commitment at the international conference in Cairo for an additional €2.5 million for the reconstruction of Gaza. Through the Irish Aid programme and our funding for NGOs working in west Africa, we provide more than €16 million in assistance to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Much of this funding is focused on strengthening health systems and is also helping to fight Ebola. Our record is good. Obviously we would like it to be better, but Ireland contributes significantly to overseas aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">That is recognised by all the countries that are assisted through Irish efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Senator Mac Conghail also mentioned the commemoration of 1916. As I stated, I hope we will have that debate in the middle of November. He also welcomed the proposals for social housing and the significant amount of funding proposed for social housing. There is a €4 million package under the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht to roll out an integrated plan to commemorate 1916, as has been mentioned, and funding for current expenditure for the arts has increased for the first time in six years. Financial support for the national cultural institutions has been protected following many difficult years of cutbacks, which were mentioned in the arts debate in the House last week. The Minister for Finance has also committed to exploring measures to boost the film and television sector. An important point in relation to the arts, which has been mentioned here as well, is that the artist's tax exemption is being increased by €10,000, from €40,000 to €50,000, and this has been welcomed by the arts community.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Senator Cullinane raised the policies of the Government on taxation and other issues. He thanked me for the Government adopting some of the Sinn Féin policies last evening, but that has obviously changed here. Our policy to introduce an 8% rate of universal social charge for those earning more than €70,000 was welcomed by Sinn Féin in some quarters, but its members changed their minds overnight. These things happen from time to time. I am looking, in that wonderful booklet that was produced by Sinn Féin last week, at that party's proposal to increase employers' PRSI to 15.75%, which without question would be a tax on jobs. In the context of the Sinn Féin plan for Irish Water, Senator Cullinane asked for a debate. I stated yesterday that I would try to get the Minister in. I have asked the Minister and he has agreed that he will come in as soon as there is a date in his diary to come in, but he will not be able to come in today, as has been requested. The Sinn Féin plan for Irish Water would suggest that it would be no longer classified as an off-balance sheet effort and the €550 million hole is the equivalent of the entire property tax yield, which is a red letter issue for that party. Its proposals do not add up. That is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> On education, an issue Sinn Féin Members have raised in the House on several occasions, Sinn Féin forgot to allow for the increased funding to maintain the current pupil-teacher ratio. Sinn Féin's budget proposals would increase the pupil-teacher ratio from 28:1 to 30:1, which is a significant increase. Its members should tell the teachers to whom they have been promising everything over recent years what their proposals would mean.</p>

On the Ebola crisis, I mentioned yesterday that the Joint Committee on Health and Children will meet at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow. That is open to all Members of the House and we should try to avoid duplication at all times. The committee is open to Members to contribute to it. It is the appropriate forum because there is only one item on the agenda of the committee and it will be discussed from 9.30 to whatever time tomorrow. If there are other questions to be asked, we will try to facilitate it, but I do not like duplication in the House.</p>

As Senators will be aware, in this part of the Bill we focused in on vehicles that would be exempt from clamping. This amendment now includes vehicles that have safety cameras located within them.

          <p eId="para_258">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_259">In page 14, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_260">“(2) In prescribing the maximum charges the NTA shall take into account the costs of wrongly parked vehicles at parking places.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Go raibh míle maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I also welcome the Minister with whom I used to discuss many transport issues in days of yore in the economics department of Trinity College. It would be hard to believe then that out of 20 amendments the Minister would have tabled 11 to my nine amendments. I think people then would have said, "Let us send for the D'Unbelieveables". I noted the Minister's presentation at the meeting of the transport committee earlier. He said that when he presented this Bill on Second Stage he chose to come here even though his alternative engagement was a meeting of the European Council of Ministers of transport. His loyalty to this House and priorities are very welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Let me turn to my amendment. We had a very good discussion on clamping on Second Stage and there are contrasting views about it. On the one hand it is viewed as a menace, a nuisance, a threat to the future of transport as we know it and that it ruins people's weekends and so on. On the other hand, clamping is essential. If one allows completely uncontrolled parking cities will not be able to operate. That is why we are trying to steer a middle course here. </p>
          <p eId="para_263"> During the week somebody put it to me that clamping cures people because once it happens one makes sure to never again park in a place where one can be clamped. It has a deterrent value. In the discussions leading up to the presentation of this Bill I thought that clamping was pro-clamper but anti-driver. However, I did not recognise the cost to businesses and cities if people parked wherever they like and it is for this reason that we must steer the middle course.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Amendment No. 4 states that in prescribing the maximum charges the National Transport Authority, the body designated by the Minister in the Bill, shall take into account the costs of wrongly parked vehicles at parking places. We found that the main problem is public car parks with uncontrolled access. I have been told that off-street car parks, where people pay on the way out, do not become involved in clamping in the main. Therefore, we have to deal with what is already controlled on streets which are in the main operated by Dublin City Council. Many other cities appear to no longer use clamping. The Minister mentioned that the rest of the parking facilities concern people who have hotels, shopping centres, hospitals and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> People are annoyed at the level of charges. In the Bill there is a penalty of €100 and it will cost €50 for retrieval in cases where a vehicle is towed away. However, both penalties represent minuscule amounts compared with the damage caused to a business. Let us remember that the property is theirs. Let us also remember that it is their private property to which we as members of the public have access. It is intended that the parking outside hotels and shops will be availed of by people who want to do business in them. What if that space is blocked by people who have to be clamped? The real cost is not removing the clamp. The real cost is that business in those shopping centres becomes impossible to conduct if commuters going somewhere else avail of parking. </p>
          <p eId="para_266"> I ask that the National Transport Authority, in setting the cost to be imposed on wrongly parked vehicles, takes into account that the space is on private property and on land that is intended to promote the businesses which have paid for the property and that unlawful and wrongful parking in this regard should be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">This cost probably is far more than the fines of €100 and €50 envisaged in this provision, as clogging up an entire shopping area could do serious damage to the businesses whose property it is. That is the purpose of amendment No. 4, namely, that the cost of illegal parking does not pertain to operating the clamping but to the damage it does to the hotels, schools and hospitals. Some serious examples were provided when the Minister was here on the last day of people who block access of ambulances at hospitals. This would be a serious case that would merit a charge that was much greater than €50 or €100.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> The second amendment the Acting Chairman has asked me to take together with amendment No. 4 is amendment No. 10. This amendment proposes to insert on page 16, between lines 15 and 16, a proposal to take account of "complaints from property owners in respect of the costs to them of wrongfully parked vehicles". The provision concerned pertains to the complaints procedure and my comment in this regard is it reminds me of when I used to do a certain amount of such work within the university where, when complaints arose, the rule always was <i>audi alteram partem</i>, that is, hear the other side. If people who have been clamped have a right to complain to the National Transport Authority, NTA, in law, do those who lose out also have a right to be heard as otherwise, one will get a completely one-sided case? Of course people are cross, annoyed and so on but the Minister might consider this new section 17(6) on Report Stage, whereby this complaints procedure is open to both sides. As matters stand, the procedure is one-sided and perhaps the Minister might like to review this before the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The final amendment I have been asked to discuss is amendment No. 12. It proposes to amend section 21, which provides for the hearing of appeals. I have made the case that the procedures should take account of those who lose out because of the unlawful parking. Section 21 provides that the "NTA may prescribe procedures for hearing and determining appeals". It decides the form in which the appeal will be lodged, on the fees and on the making of submissions, whether oral or written, to the clamping appeals officer. It also prescribes procedures on requests for further information by the clamping appeals officer and examination by the clamping appeals officer of the appellant, that is, the person who feels aggrieved, and any other person. While "any other person" might include the person on whose property the parking infringement is alleged to have taken place, it seems strange to leave that discretionary and this is why I have included this provision. As I said earlier, it is on the principle of <i>audi alteram partem</i>. Perhaps these amendments might be considered before Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> In summary, do the charges reflect the cost? Is it the right of those who have paid for this land in their shopping centre or hotel to be heard? While an annoyed person will of course approach the clamping body and feel extremely cross and so on, there are two sides to the argument. Are the costs reflected adequately in the level of penalties? I should state that while the costs in Dublin City Council are €80 for declamping and €160 for tow-away, I believe that on top of that, it loses approximately a further €20. If the private sector is unable to recoup the cost of illegal parking on its land, will it lose out in equity in this regard? The goal is to try to get people to stay for two or three hours and then to leave. However, if they stay there all day on other people's property, are they covered? I note some of the charges envisaged in the Bill are less than those being imposed by Dublin City Council, which is losing money on it. Consequently, would all this add up as a proper deterrent for unlawfully or wrongfully parked vehicles?</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I thank the Senator for the amendments he has tabled. To give some context, as the Senator is aware, he has tabled nine amendments to this Bill in total. I believe three later amendments in particular contain proposals and thinking that will improve the Bill. I will revert to those particular three amendments on Report Stage, with the Senator's consent, to ascertain how they can be incorporated, albeit perhaps with new and different language, to better achieve the objectives the Senator seeks to deliver. One guiding point underpinning the Senator's amendments - and to which he referred a moment ago in his contribution - is the concept of trying to achieve a better degree of symmetry between the three parties that are involved in all of this. There is the person whose vehicle has been clamped, the person who or the organisation that is doing the clamping and then the third party, namely, the individual, business or community that is suffering a cost or incurring an opportunity cost due to a vehicle being illegally parked and being therefore the subject of clamping. My understanding of the amendments tabled by the Senator is that he seeks to achieve a greater degree of balance within the Bill to ensure that the views and needs of those three parties are recognised in a better way. As I indicated, I believe that within some of the other amendments the Senator has tabled and to which we will turn in a moment, there are provisions and ideas that, when incorporated into the Bill, will make it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> While I do not propose to accept the particular amendments under discussion, I wish to explain the reason to the Senator and to take him through my thinking in this regard. These amendments pertain to sections 14, 17 and 21 and seek to recognise parties who suffer due to an illegally-parked vehicle being in their facilities. The Senator seeks to amend the Bill to ensure that their needs are better recognised. However, my response regarding such needs is that if one considers the process established within this Bill, the NTA itself will have the ability to specify the level of clamping fee. It also will have the ability, if it chooses to use it, to establish a code of practice regarding any part of this industry. Moreover, for the fee to be advanced by the NTA, it must advertise in a newspaper, must place it on its website and it must be subject to a period of public consultation at the end of which the authority then will make its determination as to what will be that fee. My concern regarding the incorporation of these amendments into the Bill is there may be other issues or views that the other parts of the triangle to which I referred - the person who is clamped, the clamper and the business or community within which the clamping takes place - wish to advance within the consultation process. My concern regarding the Senator's proposals, which is why I will not accept them, is they would specify one matter in particular that might be raised with the NTA in advance of the authority putting in place a process for maximum charges. In the legislation as drafted at present, I do not wish to be prescriptive about stating which particular issue should be considered by the NTA during the consultation process. This is a matter I want it to consider, after which I want all other parties to have an opportunity to have an input therein. My view of the Senator's amendments is they raise issues that would be dealt with better within the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> With the powers I am giving the NTA it will be in a better place to handle the matters the Senator raises. </p>

          <p eId="para_276">I move amendment No. 5:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_277">In page 14, line 17, to delete “€100” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_278">“€120 per twenty four hours or part thereof and with a surcharge of €35 for release between 22.00 and 08.00”. </p>
          <p eId="para_279">These amendments deal with the penalties. The Minister has already said this will be a matter for the NTA. The penalties envisaged in section 14 are €100 for a clamp release charge and €50 for a relocation charge. I did a survey in the west of Dublin at the weekend. The figures in the amendment are the present charges. If the industry is in equilibrium they could be pegged back to €100 and €50. The Dublin City Council relocation charge is €160 if one’s vehicle is towed away. I presume relocation means that one has to find out where the car is and releasing it from there is regarded as more serious than being clamped on the street where the council charges €80.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The Bill contains a default position and it is open to the NTA to decide charges. Were the Bill to enforce the €100 and €50 charges it would damage the businesses which now feel it necessary to charge €120 for 24 hours or part thereof. Keeping clamp release vehicles on a 24-hour basis costs money so the operators have a surcharge. It costs much more than €50 to retrieve the car from where it has been relocated and that is why I put in €150 in amendment No. 6. My concern was that is what it costs to do this and any expectation people reading the Bill might have that it could be done for €100 or €50 is not right. The council is not doing it for that price. There are typically surcharges in places such as university campuses and shopping centres if one wants to be released at night. This could lead to a situation where the system would not be enforced at all at those low prices. Presumably those fines are necessary to ensure discipline in parking in the places concerned. It costs a great deal to get a clamper to come out after midnight. That is why I have tabled these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I do not agree with the surcharge Senator Barrett proposes. Being clamped can be traumatic for certain people. The Minister is right to ask the NTA to set a fixed rate for a clamping fee. A surcharge may be abused in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> On Second Stage I asked the Minister to draw up a charter of rights for people whose cars are clamped requiring that they be released within a certain time of the person contacting the clamper. I do not know whether that is part of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_283"> What is the duty on the clamping company to notify the owner if his or her car has been towed away? If a person’s car is missing, even if it was illegally parked, he or she would contact the gardaí first to report it as stolen. The Minister should make some provision for that. I asked that the gardaí be the only ones allowed to be present when a car is being towed away and that people are notified. Can they be texted? When people tax their cars they provide an e-mail address or mobile telephone number. Even if people are breaking the law or taking up spaces on private property there must be a duty to inform them if they are clamped.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">Senator Barrett’s description of the operation of this Bill is correct. His amendments refer to the clamp release and relocation charges in non-statutory areas. If he went on to say "in those areas where the NTA does not exercise its power to put in place a fee", a foundation of this Bill is that it would lead to the introduction of default charges. In the absence of the NTA putting in place a charging structure the Bill would provide that structure in non-statutory areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> We are not seeking to create a one-size-fits-all approach. I expect that the NTA would avail of the power this Bill grants it and use that power to put in place a charging regime that would reflect the fact that clamping is taking place in a non-statutory area and deal with issues such as timing and where the vehicle is clamped. However, the Senator’s amendments make two points that are worthy of further consideration. The first is whether €100 is adequate and the second is the notion of timing. I differ from Senator O’Neill in one regard because Senator Barrett has mentioned symmetry and the need to recognise the fact that there are certain kinds of things for which someone who is clamped incurs a higher cost. Similarly, there is a certain kind of clamping that costs more. Senator Barrett is asking how we can ensure that the higher cost for a person who is clamped is recognised but also if a clamper incurs a higher level of cost that should be recognised too. The amendment makes an important point. While I cannot accept the amendment as drafted I will consider these points for Report Stage and see if the amendments could be amended to reflect some of Senator Barrett’s thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> In response to Senator O’Neill’s point about a charter of rights, I propose and expect that the power I am granting the NTA as a result of the Bill would mean it would then have the power to address the kind of issues to which he has referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Those issues could include the rights of the person who has been clamped or having a consistent procedure in place regarding the movement of vehicles which would provide clarity for everyone on what should or should not be done. There are many matters that could be addressed by the NTA but if I were include this proposal in the Bill, I would do two things. First, I would end up undermining the ability I want to give the NTA to act in terms of its powers. Second, I, as Minister, would be unnecessarily prescriptive in saying these are the issues that should be considered. If we are giving the NTA these powers, we should allow it the space to say these are the issues that should be examined, allow members of the public to have a say and then let the NTA make a decision on it. I genuinely believe that is the best way the issues to which the Senator referred, which are consumer-oriented and relate to people's rights in such a situation, can be dealt with by the NTA in terms of the powers conferred on it by the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I certainly believe it would be in order for the Senator to give her view, once the body is set up, on the power that it would be able to use. I would go further and say that given that this Bill very much reflects the input of the Oireachtas transport committee, it would be a good morning's work, on enactment of the Bill which will give the NTA such powers, to invite the representatives of the authority to appear before that committee to have a discussion on these issues and to ask them if they are matters they would contemplate considering. I expect they would be but given the role the committee has played on this Bill to date, it is appropriate that its members would continue to be actively engaged in this respect and give their views to the NTA regarding the work they think it should be considering.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">I accept the points the Minister has made. There is no dispute in regard to the statutory areas and parking in that they are defined in terms of double yellow or single yellow lines or areas where motorists can park. The issue arises in non-statutory areas such as hotel car parks and parking outside schools where somebody makes a decision that a motorist is illegally parked. A silly example of that would be if I were to go into a hotel or a supermarket and buy a cup of coffee at 8 a. m. but leave my car parked on the premises for 24 hours. Would that purchase entitle me to park outside the premises for 24 hours? Who would make a decision that a person has parked outside a premises for more than three hours and that the car should be clamped?</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I agree with the Senator's first point. Greater clarity needs to be brought to the practice that is allowed in the non-statutory areas and how it should work. Speaking as someone who has been clamped on two occasions, as I said on Second Stage, a particular area that should be examined is the appeals process in respect of the non-statutory areas. The Senator gave the example of a person who purchases a cup of coffee or another item in a premises and leaves their vehicle parked outside it for the full day. I would hope that the NTA would have a code on practice that would cover that and other such matters. That is the reason I do not want to include such matters in legislation. If I was to prescribe particular matters that the NTA should do, such as the consideration of the issue the Senator mentioned, that would undermine the autonomy it currently has, and it does a very good job. It would also prescribe and limit the number of areas it could examine through the powers it will have to issue a code of practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill. I believe it will eradicate the cowboy operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I have not been clamped, but many of our third level institutions and universities hold open days. NUI Galway holds two open days and UCD and other institutions throughout the country also hold open days at various times during the year. If I was to park in the campus of DkIT in Dundalk I would be clamped, although there is no signage indicating that clamping is in operation. Two constituents of mine, a mother and her daughter, recently attended an open day in NUI Galway. The mother drove 160 miles to the university and had not been there previously. Her daughter was anxious to do a course of study at the university. They had a great day and came back to discover that their car was clamped. This was a traumatic experience for the mother and her daughter started to cry. I discussed the matter with the mother for quite a while. She told me she had traversed the car park for 20 minutes and when she could not find a place to park, she decided to park in an area that was available where there were no yellow lines and where her car was not obstructing traffic. When she returned to her car and found it clamped, she noticed there were at least two or three other cars clamped. That was her first time to go to NUI Galway; she did not know the parking arrangements that were in place there. She paid the fine of €60 or €80 and was declamped. I suggest consideration should be given to accommodating parking for people attending open days at our third level institutions. I am not saying people should be able to park for free but a designated parking area should be provided for visitors to the campuses on those days. Those who attend those days traverse the country. In this instance, those people travelled to NUI Galway and the mother and her daughter, a potential student at the college, left the college with a sour taste in their mouths. I do not know if the NTA has the authority to do this or if we can ask the campuses to provide an area for parking on open days, which only number two days in many of the colleges.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I will respond to the Senator's point. A university campus would be a non-statutory area. It is part of the amendment we are discussing and therefore it is a relevant point. It sounds as if it was a counterproductive day for those people who went along to the university to check it out and then had that experience. The reason I cannot prescribe such a provision in the Bill is that if I was to prescribe the location the Senator proposed and not prescribe other locations, it would raise a question regarding the status of the non-prescribed locations. If I was to start prescribing locations, I would end up limiting the power of the NTA in terms of a code of practice that it may issue in the future. As I said to Senator O'Neill, I genuinely believe that the matter Senator Brennan raised is better dealt with through the power that the NTA would have.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The Senator made a point on what was a common theme in some of the contributions on Second Stage, namely, where the signage should be located and the messages on it. Those are the issues I hope the National Transport Authority, NTA, will be able to address with the powers given to it in this Bill and measures such as a code of practice for the industry. I accept the importance of the Senator's point, which feeds back to the way we regulate non-statutory areas, but the best way to deal with that is through the powers provided to the NTA in the Bill.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_301">In page 15, line 20, after “practicable” to insert “within two hours”.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">This issue was raised by several Senators. When the money is paid, when can someone expect to have their car released? In one shopping centre it was clarified that, on average, it takes two hours for that to happen because the clampers might serve a number of areas. Not knowing when their car will be released seems to make people even more annoyed, and as other Senators said, it is a traumatic experience. In some cases the clampers say they hope they will be back in two hours. Would it help the person who is annoyed to know their car might be released in two hours? Anything else might be unreasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Can those in the clamping business get back to everybody quickly? I appreciate what Senator Brennan said but on another campus the fine is €80 for 24 hours or more, with a €30 release fee after 7 p.m. That happens on campuses. Presumably the fear is that they would be used as free car parks, which is unfortunate. On this particular issue, does the two-hour waiting period help? Under a code of conduct the person being clamped will have to be informed when it is reasonable to expect the clamp to be released after they have paid. We would all like that to happen immediately, but I came across a case where the waiting time was two hours. If they could do better they would, but that was the normal waiting time.</p>

In that way people will not have to wait for hours for their car to be released. If the clampers do not return within the required time, there should be a reduction in the fee or the fee should be waived. That could be inserted in what Senator O'Neill referred to as the charter of rights. The NTA might examine the issue and, as the Minister suggested, the Oireachtas committee should examine it also.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Senator Barrett has made a good point, and I will come back on Report Stage with an amendment to reflect it. Section 16(1) of the Bill refers to the release period. It states, "as soon as reasonably practicable", but there is a provision in subsection (2) regarding the release time for a vehicle that has been relocated. Senator Barrett has identified an omission in the Bill. In describing the role of the NTA earlier, I stated that it will have the power to propose charges and examine issues such as release fees and, in the absence of that, a default level would be applicable. What Senator Barrett is proposing is that a similar default time would kick in in the way a default cost would apply if the NTA did not use that power. It is a good point. There is a need for us to be consistent in that if we are saying there should be a default setting for cost, there should also be a default setting for release time of a clamped vehicle, particularly as I recognise that point elsewhere in the Bill in reference to vehicles that have been relocated. I will come back on Report Stage with an amendment phrased in a way that reflects the input of the Parliamentary Counsel. It will be applicable to subsections (1) and (2) of section 16 on which the Senator is focusing. I thank him for bringing this issue to my attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">This amendment deals with the statement by the owner of the vehicle that the use was not authorised by him or her. The Bill states that when the owner succeeds in that claim, the controller or operator shall waive the relevant charge and he or she shall remove or cause the removal of the clamp from the vehicle. The wording was a little loose because if one's vehicle has been stolen, why would one not notify the Garda rather than saying it was stolen while parked outside a hotel, especially if there is no evidence of a break in? Is that a loophole? The person may not know the vehicle has been stolen but if he or she is using that as a defence, An Garda Síochána should be invoked. That is the reason I tabled the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">This is a very interesting amendment which was considered carefully by me and my officials because it goes to the heart of an important point regarding road safety legislation. The Senator is focusing on section 16(4) which states that if a vehicle is stolen, the person who owns the vehicle is not subject to the clamping fee if he or she can state that the vehicle was stolen. As currently drafted, this section does not require the person to notify the Garda that the vehicle has been stolen because this is consistent with the way we handle an issue such as this one across the body of our road safety legislation. Having consulted with the Attorney General, I am advised that if we were to raise the onus of proof regarding this issue in the Bill, it would raise questions as to how we handle this issue in other road safety legislation. I cannot accept the Senator's amendment, although I understand the reasoning behind it, because of the consequences of this change in this Bill for the remaining body of road safety legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">It would raise questions regarding why that threshold was not adjusted elsewhere. It is for that reason that I cannot accept the amendment the Senator has proposed. As I have said, it points to an important theme in our road safety legislation. Those of us who have had our cars clamped know that it is a difficult experience for an individual to go through. If a person's car is stolen, and the stolen car is then clamped, it is a double misfortune for him or her. This Bill recognises that by making provision in cases in which people can prove the car was stolen. Proof of notification of the Garda, which most people would be required to do anyway, will be adequate under this Bill. I am not requiring such notification to take place because I want to be consistent about how we handle issues like this across all our road safety legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I thank the Minister. He raised a most interesting point. When his predecessor was in this House to deal with road safety legislation, which of course has the support of everybody on all sides of the House, we considered issues like whether people should be required to have their driving licences with them now that we have moved to a credit card system. How does that make road safety difficult to enforce? I am concerned that people will use the provision that is being made for cases in which vehicles are stolen as a loophole. I have referred to the non-endorsement by the Courts Service of penalty points in cases in which people had been advised off the record not to bring their licences to the courts. I could also mention the current situation regarding penalty points and whistleblowers. We need to look at some of the things that have damaged attempts to promote road safety in this country. I do not suggest that should be done in the context of this small amendment this morning. It is a much wider task for the Office of the Attorney General. When it was suggested in one of the presentations that 40% of penalty points involve people with no licence, we said that could not possibly be the case. When the Minister's predecessor investigated the matter, it was found that this cohort of people was split equally between those who did not bring their licences to court and those about whom the whistleblowers have been talking. If we cannot get a tighter control on stolen vehicles, there will be safety implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> When the Minister is considering the issue of road safety, perhaps he can examine certain rights that seem strange in the context of an industry that used to kill approximately 650 people each year. That figure has been lowered to approximately 160. The Minister was telling us earlier that this year's rate is similar to last year's rate. The recent deterioration has stopped. It seems peculiar that people do not have to report stolen vehicles. Action in this area would assist the Garda in relation to other crimes as well. Stolen vehicles are often hidden away and then used in robberies four or five weeks later. We need to keep a grip on this activity. The Minister has raised a wider issue. This amendment simply relates to a defence that is used. I do not know what would happen if someone stole my car and illegally parked it in a hotel for two weeks while I was on holidays. Some corroboration should be required in such circumstances. I appreciate the Minister's point. I will not pursue this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_315"> I would like to respond briefly to the point he made about road safety legislation. Before I came to the Seanad this morning, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications at which the Senator was present. I place great value on what we need to do to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. At this morning's meeting, the Senator raised the serious and legitimate public concerns that exist regarding the issuing of penalty points. I repeat that this issue is being taken very seriously by the Government. I have received a report and a notification from a working group that was established to ensure the right lessons are learned from this episode. One of the measures I have provided for is the greater centralisation of individuals within the Garda Síochána who have the ability to cancel or change penalty points. This measures goes to the heart of addressing some of the concerns raised by the Senator. I thank him again for not pursuing this amendment and for showing an interest in how this Bill can be improved.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">This amendment relates to an area about which people feel cross. I refer to the question of whether a clamping appeals officer has the right to say that an appeal is vexatious and therefore award costs against the person who brought that appeal. The officer can make an order to refund costs to the person bringing the appeal, but how will we deal with frivolous or vexatious appeals? As I said the last day, the relevant amount is €100 - it is not the end of the world. Do we want vast numbers of lawyers to get involved in this area? I am asking whether the clamping appeals officer should have the discretion to award costs against a person who brings a frivolous or vexatious appeal rather than against the person who has to attend. Perhaps the cost to the State or the National Transport Authority of having a clamping appeals service should also be considered in this context.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I understand the sentiment that underpins Senator Barrett's amendment. All public representatives, and indeed the public, are often aware that frivolous appeals are being made. This is particularly true with regard to An Bord Pleanála. We have a rule in this country that the polluter pays, but that does not seem to apply when people make frivolous appeals to An Bord Pleanála about planning permissions in which they have no interest. It has often been said that these costs should be borne by those who make such appeals. I understand the idea behind Senator Barrett's amendment. I will listen with interest to the Minister's reply. I would also like Senator Barrett to set out who will determine what the costs will be if it is to be permissible for costs to be granted to the parking controller in cases of frivolous appeals. Who will make the decision on what payment should be made?</p>

I will revert on Report Stage with a perhaps differently worded amendment to achieve a similar objective. If we are saying that someone who is clamped has rights in terms of unfair costs imposed on them, then the argument also goes the other way. This amendment recognises that fact, in that, if a process takes place and the appeals officer finds in favour of the person who is clamping, costs may also have been incurred by that person. This matter should be considered and relates to a point I made when responding to Senator Barrett's earlier contribution. His amendments are seeking to introduce a better degree of symmetry to the Bill between the three forces to which I referred, those being, the clamper, the clampee and the individuals in the environment where the potentially illegal parking takes place. When we incorporate the thinking behind the Senator's proposal in the Bill, it will improve the Bill's operation. While I cannot accept the amendment now, I accept the Senator's argument. With his support, I propose to revert with a further amendment on Report Stage to take on board the point that he has successfully made.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">This refers to the hearing of appeals by the clamping appeals officer. The rationale is that, in circumstances where proceedings have been brought against an appellant for an alleged offence of unlawful parking in respect of which the vehicle concerned was clamped or relocated and where these proceedings have been heard but are dismissed or unsuccessful, any clamp release or vehicle relocation charge will be refunded. The use of the word "any" rather than "the" more accurately reflects the intent of this subsection.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The proposed new section is on the operation of fixed payment notices. As Senators will be aware, the Bill provides that the National Transport Authority, NTA, may bring proceedings and prosecute summarily for offences committed under the Act. However, the only option in the Bill as drafted is for offences to be brought straight to the court system.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> My proposed amendment will allow the NTA to operate a fixed payment notice system. As with the fixed charge processing system that operates under road traffic legislation, the NTA, where it believes an offence has been committed, will be able to serve a notice on an alleged offender for certain offences requesting the payment of €250 within 28 days. The offences involved are failing to comply with or contravening a provision of clamping regulations that is stated in the regulations to be a penal provision; failure by a parking controller to provide signage in accordance with section 10(1), other than in paragraph (c); and failing to comply with a requirement of a member of An Garda Síochána relating to the moving of a clamping vehicle that is endangering the safety of or impeding other road users. If the €250 is not paid within a 28 day period, the person has a further 28 days in which to pay an increased amount. If the payment is not made within 56 days, then court proceedings will commence.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The main benefit of this amendment will be a saving in court time and a reduction in inconvenience for the NTA officers and the alleged offenders. A person who receives a fixed payment notice will not be obliged to make the requested payment. As always under the State's laws, the person will be entitled to defend his or her position in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The rationale for the amendment is contained in the last few words I used. We all know how precious the court's time is and the costs incurred by individuals or, sometimes, the taxpayer in going to court. By introducing this new section, the amendment seeks to find a way of keeping clamping activity out of the court system and dealing with it more effectively and directly by the NTA while not undermining in any way the ability of an individual to go to court if he or she believes his or her rights have been infringed in any manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I am pleased to be in the Chamber to present the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014, the primary purpose of which is to amend the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008. The Act gives effect to 12 international agreements that establish the existing legislative framework for the provision of mutual legal assistance. The Bill is necessary in order to give effect to a further six international instruments not yet provided for in the Act, but which have been ratified by the Oireachtas and must be implemented before December.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> At the outset, I should set out what mutual legal assistance means in practice. In simple terms, it enables a state to provide, within its own jurisdiction, a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter. The type of assistance may concern such matters as the investigation of serious international crime, including the gathering of evidence for use abroad, or the service of documents issued by a judicial authority. It may also involve the freezing or confiscation of proceeds of crime that have been trafficked across borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The first of the six agreements to which the Bill is giving effect is the 2005 Council framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties. This instrument establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a financial penalty order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. This agreement will, for example, allow fines imposed by courts in one member state to be collected in another member state where the person concerned resides or is a citizen. The agreement applies to fines imposed that exceed €70 in respect of any criminal matter, including road traffic offences. It would apply to any fine imposed that is appealable to a criminal court. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 26 November 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The second agreement is the 2006 Council framework decision on the mutual recognition of confiscation orders. This instrument establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. These confiscation orders are used primarily to recover proceeds of crime that have been trafficked from one state to another. They can be used to recover stolen objects or to seize financial criminal assets. Ireland receives approximately five or six such requests each year. The Houses approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 2 June 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> The third agreement in respect of which I am asking the House to agree this Bill is the 2008 Council decision on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations. This instrument aims to improve co-operation between the special intervention units of member states in man-made crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat, such as terrorist incidents. It should be noted that the framework decision would only become relevant in the event of a serious terrorist or similar incident. The situation envisaged would involve a large-scale crisis where a single member state may not have the means, resources or expertise to deal with it. Assistance could take the form of the provision of equipment, expertise or direct assistance on the territory of the requesting member state.</p>

In addition, they would only be able to operate within the limits of their own national powers. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council decision on 4 June 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 strengthens Eurojust, which is an EU agency based in The Hague that deals with judicial co-operation in criminal matters. This Council decision amends the earlier Council Decision 2002/187/JHA which established Eurojust, and provides for increased co-operation of Eurojust with other agencies such as the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, and Europol, and strengthens its operational capabilities. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council decision on 26 November 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Council framework decision of 26 February 2009 enhances the procedural rights of persons and fosters the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial. This instrument seeks to ensure that principles of natural justice are adhered to in cases where judgments <i>in absentia</i> arise in regard to requests for mutual legal assistance. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council framework decision on 10 December 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> An agreement between the European Union and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters was the subject of a Council decision in 2010 . This agreement provides for mutual legal assistance between EU member states and Japan, based on the laws of the requested state. Implementation by Ireland will be based on existing provisions of the 2008 Act. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council decision on 25 November 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> These international agreements have all been ratified or adopted by Ireland following their approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas. For ease of reference, the text of each of these international agreements will be added to the Schedules to the 2008 Act by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> In addition to making the necessary legal provision for these international agreements, the Bill also makes a number of minor corrections to existing legislation. The legislation being amended includes the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1998, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004, the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I will answer any questions Senators may have, but will now go through some of the sections in more detail. Sections 7 to 23 amend the 2008 Act to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA. These are the most technical parts of the Bill and I will elaborate a little on the need for these sections and the effect they will have on the legislation. This instrument establishes new rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. Under the existing provisions of the 2008 Act, all external confiscation orders must be translated by an Irish court into a domestic confiscation co-operation order. However, under the provisions of this framework decision, courts will in future recognise confiscation orders from member states without the necessity to issue a domestic confiscation co-operation order. This means that effectively we will be required to operate two different regimes for dealing with confiscation orders received from other states. Those received from EU states will not require a domestic confiscation co-operation order but those received from non-EU states will continue to require a domestic co-operation order issued by an Irish court.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Section 7 amends section 38 of the 2008 Act to provide that the powers of recovery of property by the High Court or by a receiver will apply to confiscation orders transmitted by member states, as well as to confiscation co-operation orders issued by the court in respect of requests from non-member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Section 8 amends section 44 of the 2008 Act to provide that freezing of the relevant property remains in place until such time as the property confiscation process has been concluded or terminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Section 9 amends section 45(1) of the 2008 Act to provide that the central authority may apply to the High Court to have a freezing co-operation order varied or discharged. This corrects an oversight in the 2008 Act. At present, only a person affected by the order can apply to have it varied or discharged. However, the Department has found that where a freezing co-operation order is flawed, for whatever reason, the person affected often does not have reason or need to seek a variation or discharge. This amendment will allow the central authority to seek a variation or discharge in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Section 14 creates a new section 51B in the 2008 Act. This new section provides for enhanced provisions for refusal of confiscation orders. Senators may wish to note that for reasons of legal consistency, I am providing that the grounds for refusal or postponement of confiscation will be exactly the same, whether a confiscation request is from an EU or non-EU state. The grounds for refusal reflect the provisions of Article 8 of Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA. Among the grounds for refusal are where the offence is not an offence to which the international instrument relates and that a person cannot be tried a second time for an act on which another court has already adjudicated. Subsection (1)(d) provides for refusal if the judgment was made <i>in absentia</i> and the defendant did not have an opportunity to defend the case. This particular provision is required to give effect to the 2009 Council framework decision on decisions rendered <i>in absentia</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Section 15 creates a new section 51C in the 2008 Act, to provide for postponement of confiscation. The grounds for postponement include where it might prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation in the State or where confiscation proceedings in respect of the property are already in train.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Sections 22 and 23 amend the 2008 Act to provide that relevant sections of the Act apply to external confiscation requests from EU member states as they apply to requests from non-member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The next element of the Bill is a new element in mutual assistance legislation to give effect to Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on mutual recognition of financial penalties. When this part of the Bill is enacted and commenced, the effect will be that fines greater than €70 which are imposed in this State can be collected by another member state if the person concerned is a resident or citizen of that other EU state. Furthermore, penalties imposed in other EU states on persons who are residents or citizens of this State will be collected in this State. The provisions of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 will apply to such fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Section 24 inserts a new part into the 2008 Act to provide for this mutual recognition of financial penalties. Sections 60A, 60B, 60C, 60D, 60E, 60F and 60G, which will be in the new part, set out the definitions and procedures in this regard and give detail on how mutual recognition of fines will be carried out in member states. Section 60I provides that amounts collected on foot of executing a financial penalty order accrue to the Exchequer unless otherwise agreed with the issuing state.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Minor technical amendments will be made to the wording of the 2008 Act. Sections 28 and 29 make an explicit provision that where evidence sought by another state is already in the possession of the Garda Síochána or the evidence is obtained on foot of a warrant, the Garda may transmit the evidence to the requesting state. This is simply to provide legal clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Section 30 provides that where requests for searches for evidence under section 74 or 75 are conducted by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to revenue offences, the officers of the Revenue Commissioners have the same powers of search and seizure of evidence as have An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Sections 31 and 35 give effect to the 2008 Council Decision on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations as I have already described. The section inserts a new Chapter 8A in the 2008 Act setting out the procedures which will apply in regard to requests and operation of special intervention units. I have already said the type of situations that it is expected that this would apply. I can say that an incident of this type has not happened to date in Ireland or in any other EU member state. In the event that such a major international incident did occur here we would be able to request appropriate assistance from other member states. Senators will note that the express agreement of the Government will be required if, as a result of the commission of a criminal offence, a crisis situation did exist and it is in the public interest to seek the assistance of a special intervention unit from another state.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Sections 94A to 94E, inclusive, go into details of what would happen if a crisis situation applied. They explain how it would be defined and how the Garda Commissioner would, for example, establish a special intervention unit if we wanted to supply aid to another member state. The following sections deal with repealing the sections in different pieces of legislation which is necessary in order for these framework decisions to be fully implemented and passed here today. </p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to present this legislation today. I hope it will receive much support in this House. It will assist in enhancing mutual legal assistance and mutual assistance provision. It will provide for wider and more efficient co-operation in fighting transnational crime which, as we know, is a huge issue. Whether we are talking about drugs, trafficking of human beings or financial criminal activity we need this kind of international co-operation and sharing of information, and co-operation between police forces and between governments. The increased mutual assistance powers provided here will be of use both in detecting and prosecuting criminals. It is essential legislation in a world where crime is international and does not respect any borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</p>

          <from>Senator Averil Power<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_382">I welcome the Minister to the House. She is right on the necessity for this legislation because crime is so international. Nowadays it is easy to launder money internationally due to complex payment systems and because we have become more borderless as a Continent. The latter is a good thing for people who want to move around Europe and internationally without experiencing visa restrictions, border controls and such like. However, criminals find it easier to exploit such openness which means there is an increasing need for the type of co-operation outlined, particularly across the EU. Unfortunately, Ireland has been a little bit slow in terms of opting into justice measures at EU level. I hope the Minister will be more proactive in this regard. We cannot tackle organised crime on a national level because it can only be effectively done at a European level and through much greater global co-operation as well. It can only truly be tackled if the Garda and our other agencies, such as the courts, have enough resources to implement this legislation and thus provide the best possible detection of crime and co-operation with organisations at a European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Recently we had a very good example of excellent cross-border co-operation. I refer to the seizure of a yacht in Irish waters beside Cork that was carrying €80 million worth of cocaine. From an Irish point of view it was an excellent operation. The Naval Service boarded the boat and reeled it in and the Air Corps provided air cover. It was a big international operation as it was based on intelligence from English and French services. It was also the result of European co-operation because it utilised the EU Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre in Lisbon. It was great to see different countries co-operating and working to ensure that any piece of information and intelligence anywhere about cross-border crime is shared. It was also great that we pooled our resources and manpower to make sure that criminals cannot use Irish waters to access Europe. It was good to see we have the systems in place to catch them.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> For every ship that is caught I worry how many have made it through. Drugs are an incredibly lucrative business. Criminals probably factor into their calculations that a certain number of their shipments will be seized. They plan to still make money on the nine or ten shipments that get through and land their cargo. </p>
          <p eId="para_385"> I am concerned about the limited resources that the Irish Naval Service has to police Irish waters, particularly as Ireland is a strategic entry point into the European Union. I ask the Minister to do everything that she can to increase its resources. It is essential when talking about the fight against drugs that we say it is a fight against international drug barons and, therefore, must have procedures in place to tackle them.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> While I outlined a good example of international co-operation, the system is clearly lacking in terms of white collar crime. Earlier this year two former Anglo Irish executives were found guilty in the Irish courts for the part they played in transactions that ultimately led to collapsing the Anglo Irish Bank. We all know the disastrous effects that has had on the Irish economy. Mr. David Drumm has been described by the judge in that case as the author of the illegal loan scheme but he has never been questioned by the Garda because he fled to the US after the bank collapsed and put himself beyond reach. I understand that the information that led to the conviction of the other two individuals came about through their questioning; it was information that they gave up when they were being questioned by the Garda. Mr. Drumm was the CEO of the bank. Those individuals referred to him as being their boss and claimed they were just following his orders. He has never been questioned. While Irish people are paying the price for the collapse of the Anglo Irish Bank he is living it up in Boston. Whatever about hiding in a Brazilian jungle or living in a lawless country where one does not expect to be able to co-operate with the authorities and get somebody brought back, many people are flabbergasted that he is living it up in Boston and has been able to put himself beyond the reach of the Irish authorities in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> I know I must be careful about what I say. I do not want to make any remarks in this House that might jeopardise any future proceedings. I refer to the remark made by the judge that Mr. Drumm was the author of the scheme referred to. Those are not my words. They are the words of a High Court judge who said that Mr. Drumm was the author of the illegal loans scheme. At the very least, Mr. Drumm needs to be questioned about the matter. He should have volunteered for questioning because it is the decent thing to do. If he feels he has a case to put forward to prove his innocence then he should have volunteered for questioning. That has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> This week there have been reports published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that perhaps the DPP is getting closer to finally getting Mr. Drumm extradited from the US. It beggars belief that five years have elapsed and we still have not been able to get him extradited to this jurisdiction or even have him returned to answer questions. This situation shows there is something desperately wrong with the procedures we have in place for co-operating with the US. That country is one of Ireland's main trading and diplomatic partners in the world yet we have not been able to have David Drumm returned to this country even for questioning. </p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I understand that there was talk around the time of the Anglo Irish Bank trial that the offence with which the two executives were found guilty of - the illegal loan scheme - is not illegal, in US legislation in that it is not illegal to sell loans to buy a share in one's own company, as is the case here. There are difficulties in making sure, if somebody is being brought back from another country, that the offence is an offence in both jurisdictions. We need to look at putting systems in place to ensure that people can be brought back for questioning. White collar crime is notoriously complex. That is the reason, in view of all the banking and financial scandals, that we brought in new legislation in this country. We have made it an offence not to provide information, it is an offence not to hand up documents and people can be forced to be subjected to questioning. However, all of that legislation can be avoided by somebody simply taking a one-way flight to Boston, New York or wherever. That shows there is a huge gap in our detection system. The likes of David Drumm are laughing at us because he cannot even be questioned and that all it takes is a one-way flight to put oneself beyond the reach of Irish authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Will the Minister look at that issue? We should be able to co-operate with the US on this and we should use our diplomatic relationship with it in this regard. There would be absolute outrage in the United States if the likes of Bernie Madoff, or anybody else it has held to account, was able to escape justice or even questioning by leaving its jurisdiction. It would not stand for it, nor should we. I urge the Minster to put in place effective mechanisms to ensure we are not waiting around for five years to see if somebody can be brought back. We need to work with the US and our other partners on this issue to ensure that nobody, no matter how wealthy or how influential, or no matter who his or her friends are, can put himself or herself beyond the jurisdiction of the Irish justice system.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinConway" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">While we all fully agree with the sentiments Senator Power expressed, we must be very careful about how we articulate them given that these matters are still before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> This legislation is the second Bill the Minister has initiated in the House in a matter of days, again using a mechanism available to initiate Bills in the Seanad. We are always very happy to take Bills in the Seanad and to facilitate getting good legislation over the line, given that the Dáil's schedule can sometimes be quite full. We are very happy to sit longer, if necessary, in order to take legislation, which is appropriate and beneficial. This legislation is extremely beneficial and important and gives effect to some decisions made at European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> We all know of people who came to this country, committed simple offences, such as road traffic offences, and were given fines by the Irish courts but who vanished back to their countries. It seems that thousands of fines given to eastern Europeans working here during the Celtic tiger years have never been collected because we were never in a position to do so. This legislation ensures that if somebody is brought before the justice system in this country and receives a fine, he or she will not get away with not paying it by just going back home. Similarly, if an Irish person commits an offence, is fined by a court in some other part of Europe and decides to come home, he or she will certainly not be able to walk away from the justice system which found him or her guilty. It is a simple but very important thing. That is a very simple example of something which is probably much more elaborate and which will have many more benefits in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> In many ways, the co-operation between European countries, about which the Minister spoke, already exists but it probably has not had the proper framework to ensure we maximise its efficiencies. If we face a serious criminal situation and require the expertise, whether equipment or personnel, of some of our European colleagues, at least this legislation will ensure there are no barriers to accessing that expertise. This is a small country with a population of 4 million. We are not expected to ensure we have world class expertise in all scenarios, nor do we have the resources to do so. This ensures there is a legal basis for us to accept help from our friends if an unforeseen crisis emerges. It is all very well until the crisis emerges when it is discovered that we do not have a legal framework in place and the Dáil and the Seanad must put through emergency legislation to ensure we can avail of the assistance of our neighbours. This is being proactive as opposed to reactive. That is what I call good legislation. The Eurojust principle, where magistrates and prosecutors share information in order to improve the judicial system internationally, is extremely important. That type of co-operation has existed for many years but the Eurojust project has again brought some formality to it. </p>
          <p eId="para_395"> There are technical aspects to this legislation but it is fairly self-explanatory. We do not need long-winded debates in this House on the technical nature of legislation but rather debates on the broad principles of what is better law. I wholeheartedly welcome this legislation and hope it will get unanimous support because it makes sense. We all recognise the challenges international crime poses in terms of dealing with it. This legislation ensures the processes are streamlined and that there are no blockages. In terms of the specific example to which Senator Power referred, there are hundreds if not thousands of examples on a smaller scale where this legislation will ensure the channels are clear and there are no blockages. In that sense, I welcome the legislation and look forward to the debates on Committee and Report Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">Go raibh míle maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, agus céad fáilte romhat, a Aire agus ach an oiread le mo chomhghleacaithe tá áthas ormsa bheith anseo le tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille ag an staid seo. Aontaímid go bprionsabal leis an méid atá á chur chun cinn ag an Rialtas ar an gceann seo ach measaimid go bhféadfaí b'fhéidir é a leasú ag staid an choiste agus é a láidriú agus a neartú ó thaobh chuid de na rudaí ata istigh ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Sinn Féin will support this Bill's passage to Committee Stage but once there, we will seek to amend it in order to strengthen some of the provisions contained therein. Sinn Féin is not opposed in principle to inter-jurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension. We want to see a scenario where such co-operation is authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to the necessary, and where appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms are in place. Sinn Féin strongly supports effective action against cross-border organised crime, including trafficking of human beings and drugs. Sinn Féin will examine the Bill closely to ensure it will serve to reinforce justice on a European level rather than undermine it. We will work to strengthen it as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Information lawfully obtained in the Irish jurisdiction should only be made available to, and used by, the authorities in another state for a legitimate purpose, that is, for the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences that are analogous to offences within the Irish jurisdiction or for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public safety in another state, provided that a criminal investigation is subsequently conducted. These are the circumstances under which we accept it would be reasonable and responsible and in the public interest to share information with other police services. However, the sharing of Garda or police intelligence should not happen for its own sake when there is no criminal investigation or no immediate public threat as this potentially goes against the public good and violates the right to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Sinn Féin does not support the development of an EU super-state architecture in respect of justice matters and, for this reason, it opposed the EU five-year justice and home affairs harmonisation plan, known as the Hague programme, which ran from 2005 to 2010. The party does not support the creation of a so-called European legal area with a European criminal code and a European public prosecutor. Sovereignty over justice matters must remain firmly in the hands of the people of the EU member states. </p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Beyond this, however, Sinn Féin has adopted a general policy of critical engagement on EU policies and legislative proposals. This means it is willing to support those it believes would be of benefit to the Irish people and to oppose those it believes would be detrimental. Sinn Féin supports measures that genuinely combat international crime or assist legitimate freedom of movement. However, our MEPs, Deputies, MLAs and Ministers will oppose any EU measures that are not fully human rights-compliant and consistent with international law. </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> Sinn Féin rejects the federalist trend towards incremental integration and centralisation of policing and judicial powers, ending in the eventual establishment of an EU border guard, EU police and an EU public prosecutor. Sinn Féin believes that these are matters for sovereign states. Further to this, Sinn Féin also rejects the accelerating impetus to harmonise criminal law between EU members because it is being done without first ensuring the harmonisation of rights protections which currently vary widely from state to state. </p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I wish to briefly mention another concern which relates to data protection issues. Any data collected under the legislation should have to comply with our standards in the Twenty-six Counties and not those of any other member state. We do not want to see a situation in which data shared in good faith leaves the hands of another member state which is no longer under the standard at which it left Ireland. We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area. As a party, we call not only for international co-operation on matters such as this, but also for a strong all-Ireland and all-island policing policy for these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">If the Minister is willing to indulge me, yesterday we had an interesting day with the budget. I noticed an anomaly in the Minister’s budget in the Department of Justice and Equality around equality and integration where there seems to be a cut of 30% with the budget decreasing from €22 million to €15 million. Is there a specific reason for it and how will it affect the equality and integration issues which we have raised with the Minister so often here? Most of my colleagues in the Seanad have supported the recent statements by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, on direct provision. As the senior Minister in the portfolio, does Deputy Fitzgerald share his views? Will they both work together? This will need to be an all-Government policy if direct provision is to change. It was raised here that President Higgins had hoped to visit a direct provision centre in Athlone. We are told it was blocked by the Department. Is it true?</p>

I welcome the Minister and thank her for taking this debate on the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014. The Bill is very important legislation which will greatly assist in combatting criminality within borders where the protagonist may have absconded and seeks to evade prosecution and arrest for national crimes. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand requests for such assistance must be made by a court or tribunal of the country involved and any other authority, such as ministries, departments of justice, attorneys general and public prosecutors can also make requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> The purpose of this amendment Bill is to give full legal effect to six international legal instruments which we have already ratified here in the Oireachtas. It will give national legal effect to a number of European Council framework decisions. The first of these decisions is that member states recognise and execute financial penalty orders issued by a court in another member state. Once this Bill becomes law it will mean fines in excess of €70 imposed in other countries can be collected here in Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>. The Bill will also give effect to a decision to recognise and execute confiscation orders issued by a court. This is an important aspect of the legislation. Many of us in Ireland would be well informed particularly by the media of convicted drug dealers living it up on the proceeds of their crimes in various parts of Europe. This framework decision will allow confiscation orders take effect in other member states to which the proceeds of crime have been trafficked for the criminals’ use and benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> The Bill will improve co-operation between member states in man-made crisis situations, such as terrorism incidents, only when a single member state may not have the means to deal with it alone. Given the increasing threat of attack from various factions in recent years, it is clear that all member states could mutually benefit from increased co-operation in this regard. While some countries are to the forefront of staving off these threats and have the knowledge, intelligence and capacity to deal with them, others have not built up the same intelligence over the years. As a consequence, this framework decision will bolster operations in these countries for the good of Europe and the western world. This is very welcome. The Bill will allow increased co-operation between Eurojust, which deals with judicial co-operation in criminal matters and other agencies, for example the European Anti-fraud Office, OLAF, which investigates fraud against the EU budget, and Europol, which handles criminal intelligence. The effect of this council decision will be strengthened Eurojust operational capabilities with far reaching ability to deal with threats.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The Bill will also give full legal effect to enhanced procedural rights for persons where decisions are rendered in the absence of that person concerned at the trial. This is an important provision given the numbers who are a flight risk when criminal proceedings have been issued or may be issued. Senator Power mentioned an incident in which a person evaded the possibility of criminal proceedings being brought against him. It is in the public interest that, irrespective of where someone of such largesse has escaped to, there are mechanisms to prevent the person from evading justice on any such issue as the law provides. Finally, the Bill will give full effect to an agreement between Japan and EU member states for mutual legal assistance based on existing provisions of the 2008 Act which is in force here.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> The main thrust of the Bill is to ensure closer co-operation between the legal systems of the countries signed up to the process so that issues pertaining to the investigation of serious international crime can be assisted in the wider public interest. For instance, the Bill will increase citizens' and sovereign security in that it will allow for the facilitation of the gathering of evidence for use in jurisdictions abroad, freezing or confiscation of the proceeds of crime, and will assist with the service of legal documents. Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity among its members, the adoption of common rules in the field of mutual assistance in criminal matters will not only contribute to the attainment of this aim but will make criminality without borders, whereby a criminal can become immune to prosecution by moving to another country, a thing of the past within the EU member states and Japan. It is great to see that becoming something that is outdated and outmoded. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Terry Brennan<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_415">I welcome the Minister. The Bill deals with the mutual assistance of international co-operation in criminal matters. Mutual legal assistance is how countries formally request and provide assistance on criminal investigations or proceedings in another country. The Bill amends the Criminal justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, the principal Act, and gives effect to a number of EU framework decisions, which the Minister mentioned, and European Council decisions on mutual assistance. These changes aim to increase co-operation with other EU member states and Japan in tackling crime. The Minister published the Criminal justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill in August. In announcing the proposals, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_416">Crime does not recognise international borders. It is important, therefore, that the reach of our laws can also extend beyond our own borders. I expect that this Bill will be particularly useful in targeting cross-border offenders who commit offences and in confiscating proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">As one who lives on the Border, and one of the closest Senators to the Border, I have been subjected to crime. Within four minutes, a criminal can cross the Border and it is very difficult. I am glad the Bill will give us the legal framework to follow up and enhance co-operation between both police forces. Crime happens in many of our Border counties, and the criminals escape. Hopefully, co-operation will increase and we will apprehend those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Criminals repeat crimes. Recently, I heard of a man who was travelling on a boat to Scotland. He saw the registration of a jeep and, assuming the owner of the jeep was on board, had an announcement made to ask the owner of the jeep to meet him.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The jeep had been stolen and was on its way to Scotland for whatever reason. The Bill will enhance the possibility of bringing such perpetrators to justice. I welcome and support the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I thank all of the Senators who made contributions to this Bill here today for the thoughtful nature of them. Everybody recognised the importance of these directives in tackling crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Certainly, the question of borders does not apply to a lot of crime, as Senator Brennan stated. So much crime is now cross-border and international, and needs to be dealt with by international mechanisms. We need to strengthen all our international mechanisms, within and, as Senator Power referenced, outside of the EU. This is an ongoing issue that we will have to monitor carefully and on which we will have to continue to develop our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I attended the Global Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Online which was held recently between the US and the EU. The only way that we will be able to deal effectively with that crime, and the crimes of human trafficking, drugs, criminal laundering, is by international co-operation between our states and by, as I stated already, police forces co-operating in more intelligence-led operations, following the money and sharing police intelligence. That is increasingly necessary. We need more sophisticated legislation in order to deal effectively with this criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> I thank all the Senators for their contributions. Senator Power spoke about the importance of working internationally in this way and the international co-operation that is needed. She referenced the recent successful operation of the coast of Cork which resulted in €80 million worth of drugs, which were being attempted to be imported illegally, being found. That was a perfect example of the kind of international co-operation that is being carried out. In fact, a lot of it goes unnoticed. When we see that sort of successful operation, it is important to recognise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Senator Power spoke about the importance of the Naval Service, and I agree with her. Many years ago, as a spokesperson on Defence for Fine Gael, I wrote a paper on the importance of the Naval Service. I am pleased to see in yesterday's budget from the Department of Defence that yet another naval ship has been commissioned. It will help in the kind of operations at sea about which she spoke. Senator Conway, likewise, commented on the importance of this legislation and the need to have more instruments that we can use in order to be effective in tackling cross-border crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Senator Ó Clochartaigh made a number of points. I thank him for supporting this legislation. I take his point that it is important that legislation that impacts across borders between countries respects fundamental human rights. I certainly would not disagree with that. In particular, he mentioned data protection. I would say that the balance is between the right to privacy and the right to have intelligence information that will help in dealing with criminal activity. We must strike that balance, and it is quite difficult to get it right because we must ensure in data protection that there is also access to necessary information that will help law enforcement. Equally, the right to privacy must be respected. That is something that is very much on the minds of the Justice Ministers from across the EU. This was discussed last week in Luxembourg at the most recent Justice and Home Affairs meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> In answer to Senator Ó Clochartaigh's question on the Equality Vote, the only reason the Vote is down is because we have made provision for an independent Vote for the new commission of €6 million. The new commission is being given its own budget to deal with its own affairs and it has come out of the Equality Vote in the Department of Justice and Equality. There is no reduction other than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> On the role of the President in this area, the President is independent and makes his own decisions. I would just make that comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> As far as the Garda fleet is concerned, urgent investment was needed in the Garda fleet. I was pleased to be able to announce that there will be 400 new vehicles because the fleet is old. This will make a difference and will add to the fleet that is there. Every year there is a proportion of cars that go off the road because of the amount of mileage on them and they are beyond the date on which they should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I thank Senator Higgins for her support and the points she made on the Bill. She asked specifically about the decisions and whether they must be made by a court. The definition section of the Bill deals with that. What it states is that if the decision, for example, in relation to a fine, is being pursued, it must have gone through court proceedings. The Bill states, "an authority of the issuing State other than a court in respect of a criminal offence under the law of the issuing State, provided that the person concerned has had an opportunity to have the case tried by a court having jurisdiction in particular in criminal matters". The conditions under which various bodies can send on the fine are laid down under the definition section of the Bill. There are those safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I thank Senator Brennan for his comments about cross-border crime. That is an issue of concern in a number of areas. I recently met the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, co-chaired by Deputy Feighan, which is dealing with this and we had a useful discussion on fuel smuggling, cigarette smuggling and the various issues which are of particular North-South relevance. That is an ongoing challenge for both the PSNI and An Garda Síochána. I am pleased to tell the House that there is good co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda. Such co-operation is probably at an all time high.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I thank the Members of the House for their contribution to the Second Stage of this important legislation here today.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinConway" eId="spk_262">

          <p eId="para_434">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_435">That Seanad Éireann–</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_436">- recognises the role of joint policing committees in facilitating consultation, cooperation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda Síochána, local authorities and elected local representatives;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_437">- recognises the work of joint policing committees in facilitating the participation of the community and voluntary sectors in policing matters;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_438">- recognises the contribution of joint policing committees to the work of An Garda Síochána in the area of community policing;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_439">- calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider the enhancement of the role of the joint policing committees to include a collaborative approach on the part of all the joint policing committee members to realise their considerable potential to benefit local communities;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_440">- calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline the implications for joint policing committees in light of the local government reforms and the establishment of the planned policing authority; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_441">- calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider ways to support and improve the operation of joint policing committees and how they might add value to the work of local authorities, the gardaí and community organisations to include input from stakeholders who are not joint policing committee members.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">In the first instance, I thank the Minister for coming in to deal with this matter herself. In terms of Private Members' motions, since I took over as the Fine Gael justice spokesperson in the Seanad over a year ago, it is her third Private Members' motion. The first one was on restorative justice, the second was on community courts and this one is on joint policing committees. I have always tried to be constructive with our Private Members' time, particularly our Private Members' motions. As the Minister will be aware, thankfully, the House unanimously supported the motions on restorative justice and community courts. Sometimes commentators wonder whether the work of the Seanad gets noticed but the fact that it has been announced by the Minister that there will be a community court piloted in Dublin in the near future is testament to the fact that even a Government under pressure with resources is willing to look at alternative and innovative new ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> In terms of the joint policing committees, there has been a fundamental change in local government following the local elections in May last which resulted in dramatically reduced councils, the amalgamation of a number of city and county councils and the abolition of town councils. That fundamental change certainly will impact on the newly formatted joint policing committees. Instead of having 114 joint policing committees, there will be 31.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I acknowledge the work done Fianna Fáil in Government for passing the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which introduced joint policing committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">They were piloted until 2008 and then they were rolled out on a national basis. Up until now the system of joint policing committees has been piloted. The real work of policing committees will probably start with those formed as a result of the local elections last May. There is no doubt that some of the local joint policing committees were very successful. Others were not so successful, but the important thing is that many lessons and better ways of doing business have been learned from the experience of the joint policing committees since 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> I am happy to acknowledge the role of Fianna Fáil when it was in government in establishing the joint policing committees. The challenge for us is to ensure that they work better and that whatever lessons were to be learned have been learned. To that end, the Government must be commended for initiating a review in 2012, which saw up to 60 submissions on how we can do our business better. That review has now been incorporated into the new guidelines on the new joint policing committees, which were issued by the Department to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> One of the big lessons that we can learn - and that hopefully will be learned - about making joint policing committees more successful, is to ensure that there is effective community involvement. Until now community involvement was haphazard, to say the least. The first port of call in examining the pulse of a community is the councillors and then to a lesser extent, though still important, Members of the Oireachtas. Policing committees are currently driven by the elected councillors that serve on them but in order to give an overall flavour of what is happening on the ground, to ensure that the policing plans - the one-year and six-year plans, which are regarded in the new guidelines as being critical - are effective, the community involvement must improve. I welcome the Minister's proposal that local policing committees in each county be given leverage to identify appropriate people within community groups to participate. What may be appropriate in Cork may not work in Clare, and what is appropriate in both Cork and Clare may not work in Galway, so this scope for joint policing committees to identify appropriate local community involvement on the committees must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> We must learn the lessons from all the policing committees and that must be channelled into one overall report. There is a statutory obligation on policing committees to publish a report, which is made available to the Minister, but there is much to be said for putting all the reports together into one overarching report, which could be examined by the justice committee on an annual basis, because there is no point in having policing committees unless they feed into national policy as well as providing important local involvement. The joint policing committees are, in effect, giving a statutory format and mechanism to what has existed in our communities on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for decades. There has been over many years a great relationship between the community and An Garda Síochána and, indeed, between public representatives and An Garda Síochána. Unfortunately, with the modernisation of society and, to a large extent, the urbanisation of society, many gardaí who would have lived and worked in certain divisions now do not live in the division and just come to work there. This may be a good thing in many ways - their free time is their free time. The understanding of the local garda, who lived and worked in the community - and may even have lived in the Garda station - has diminished. Once that local knowledge and sense of community involvement and feedback - and the sense communities had that they were listened to - as a result of that old-style, <i>ad hoc</i> structure dissolved to a large extent, we had to look at doing something on a more formalised basis. Given the many welcome changes taking place within An Garda Síochána, including the new policing authority and the appointment of a new Commissioner early next year, it is imperative that we ensure that the joint policing committees play a fundamental role in the new policing that we will experience over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> On the amendments to the motion, the amendment tabled by Fianna Fáil merely outlines cutbacks and what has been done and so on. I mean no disrespect to the people who have tabled it, but I do not feel it is relevant to this particular motion. This motion is specifically about joint policing committees. It does not deal with Garda resources, reductions in the number of vehicles, closing of Garda stations, and so on. On those points, I welcome what the Minister announced in the budget yesterday. We will certainly see a firming up of the Garda fleet and new recruits in Templemore over the coming months. Perhaps the budget - or so I would hope - has addressed many of the concerns that were expressed in this amendment, so Fianna Fáil may consider not pressing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The amendment tabled by Sinn Féin presents food for thought. The new guidelines will probably address many of Sinn Féin's concerns - the public meetings it calls for joint policing committees to carry out, and so on. Many joint policing committees are already holding that type of meeting. Either way, I welcome the debate. I am glad people tabled amendments because it means that they are exercised by the motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The future of the joint policing committees is very bright and their role is very important. It is essential that we ensure that the next five years of the joint policing committees are even more successful than the last five or six years. It is new to Ireland, it is a relatively new initiative, but now is the time to bed it down and to ensure it really works on behalf of the people of Ireland - to ensure that there is proper, effective consultation, communication, understanding between public representatives, community groups and, indeed, An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryBrennan" eId="spk_263" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Senator Terry Brennan<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_453">I second the motion. As Senator Conway has stated, a total of 31 joint policing committees will operate in the city and county council areas that remain after the recent change to local government structures. Joint policing committees should take a strategic and collaborative approach to policing issues. Committees are encouraged to hold meetings in different parts of each local authority. That is a good idea and takes place in my own county, Louth. The making of an annual report, which is the statutory duty of JPCs, is emphasised. There are new requirements for JPCs to develop six-year and annual strategic plans and proper communication strategies to support interaction with local communities. I cannot overemphasise the importance of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> In relation to community representatives, each JPC should decide the most appropriate community-based organisations or groups to be represented. In doing so, joint policing committees should have regard to relevant guidelines on community representation, which may be issued by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The guidelines also state that to the greatest extent possible the objectives of achieving a 40% gender balance in the making of appointments, as well as the need to foster social inclusiveness and equality when selecting membership, should be adhered to.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">"To delete all words after 'Seanad Éireann' and substitute the following:</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_469">-	develop a new national criminal justice strategy to improve the functioning of our court and prison systems."</p>
          <p eId="para_470">In proposing the amendment, I am not doing so in an adversarial or cantankerous way, but justice is such a major remit. I wish the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, well in her portfolio. It is not an easy task; it is huge and unwieldy and one of the most demanding ministerial portfolios. I do so to highlight a number of issues. I am aware that in the Budget Statement there was a mention of extra gardaí which I welcome but there has been a substantial reduction in numbers from 14,500 in 2010 to approximately 12,900 today. I acknowledge that in the Budget Statement there is a mention of another tranche of new gardaí, but 139 Garda stations have been closed throughout the country. Many of these are in rural areas, including west Cork, such as in Goleen which is a peripheral area where one of the largest finds of cocaine to be brought into the country was found off Dunlough Bay. Local gardaí in remote peninsulas have a very important role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Some 17 courthouses have been closed since 2011. My constituency is remote and peripheral. Castletownbere is a 90-minute to two-hour drive from Cork city and its courthouse has been closed. The Beara peninsula has no courthouse, while Schull, Glengarriff, Dunmanway and Kinsale courthouses have been closed. The Courts Service now plans to close Skibbereen courthouse and the plan is to have one major Garda station in west Cork. If a person in Sheep's Head peninsula, Mizen, Allihies or Goleen is charged with having bald tyres, he or she has to go to Bandon courthouse. As there are no Luas or bus services in the area, one has a drive of 90 minutes to get to the courthouse. I raised this matter with the Law Society, and I do not place the blame on the Minister, because it is an issue of major significance for the West Cork Bar Association, of which I was formerly a member and a former secretary. I met the president and chairperson and people such as a former colleague, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, are concerned at the decline and loss of courthouses in rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_472"> An issue that annoyed the west Cork barristers is that in Dublin where a number of courthouses were due to be closed, one of which was in Dundrum, the Law Society met the Minister's predecessor and said the courthouses could not close, following which the plans to close courthouses in Dublin were reversed. While the Minister may say this is a matter for the Courts Service, her predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, met representatives of the Law Society and whatever Bar association and prevented the closure of courthouses in Dublin. There is no place in Dublin or the greater Dublin area that is as remote as places in west Cork or Donegal where many small courthouses are being closed. I accept that it may be reasonable to close courthouses such as Glengarriff and Dunmanway but it is a question of where does the buck stop. When I was a young solicitor and prior to that time, there was always a Circuit Court in Bantry but that is closed. If one has to go to the Circuit Court, it appears one will have to use the Cork city services. That is a local hobby horse issue. As there appears to be a race to the bottom in the closing of Garda stations and courthouses, I ask the Minister to take the issue on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Our amendment recognises that many of our prisons are over capacity and that more than 600 prisoners are on temporary release. I wish to highlight the fact that murder increased in Ireland by 33% between the second quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. It is a frightening statistic that murders in Ireland in a given year have increased by a third while burglary offences increased by 1,072 and theft offences increased by 930 in Dublin in the same period. I know the Minister has to be vigilant and ensure that burglaries, thefts and the heinous crime of murder, in so far as possible, can be controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> We agree that thousands of bench warrants and court summons which remain outstanding fundamentally undermine our criminal justice system. I read today, with some concern, of a district judge in some part of Ireland who threw out hundreds of speeding summons on a technicality. Lives are being lost on the roads because of speeding. When I was a young solicitor, there was a famous case, Duggan <i>v</i>. Evans, in which the particular decision of the High Court was that justice should not be denied on the basis of technicalities. Perhaps that is an issue the Minister would have a look at again.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> We believe that a new dedicated Garda Síochána public order unit should be established for Dublin city centre where anti-social behaviour on the capital's main thoroughfares is common. On a number of occasions in the past two or three years, Senator Tom Sheahan said it was not safe to walk O'Connell Street and many other streets in Dublin at night. That is an awful statement but I am sure he made it in good faith given the chances of being mugged or attacked.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I call on the Government to outline its plans to tackle the prevalence of drugs in both urban and rural areas in Ireland. As a result of measures undertaken by this and previous Governments, the drug problem in Limerick has been stymied and, hopefully, diminished. It has been a great success but it took a great deal of Garda resources. That effort will have to be duplicated in Dublin in so far as possible. I am not saying it is the Minister's fault - it is society's fault - but it is sad that hardly a week goes by when a person is not shot in a bar by gangsters. We have to be extra vigilant. That is the reason we say that extra efforts have to be made in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> The Minister has a very large Department. In any legislation she introduces the major difficulty for her is financial resources. I do not propose our amendment in a spurious way or in an effort to be antagonistic but we rarely have general debates. I appreciate what my colleague, Senator Martin Conway, said in that the motion has to do with policing and the new committees that have been set up, but I would question their success rate. It is good to have a general debate on law and order and on justice matters. This was an appropriate vehicle for us to propose this amendment.</p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_478">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to the House. It is always welcome to have debates on justice matters, particularly on policing, and the day after the budget when there has been a welcome announcement of increased funding for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote of €140 million since budget day last year, including a 68% increase in capital funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I commend Senator Martin Conway and his Fine Gael colleagues on tabling the motion, which is specifically about joint policing committees. In tabling the amendments, Fianna Fáil, in particular, has broadened the ambit of the debate to cover policing more generally. The Sinn Féin amendment more directly addresses the issue of joint policing committees. I do not think there is a significant amount of difference between all of us on the amendments or the motion and we tend to have constructive debates on justice in this House and in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on which Senators Conway, O'Donovan and I serve. We should approach the motion in a constructive manner because this is not an issue on which it is appropriate to conduct an adversarial debate as there is much common ground in the amendments and in the motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> In regard to the more general issues of policing raised in the amendments, the Fianna Fáil amendment recognises that our prisons are over capacity and that more than 600 prisoners are on temporary release. I would point out that in recent years we have witnessed a real drop in the numbers of persons in our prisons which is a welcome development. In the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality we produced a report on penal reform which called for reductions in the numbers of people imprisoned. We have seen the development of a very successful community return programme which has had positive outcomes in terms of lowering recidivism rates. We are seeing real progress being made in the prison system to reduce the use of prison and to ensure that people are getting better rehabilitation. We also see a reduction in crime figures. I am aware the Fianna Fáil amendment highlights certain increases but it should also acknowledge general decreases in crime rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">In terms of what the Fianna Fáil amendment calls on the Government to do, the announcement made in the Budget Statement yesterday answers many of the issues raised. We are all delighted to welcome not only the increase in capital funding but the fact that recruitment has commenced in the Garda Síochána. We have seen that 100 recruits commenced training in September and that there will be an intake of 200 more recruits to Templemore next year. That is really positive. Another positive is the investment in the Garda fleet with €10 million secured for more than the much-needed 400 new Garda vehicles. It has become quite fashionable to refer to the "Love/Hate" programme in the context of the budget, but I was struck by a comment of one of the gardaí in the programme about the quality of the car he was being forced to drive in pursuit of one of Nidge's gang. I am sure the announcement in the budget will resolve the issue of inadequate vehicles being used by the Garda in this scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Apart from resourcing, it is important to note other reforms that have been made in terms of policing more generally. Certainly at the start of the year there was a major focus on identified weaknesses in our policing system and problems with the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which itself was a reforming Act introduced by a previous Government. We have seen in the months since those issues emerged, in particular through the Guerin report, how these weaknesses and problems in policing can be resolved. I have welcomed in the House already the announcement that we will have a new policing authority. This is a significant reform. An independent policing authority has been Labour Party policy for some time and is in keeping with the model of policing in Northern Ireland. It is very welcome that a new commissioner will be recruited through a new process.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> Within the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, as the Minister is well aware, we conducted our own review of the reforms that are needed to the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and that report on the reforms that we published last week following extensive hearings makes a series of recommendation that will enhance and improve the conduct of policing in Ireland, in particular the oversight of policing. We made recommendations on reforming the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission which are really important, in particular the proposal that we have a single Garda ombudsman instead of a three-person model as at present and that the Garda Síochána ombudsman would have the power to conduct investigations on his or her own initiative and indeed that all members of the force, including the commissioner, would become accountable to the new Garda Síochána ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> We also made other important recommendations that did not receive the same publicity. Anyone reading the Guerin report would have been really struck by the problems he identified with the inadequate supervision of probationer gardaí. Our recommendations on that topic, namely, that adequate supervision of the activity of probationer gardaí be made a requirement, is a really important recommendation as indeed is the one that we would see improved training and resourcing of gardaí. Now that we see recruitment of the Garda being recommenced it is a very good time to implement these recommendations to consider, for example, allowing the establishment of an officer rank, as in the Metropolitan Police in London, where there is direct entry to the police for graduates. There are a number of important proposals. We have recommended opening up the Garda Síochána to Freedom of Information requests. These are the more general recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Turning to Senator Conway's specific theme of joint policing committees, I very much welcome the outcome of the review process, which has led, as we know, to new guidelines being published by the Minister in August of this year on the operation of joint policing committees. All of us who have been involved in joint policing committees, JPCs, will be aware of how effective they are in terms of maintaining a link between the community and the police. There has undoubtedly been duplication. If one goes to a local neighbourhood watch meeting, the community Garda is present and often a couple of people from the community gardaí. In Portobello, where I live, we have excellent relations with the community garda but one does feel there can be duplication and too much focus on relatively minor incidents where one has such a large number of JPCs as we had under the previous system in accordance with the 2008 guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I welcome the rationalisation of JPCs and the fact that the JPCs will operate to tightened up procedures under the new guidelines. I welcome the increased focus on community policing. That is an important aspect of Senator Conway's motion, namely, that we would see community policing being given the status it deserves. For far too long, not just in the Garda Síochána, but in police forces generally, community policing was seen as the lowest level of policing that was somehow less important than other sorts of policing. I am glad to say that we have 876 dedicated community gardaí deployed nationwide. It is important that we would have a community policing ethos, informing all levels of the Garda service. It is of major importance that it would be seen as a job that can lead to promotion in the Garda. All of us will have examples, as I have, of excellent local community garda work, not just in terms of detection and investigation of offences committed, but crime prevention as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_487"> It is very useful that we have this opportunity to focus on this very specific aspect of policing. We all agree on the need for reform of JPCs to make them more effective. We all approve and appreciate the work that they do and I think that is what unites us on both sides of the House. Many of the points made in the Fianna Fáil amendment in particular on a more general sense about policing are in fact in train and are being dealt with. We all recognise the need for reforms, for increased recruitment and so on, but these are measures that ongoing. I commend the Minister for her work on this.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_488">I strongly welcome the motion tabled by Senator Conway. I do not believe it requires any amendment whatever. The other amendments on several but related issues are inappropriate. I do not disagree with anything that is said in them but they are not relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I should declare an interest. Some years ago I was sent an invitation - as I think were all Members of the House - to join a local joint policing committee. I joined the north inner city policing committee and we meet in City Hall. I have found these meetings extremely valuable. We get representation from local community groups who report their concerns and specific issues of policing that worry them. The police are there in force at a senior level and they give reports about crime in the area, statistics, variation and these are probed by the public representatives at those meetings. It gives an opportunity for local communities to be represented in an arena where it matters and where one can have a clear result.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> In addition, traditionally the Dublin city manager has organised on a twice yearly basis lunches in City Hall, where material is presented about the way in which the city is going. The people involved are those on the joint policing committee, although there may be one or two extra people. We have had slideshows and other presentations. I think these are extremely positive developments. I was very glad to be involved. I have not had an invitation since I was unwell but it may be just that it is being re-organised. Every opportunity I have had to go there was a positive experience where our concerns were taken seriously, dealt with and a practical resolution occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> The first amendment in the names of the Fianna Fáil Members is redundant. They are dealing with separate issues. We know that Garda numbers have fallen and that is definitely regrettable. I accept that but it has nothing whatever to do with joint policing committees - it is to do with policing levels. It refers to the closure of 139 Garda stations and 17 courthouses since 2011. I gather the closing of courthouses has started to level off and has stopped, but I think it would be a very good idea if the police authorities were encouraged to be honest about it and to stop telling lies. They closed the police station around the corner from me off Parnell Street. I cannot remember the name of the street, it is where Dicey Reilly used to parade but it was a big station built in the 1930s. They said it was closed for redecoration, but they have kept open one little room in a Georgian house next door and recently - having told us they were restoring the building - it has re-emerged as a hostel for the homeless. This is ridiculous. If they will not tell the truth to public representatives, where are we? We would like to know the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The amendment also refers to the numbers in prison that are over the capacity of the building. I think it would be much better to start closing prisons and to only put in prison people who are a danger to themselves or to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The building of prisons is a complete waste of time. The amendment notes that murder in Ireland increased by 33% and calls on the Government to do this, that or the other, all of which is redundant. It is the subject of another motion and is not relevant. An amendment should address directly the subject of the main motion and this amendment does not so do. Therefore, I appeal to my Fianna Fáil colleagues not to put it to a vote. If they do, I will linger around and will vote with the Government on this one because I consider it to be an excellent motion on which Senator Conway and his colleagues ought to be commended. If Fianna Fáil or Sinn Féin Members wish to table other motions, that is good because there is room for all of them. Members can then discuss such matters but can do so in the proper context. As a House, Members should unite behind the joint policing committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> I will turn briefly to the Sinn Féin amendment. It recommends that all joint policing committees regularly convene public meetings. As far as I am aware, the meetings of joint policing committees are open to the public and so they could constitute public committees. Members of the public rarely attend and reporters rarely attend but do occasionally. Consequently, I consider these to be public meetings. Moreover, senior gardaí and appropriate local authority staff are in attendance. As for representatives of statutory agencies, they are called from time to time. As for this business about how there should be a minimum of four meetings per annum, it sounds like one of the elements of the late Myles na gCopaleen in which one might ask, "Is this a committee meeting or what? We will have four committee meetings a year". How does one know that four meetings are needed? Moreover, why is it necessary to set the dates a year in advance? This is all hogwash that simply has been put down for the sake of covering paper with print.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The Sinn Féin amendment further recommends that the Garda representative should present a report at each meeting in written format, including statistical data. They already do this but the only point I would make is most of this information is taken back from us at the end of the meetings. I suppose this is for reasons of confidentiality or whatever - I do not know - but we already get these reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> This is an excellent motion that supports a very positive initiative. It should have strong support from all sides of the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AverilPower" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Senator Averil Power<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_497">I second the amendment to the motion tabled by my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, and will explain the rationale behind Fianna Fáil's decision to table an amendment that refers to resources. In common with Senator Norris, I am a member of my local joint policing committee, at which we take reports on activity in the area and the work the Garda is doing. In addition, at every meeting we also discuss the issue of resources because it is a difficulty for the gardaí locally. It is bizarre to divorce the idea of the joint policing committees from the resources the Garda is given to do its job. The committees are excellent and are good from the perspective of public representatives. I find them to be very useful in terms of interacting with the Garda and with council officials because it is often the case that were the council to do its job properly in brightening up areas that are subject to anti-social behaviour because they are dark alleyways or overgrown lane-ways and so on, it would result in the Garda being obliged to dedicate fewer resources to such matters. Consequently, it is important to have in place those partnerships, to have the local authority and the Garda working together and have public representatives as part of that process. We have held a number of local meetings and while they are not necessarily all that well attended, one gets representatives from community bodies, neighbourhood associations and people like that who interact with the Garda at such meetings, which is very useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> However, the reason Fianna Fáil's amendment refers to resources is because the lack of resources in the justice system and the cuts that have been made in recent years are having a real impact. Moreover, this is reflected in the statistics the Garda presents to us at our joint policing committee meetings. The Minister is more than aware that there has been a huge increase in burglaries in Dublin. There was an increase of 1,000 burglaries last year, which is a serious issue. From my local perspective, it appears to be targeted in particular at areas that contain a lot of elderly people. They appear to be targeting established estates in which there are a lot of older people who are living alone. They go out to mass or bingo or something like that during the week and return only to find their house has been burgled. This is causing a great deal of fear within the community. Similarly, there was a tiger kidnapping in Bayside recently in which, thankfully, the gardaí reacted very well and rapidly and within no time they had apprehended one of those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Again, however, the gardaí can only do that for which they have the resources and in this regard one big issue concerns the Garda fleet. I appreciate that an investment in the Garda fleet was announced yesterday, as was noted by an earlier speaker. However, I am interested in whether that answers the question as to how much this actually will mean. Will it simply mean the replacement of some of the worst cars, on which the mileage is ridiculous? Will it provide proper vehicles to the Garda? The idea of gardaí attempting to chase somebody in a car with 1.4 litre engine is ridiculous, as they need high-speed, high-performance vehicles to be able to keep up with those who are fleeing the scene of a crime, often on motorbikes and so on. Consequently, I consider this to be an essential issue in respect of Garda resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> In addition, the Garda is suffering from a serious manpower problem and I followed with interest the announcement made yesterday about the 200 additional gardaí. Unless I am mistaken, that is the final tranche of the 300 additional gardaí who were announced by the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, last year. All 300 were meant to have been put in place this year in July, September and December. While the July recruitment did not take place, there was recruitment in September and I understand the Minister intends to have further recruitment in December, which I welcome. However, 300 will not even keep up with retirements, which is a point made yesterday by the Garda Representative Association. Approximately 350 people leave the force each year through retirements or for other reasons, yet over the two years only 300 recruits in total will have been brought in, which will not even retain numbers at their present levels. This is a serious issue when one considers the increase in the number of burglaries and that murders and kidnappings have increased by 30%. I believe gardaí do an exceptional job of trying to police neighbourhoods, to keep on top of crime and to have a visible presence, in order that they are not simply apprehending people at the scene of a crime but also are providing a deterrent. However, such visibility has been lacking in recent years and as the Garda Representative Association described it yesterday, 200 additional members is merely a Band-Aid for the Garda in terms of current resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> This is the reason Fianna Fáil referred to resources in its amendment. I fully support the sentiment in the motion regarding the importance of joint policing committees and that deserves cross-party support across the House. I welcome the earlier remarks from Senator Hayden acknowledging that Fianna Fáil in government brought in that system and Fianna Fáil will work with the Government at any level to improve it. There also is room for improvement in making sure the joint policing committees, JPCs, work better and that in particular, the public is kept informed in order that it is not simply public representatives but that there is broader visibility of the committees' work. However, it would be remiss of Members and somewhat strange to discuss the committees without considering the underlying issue of resources because I reiterate it is an issue that comes up constantly at my local JPC. I would be surprised were this not the same nationwide as people's areas are being hit by reductions in the number of gardaí on the street, by vehicles that are not being replaced and by Garda station closures, to which Fianna Fáil's amendment also makes reference. While I support the original motion in that respect, I believe that as a House, Members must send out a strong message that the Minister should be getting greater resources and that the Seanad is behind her in respect of her work at the Cabinet in doing this and in securing greater resources for the Garda in order that it can do its job effectively. It was in this spirit that we tabled the amendment.</p>

          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht fanacht linn don díospóireacht seo. I bprionsabal, táimid ar son an rúin atá curtha chun cinn agus aontaímid le cuid mhaith den mhéid atá ráite. I must note that although Senator Norris thought that most of Sinn Féin's amendments was hogwash, he spent a lot of time talking about it. Moreover, I do not agree with his reading of them. The Sinn Féin amendment in particular is highly pertinent to the motion that has been tabled and I welcome the comments thus far of Senators Conway and Bacik in that regard, which was that in general, they agree with the sentiment being put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I welcome this Private Members' motion and commend Sinn Féin's additions to it. Sinn Féin believes confidence in justice must be created through local and democratic control, which includes civilian oversights and which introduces adequate safeguards while ensuring cultural change within organisations. The justice service, including the policing service, is a public service, and as such it must be open to all and must be representative of and accountable to the people it serves in all their diversity. To fulfil its mandate to serve the people, policing must be free from partisan political control and must be community-centred and community-based.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Policing must conform to the highest standards of human rights, accountability, impartiality, transparency and effectiveness. We must create the conditions necessary to secure widespread, pan-community confidence in policing and justice, and to promote in particular a culture of policing with the community. Policing and justice, and other social services that result in widespread experience of greater security among individuals and communities, must be delivered alongside civilian oversight of policing and justice that is democratic, fully inclusive and robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Sinn Féin believes that what is also needed is a change of culture to one that views crime prevention through deterrence as a multi-agency matter requiring a collaborative strategic response, not just from policing and public services but also from the business and community and voluntary sectors. There is considerable scope for introducing multi-agency crime reduction partnerships and strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The responsibilities of our joint policing committees are wide and varied. They are charged with keeping the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour, including misuse of alcohol and drugs, and the underlying factors contributing to these levels, under review. They are also to advise the local authority and gardaí on how they might best perform their functions; arrange and host public meetings; establish local policing fora in specific neighbourhoods where necessary; and co-ordinate the activities of those fora. Our JPCs also work to assist divisional and district Garda officers with the formulation and operation of annual policing plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> The JPCs could facilitate joint working arrangements through collaborative partnerships between public sector partners and other bodies such as transport providers, those involved in the licensing and late night catering industries, and other relevant social, community and voluntary services to deal more effectively with specific problems emanating from the night-time economies of cities and towns, as well as daily ongoing work to make local communities safer. The aim of such crime reduction partnerships is to produce and implement agreed local crime reduction strategies. Our JPCs are invaluable but they are not nearly strong enough, and that is something we need to work to improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> As regards powers, JPCs are merely advisory and, unlike the Northern district policing partnerships, DPPs, the police are not answerable to them. In 2008, divisional officers simply presented their annual policing plans to some JPCs as a <i>fait accompli</i>, while other JPCs were not given the plans. In any event, JPCs are failing to exercise the powers they have, and not enough public meetings are being held to ensure real and effective partnership with local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> JPCs are also under-resourced, especially compared with their northern DPP counterparts. Funding is essentially for training chairpersons and expenses. It is not clear how much funding, if any, can be used to employ dedicated staff. Currently, JPCs are staffed by already overstretched council staff. Moreover, since 2007, the allocation of funding in the annual budget has changed from the justice Vote to the Garda Vote. This means that the Garda will determine which JPCs get funding and for what purpose. It is a conflict of interest that has the potential to interfere with JPC independence. We need to work to strengthen, support and promote our JPCs to ensure they work for and with our local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> I regularly attend both the city and county JPC in Galway. I am allowed to be a member of one of the JPCs but I can only be an observer at the other one, although they allow me take part in the debates. In a constituency where there is a city and a county JPC, why are Oireachtas Members precluded from sitting on both, which we find very useful? The members on the JPC would often ask the Oireachtas Members to raise a matter to do with national legislation in the Seanad or the Dáil. It is often mentioned that attendance by Oireachtas representatives is not as strong as it could be in that they are invited but they do not attend as often as they could. I find it very useful to attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> I see differences between the two JPCs. One of them has a strong strategic plan which makes great use of the sub-committee structures. It has work plans to which it adheres. The other one does not have a very good strategic plan, and the chair has not allowed that to be put forward. In contrast to what Senator Norris said, the media are regular attendees in both the JPCs in Galway, and most of the issues are covered, but certain politicians use it as a soapbox for their own ends. It is about getting the headline in the local paper as opposed to dealing with the issues at hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I want to raise two issues relating to the JPCs I have attended. I have noticed that at every single city and county JPC meeting there is a discussion about the increase in domestic violence. It is an issue we have not addressed nationally, but it is one we must examine and have more resources available for tackling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The other main issue raised with me, especially regarding Galway city, is the regulation of taxis, especially taxis that are parked in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have bona fide taxi drivers working in the city who have paid their dues and work full-time. They park in the ranks, but rogue taxi drivers will park or pull up anywhere. They pick up people leaving bars and nightclubs, which is taking the trade from those who work by the rules. They do not have an issue with the number of taxi drivers but they have an issue with the way the regulation is being enforced, which should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I commend the motion. The amendment we put forward is in the spirit of the motion and I hope the Government will be able to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to the House and compliment her on the progress she is making since taking office in reforming our justice system. I compliment Senator Martin Conway on bringing forward this motion, given the new scenario that arises as a result of the restructuring of local government. As we know, the number of JPCs will reduce from 114 to 31. The JPCs have been an effective forum for consultation and discussions on matters of crime and policing within each local authority area. They provide an opportunity for local communities to participate meaningfully with the Garda and elected representatives on issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I will give some examples of the effectiveness of the JPC in my town of Ballinasloe, where the town council JPC worked quite effectively. An issue that was raised at a considerable number of meetings was anti-social behaviour arising from the consumption of alcohol in public places. A subgroup of the JPC was established to tackle ongoing issue of street drinkers and people sleeping rough in Ballinasloe and it recommended that a drop-in centre be set up to provide a point of contact for those people. Ballinasloe Town Council provided a premises and the service is now provided and staffed by Galway Simon Community. The Bridge Resource Centre was officially opened in 2012. It opens every day for four or five hours and provides toilet and shower facilities and a comfortable and safe environment for the users in which they can receive help, particularly those experiencing addiction problems and homelessness. That is a practical example of a joint policing committee, the community, the Garda and the elected representatives coming up with practical solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> When anti-social behaviour issues arose in a housing estate, the JPC took a proactive role with the residents associations, the Garda and council staff in having a number of meetings that addressed particular issues. As a result, significant progress was made to the point where residents had pride in their area, entered tidy towns competitions and got involved in a significant number of community activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I was surprised to see the Fianna Fáil motion on the day after the significant investment in policing and Garda resources announced in the budget. I very much welcome that this is the first year since 2008 that there has been a significant investment in Garda resources. There is an increase of €141 million in the overall budget, which includes an increase of 68% in capital funding. I welcome also the recruitment of 200 gardaí in the near future, and that 400 new vehicles will be purchased as a result of a €10 million investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">This is a comprehensive package of budget increases aimed at funding reforms across the policing and justice sector. I would like to make the Minister aware that, as a result of the restructuring that took place within the Garda some time ago, we have seen a significant decrease in criminal activity in places like the town of Ballinasloe. In particular, there has been a 28% decrease in general crimes and burglaries have decreased by 9%. It is not critical that we have a large number of Garda stations but it is critical that we have resources on the ground and that gardaí are out in the community. They must be provided with the resources to do their job in an effective manner. The fact that there are much better technology and communication systems in place now and that in many towns there are effective closed circuit television systems in operation should help significantly with policing activities. </p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I welcome the fact that the joint policing committees are to be reformed. I have some concerns that areas that had a real concentration of such a joint policing committee such as my own town of Ballinasloe might not get the same attention when they are involved in a wider country joint policing committee. We will keep a close eye on that and I will look to serving on that joint policing committee in the coming years. I wish the Minister continued success as she sets about her task of ensuring that our country is a safer place for people to live in and to grow old.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I apologise for the confusion. I had intended to second the motion but I was not aware that the time of the debate was changed from a start time of 5 p.m. to 3.50 p.m. That was my mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I welcome the Minister. I thank Senator Conway for bringing forward this motion, which I welcome. The prevention of crime is not the sole responsibility of the Garda. We all have a part to play. The joint policing committees have an important role to play. Since they were first established on a trial basis and a formal structure was put in place in 2008, they have made a significant difference. It is a very welcome change. It is not that long ago since I attended a meeting of residents in a Garda station when a Garda superintendent would not continue the meeting unless I left. We have come a long way from that. That was in regard to the area around University College Cork that I represented on Cork City Council at that time where there were quite a number of difficulties. On the one hand, there was a elderly population and, on the other, a large number of students descended on the area in late September and early October. We were trying to get gardaí, the college, students and residents to work together. It was interesting that the gardaí involved in the area did not feel that public representatives had a role in that process. The joint policing committees have brought about a change where everyone is involved and that is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The Government gave an undertaking to review the process and that review was carried out. The process is now being changed and hopefully it will provide a better structure and we will learn from the experience of the past. It is important there is more direct involvement of community groups, the Community Alert scheme, the Neighbourhood Watch scheme, the community safety fora, the victim groups and youth organisations. The involvement of all of those groups is extremely important. The Community Alert scheme is effectively used with the involvement of community organisations in rural areas but it could be used far more effectively in urban areas as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I point to an area of concern, where the Community Alert scheme could be effectively used. There was a situation in my area, which is an urban one, and I am not sure if gardaí have looked into this, of people tuning into the radios used by taxi companies. I know of an incident of a person who ordered a taxi and within 20 minutes of leaving their house, someone was casing their property. That individual had listened into the radio of the taxi company and knew the taxi's pick-up address, where the person was going and that the house would be vacant. The Garda needs to examine the use of that type of system of notification of taxi call-outs and the monitoring of that system by individuals. As a result of the area being cased, I contacted the Garda and we found that the people who were casing that particular house has cased a number of other houses in the immediate area during the previous two or three weeks. As a result of sending out an alert in the local area, we identified the most recent house those people had moved on to case. Therefore, it is extremely important to have a Community Alert scheme in urban areas. We need to make sure, especially in areas where there are many retired people, that there is a proper structure in place to provide the necessary protection for them. House alarms provide one source of protection but we need to get the community to work together as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_530"> We still have a good deal of work to do because people can now communicate extremely quickly. It is important that communication systems are used for the protection of people. Feedback to the Garda at the fastest possible rate is important. People need to have the necessary contacts to enable them to use them both at a local level and back to the Garda station as the earliest possible time. A good deal of work has been done on this issue and these committees have worked very effectively since 2008. The reform of the structure is extremely welcome. It is a question of making sure that there is full implementation and full involvement of people across the community from public representatives to sports organisations to youth organisations to community groups. Everyone has a part to play. I look forward to working within the new structure with the changes that have been made and to continue to improve the back-up supports that the Garda require.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">I support our amendment to this motion, which is important. It is a pity the Government motion does not recognise the problems in the Garda force and in the justice system at present. There is a great a lack of morale and great difficulties. Crime rates are increasing. Members of the public do not have any confidence in the crime rates because some people are afraid to report crimes and there are other allegations that crimes are not reported in the way that they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> On the joint policing committees, which are the subject of the motion, it is good that we are having a discussion on them. I have not found them to be very effective bodies. Part of the reason is that up to the time of the local elections we had a joint policing committee for the towns in County Meath, including Trim, Navan and Kells. The one in Kells worked relatively well because it had a defined small geographical area but the County Meath joint policing committee was a difficult one because the county and Garda division of Meath are very large. It was difficult for people to find issues on which they could have commonality to discuss at the meeting. I do not know what the plans are for the future joint policing committees but I would very much suggest that the county ones be removed and that they would be put down to municipal district level and perhaps over time Garda districts and municipal districts could coincide, which they more or less do in County Meath at present. There is huge in that regard. They would work much better at municipal district level than at county level. I am not sure what the involvement of the local authority staff is or should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It is a waste of resources to have local authority staff on these committees. These committees should be a forum between the gardaí and the local representatives. I am not sure what the local authority adds to it. It involves resources that the local authorities do not have to deploy to meetings. I get the impression that the staff who are doing it are so busy with other matters that they do not have, or should not be given, the time to deal with this issue. This would be far more effective if the gardaí, the local representatives and the Oireachtas Members met without reference to the local authority. The local authority has enough to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> One should do it at municipal district level, perhaps with the local district superintendent. Provided the media took an interest because one can raise issues, these could be effective fora for discussion. We are losing the town committees and we need a replacement for them, and the municipal district provides such a forum. I have called for that for quite some considerable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> When joint policing committees first started in 2008, I was excited at the prospect of them coming into being but I have not seen them work as effectively as they should. I am a supporter of the concept but it needs to be much more localised.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> They have not started back up in County Meath. I do not know whether the same is the case around the country. Have they started in other counties?</p>

          <p eId="para_544">Every other body is up and running. The VECs and health forums have numerous meetings and these committees, in my view, because the local authorities have too much to do, are on the back burner. As far as I know, they have not yet started back in County Meath. One should take them out of the local authority administrative structure. It would be far better for the public and a better use of time to have only the representatives and the gardaí, and have them at that more localised level with the local superintendent and the local gardaí rather than with the chief superintendent of a county or division which, in some cases, is made up of two counties.</p>

          <from>Senator Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_545">I welcome the Minister. It is good to see her and I thank her for coming in to take what is obviously a Government motion on joint policing committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> As we all will agree from our experience in each of our areas, I certainly agree with the establishment of the JPCs and the reason that they were established. While some of the changes being proposed are welcome, the joint policing committees can be more efficient. We also must see how they fit in. For example, I am on the Fingal committee. I am aware from representatives in the north inner city where the joint policing committee works well. In other areas, it does not work as well. We need to focus on it to ensure that there is community buy-in.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> We used the opportunity of this Government motion to highlight some of the issues that arise, specifically in Dublin. Being Dublin spokesperson and being from Dublin, I do not mind being selfish about that aspect of it. I have had a lot of interaction in my area, which is the R district. Not to go completely off the point, I would like to get some idea. While there has been acknowledgement of the welcome recruitment of additional gardaí, the force numbers are coming down, from a peak of 14,500 to 12,800 or 12,900. I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald, as Minister, receives regular comments and complaints on the resourcing of the men and women in the Garda who find it increasingly difficult to do their job. One area at which the Acting Garda Commissioner should look - I accept that this would be an operational matter - is that there are far too many instances, for example, in an area like Swords, which is the capital town of Fingal, where there would be one Garda car servicing an area of over 120,000 people, where there would be situations in which there is one garda in a unit, where cars cannot be deployed and where response times are slow because of the lack of gardaí and the lack of physical resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> Has the Minister asked her Department to provide an update on the urban and rural stations that were closed, how gardaí are managing those closures and how that impacts on the ground? There were many other stations, such as in Malahide and Howth, that were downgraded to part-time stations which close at 9 p.m. I would hope, as the economy improves, that the Government would prioritise the justice area, certainly, the policing area. However, what we find on the ground, regardless of what figures are produced, is that burglaries and petty crime are up, and people in areas that have had their stations either downgraded or closed know that such is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> If one telephones Malahide Garda station after 9 p.m., the call is transferred to Coolock where gardaí who have to reroute it back to Malahide gardaí to respond, do not have the local knowledge. That is not the way we should be going about this. I would be particularly interested to find out what the Minister's plans are in that regard. Is she open to reviewing the closures with a view to reopening some of those stations? Is she open to putting back on a full-time footing those stations that have been downgraded to part time? What is really important, in the case of the stations that close at 9 p.m., is that the Government gives a firm commitment, which I asked of the Minister's predecessor, that these stations would not be closed and this is not the beginning of a process of closure of those stations. I asked the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, about this on a number of occasions when he came to the Seanad and I was never able to elicit a direct response in that regard. It would be important at least that the Government gives a firm commitment that the stations that are downgraded to part-time stations are not on the road to full closure.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> When one looks at instances in the Probation Service in matters such as outstanding bench warrants - there are over 10,000 out on probation - these are areas on which the Government must concentrate. People need confidence in their police force, but the police force needs to have confidence in the Government in so far as gardaí will be given the tools to do their job. As the Minister and every Member of this House will be aware, the issue of morale in the Garda is a serious one. Morale is still very low in the Garda. Over successive Governments, gardaí have suffered quite excessive cuts to their pay and overtime, and then there is the resourcing issue. As I mentioned earlier, some stations cannot send a car to respond because there are not enough gardaí in the station and there are not enough gardaí in the unit. I am particularly interested to hear the Minister's views on those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I welcome some of the changes being proposed with regard to the joint policing committees but these committees will not solve our policing issue. If we put more effort and emphasis into fully resourcing gardaí and giving them the tools to do their job, we would be in a much better position.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">I speak in favour of the motion. It is a good motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I speak as somebody who was a member of the joint policing committee for Gorey when Gorey was a policing district and I want to raise the matter of the mergers that happened on the previous Minister's watch. The attempt to reduce and downsize, of which I have practical experience in my area, is counterproductive on the basis that when merging areas we opted for what was easiest and handiest, but it also turned out to be biggest. The policing district of Enniscorthy, which is a policing district of Gorey and Enniscorthy, has a population of 85,000 people. It is almost as big as County Kilkenny and bigger than many counties throughout the State. It is not working. I am glad to put on the record that it is too big, with a number of major towns and one superintendent. When one makes comparisons with other Garda districts, it seems to be okay for whatever reason that there are Garda districts with 25% of the population of this particular district. I have always questioned the logic of this merger between Gorey Garda district and Enniscorthy Garda district.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I also want to put on the record that the spike in crime in this area is no accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I am not being critical of any individual member of the force. However, it is no accident that we do not have a superintendent - a senior member of the police force - sitting in a district that used to be in place. On the other side of the border between counties Wicklow and Wexford, the Arklow Garda district was merged with the Wicklow Garda district. Now we have two Garda districts with a population of approximately 140,000. That is about the size of County Limerick. It is not good enough. I fought this fight as hard as I could. I wrote to the previous Commissioner to look for meetings. To my disappointment, I got no hearing and the senior gardaí who made the decision and chose to ignore any common sense approach towards this ill-judged decision. </p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The Minister is in this role a few months. She has a capacity to take on board what is being said in a fair and open-minded manner. I hope she considers this matter. It is important. This area is too big. I believe it is the biggest physical Garda district in the State. I am also told that it has the largest population of a rural Garda district in the State. The only other areas that are similar in size are in the Dublin metropolitan area. It is a mistake and it needs to be reviewed. I am not somebody who wants to tear the house down on any particular issue. This was a huge mistake from the outset. While the Garda districts are now merged and it is probably difficult to disentangle that merger, thankfully some semblance of common sense prevailed with the civilian staff. They remained in the Gorey Garda station. The inspector was also retained. The personnel lost was the superintendent. The solution - it is an easy solution if the willingness is there - is to reinstate a superintendent in Gorey Garda station and to have another in the Enniscorthy Garda station. There are examples of multiple superintendents in Garda districts although they may be in different areas or sectors, whether it is traffic or another. The example is there. I ask the Minister to consider it. </p>

          <p eId="para_557">I am glad for the opportunity to say a few words on the motion and amendments before us. They all head in the same direction and I think the House is generally at one on its views on the joint policing committees, JPCs. Having listened to the contribution of Senator D'Arcy with interest, I am aware that we will be allowed meander slightly beyond the particular subject before us. One item concerning policing in its broadest sense, on which I would like to have a fuller debate at some stage in the future, is the question of the Garda Reserve. The Garda Reserve seemed to be an excellent idea. It still is an excellent idea but we need clarification on where it is going, what are the Department's plans for it and how it is integrating into the broader policing of our towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Whether it is hearsay, speculation, fact or fiction, there appears to be an indication of a difficulty at times and in places between the regular force and members of the Garda Reserve. Some would seem to indicate there is a degree of resentment towards the concept of the Garda Reserve. All of us know many upstanding citizens in our local communities who would be interested in playing a role on behalf of society in the reserve. We may have to re-advertise and republicise the reserve if it is the view that it is a good thing. What is the Government's thinking on it? In all of our towns and villages it could be of significant assistance to security and co-operation between the citizen and the State and its the security forces. The forces of law and order could be aided by way of the Garda Reserve. When one thinks of traffic difficulties or very minor social behaviour problems such as vandalism in estates, the resource of the reserve - local community known to the community - could be quite effective. </p>
          <p eId="para_559"> One of the motions speaks to Garda numbers and that game of tennis can be played forever. Big Garda numbers means better law and order; smaller Garda numbers means worse. It is not as simple as that. It is about the quality of our policing and the way it integrates with the community. Focusing on community would bring us back to the concept of utilising the Garda Reserve to greater effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I apologise to the Minister - I must attend another committee hearing - for not being in a position to hear her response but I would be grateful if she would, at her convenience, let me know her thinking on the Garda Reserve. Perhaps my concerns are unnecessary. However, I hear rumours from time to time about the difficulty and perhaps a lack of complete co-operation between the reserve and the official force. It is something we should work on and resolve. We would all benefit from progress in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I thank the Cathaoirleach. I am happy with the motion and the amendments. I hope the House will not be having a silly divide on this issue.</p>

Senators will be interested to hear the outcome of the review we did. A point made in the review is that we do not have national consistency in the approach. While we always want to allow for some local variation, that is one of the points that emerged. It does give us an opportunity to discuss these important local structures. I believe they are important as do most of the Senators who have spoken. I am glad to support the motion as it has been laid out. </p>
          <p eId="para_566"> It might be helpful if I went through what has been happening recently in regard to JPCs and the recommendations from the review. As stated by Senator Conway, the JPCs arise from the Garda Síochána Act 2005. One of the points in the motion is that it lays a lot of emphasis on collaboration and co-operation. That is very much what we are trying to promote as standard practice in the JPCs. That is necessary if they are to be successful. We carried out a review in 2012 and published new guidelines in August of this year on how the JPCs should operate. I hope that as they get up and running now, following the local elections, these guidelines will be helpful. This came from a programme for Government commitment which we had made that we would review community partnerships and collaborative engagement between JPCs and the community. We do have to use these local structures to best effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_567"> In terms of the review, it was conducted with the Department of the Environment, community and Local Government. There was a questionnaire, a call for consultation and 60 submissions received. Significant work has been done in ascertaining the experience of people who were on JPCs and what the local communities believe about them. We did find - as found in the House today - that there was considerable support for JPCs but it is also fair to say the review indicated they were operating unevenly and were more effective in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> We want to address that in a pragmatic way. We do not want to inhibit local initiative. That is an important consideration. One of the strongest themes was the need to emphasise a considered and collaborative approach. The cross-cutting nature of JPCs was recognised - the motion recognises it also - and how they can benefit the sort of collaboration in the interests of what we all want to see, which is the safety and security of the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There is a need for JPCs to set out strategic plans. They must also be linked to the objectives of the Garda annual policing plan. That is a good idea, relevant for the area but also relevant to local authority plans. At present, local authorities and the newly-established local and community development committees are in the process of developing six-year local economic and community plans. The JPCs are also going to be required to have those six-year strategic plans, which I think is a good idea, but they do need to be looked at by way of an annual report. Senator Ó Clochartaigh has suggested some amendments, but I think the new guidelines actually meet quite a lot of the recommendations that were made in the amendment to the motion. The guidelines require a strategic plan and collaboration. There will be an annual report, and people can be invited into the JPCs either as observers or as guests. The Senator asked why public representatives cannot be represented on both JPCs in his area. I think this would be impractical in terms of numbers. In my own area, people took turns to be on the joint policing committees in order not to have huge numbers attending at any one time. There is nothing to stop any Oireachtas Member from attending, and I think that most JPCs do allow contributions, as the Senator has stated. </p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The guidelines now stipulate that the annual report must outline what actions the JPCs have taken in a given year to meet what they have laid out in the strategic plan. This is about monitoring and evaluation and making sure that they are more effective. It is good to lay out a six-year action plan, but it is also necessary to report annually on what has actually been achieved in terms of the priorities that were set out. </p>
          <p eId="para_571"> The JPCs are a mechanism to allow people to have more engagement with the Garda Síochána. In the guidelines we have allowed for an increased number of community representatives. We have also emphasised the importance of diversity so that the different community groups, business representatives, immigrant communities and Travellers are represented at the JPCs. It is important that they respect diversity and make sure that there is the kind of representation that will reach out to groups that are sometimes quite marginalised and whose members may feel quite separate and less included in local policing plans. I would have to say, however, that gardaí are doing a lot of work on integration and involving migrant communities in their work. They have set up a specific office to do that. </p>
          <p eId="para_572"> In looking at the guidelines, I felt it was important that there be a fair degree of flexibility suited to local circumstances. We have emphasised in the guidelines that we do not want to over formalise these committees, but we do want to ensure that there is a certain standard that is met throughout the country in terms of how the JPCs go about their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> We have focused on the importance of community policing, and there are lots of different ways in which that can be done. We have a very good tradition of community policing in this country but it can be enhanced. The small areas policing pilot project was discussed in the Seanad. That is important, as we are seeing in the Dublin metropolitan region and the north inner city in particular. The first part of the Fianna Fáil amendment calls for a dedicated public order unit in Dublin city centre. I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner already about policing in the city centre. The small areas policing pilot project, which has been developed in the north inner city, is giving a particular focus to that kind of community activity. This is needed so that all of the different players meet together. There is, of course, also the forum, where representatives of the police, the business community and Dublin City Council are meeting to work out the best possible approaches to tackling some of the issues which we see in inner cities. We are evaluating the outcome of that pilot project. </p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The Garda has a very proactive approach to developing partnerships with local communities. This has been very successful in the United States and in the UK and I would like see this being developed further in this country. We do of course have the community alert scheme, which is the partnership between the Garda Síochána, Muintir na Tíre and local communities. It is remarkable to consider that there are 1,300 local groups throughout the country, and we have 2,500 neighbourhood watch programmes. Since the Garda set up the new text alert scheme, 450 text alert groups have been set up around the country involving 80,000 people. I would like to take up the point that Senator Bradford made in relation to this, namely, that having safe communities is about a lot of different elements working together. It is about the Garda, but it is also about how the community responds. Communities are working to develop greater safety, alerting gardaí to what is happening and working with residents' associations and neighbourhood watch groups. Every Senator here knows how important the local neighbourhood watch programmes are. I see great potential for this text alert scheme to develop further.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> One of the things I would like to see as a result of yesterday's budget is gardaí having access to better technology. They should have the resources and the proper fleet to be available in communities. They should also have the most advanced mobile phone technology in order to have very quick contact back and forth to base and with their colleagues. </p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I believe that some of the announcements that we made yesterday addressed the issues in the Fianna Fáil amendment in particular. It is very important that we have seen an increase for the Department of Justice and Equality in the budget for the first time year on year since 2008. That is the reality of the situation that gardaí were facing. Despite the needs that had been outlined, we have seen that the Department's budget was not increased between 2008 and 2011. We are seeing it being increased right now by €141 million. We are seeing a 68% increase in capital funding, 300 recruits going into Templemore with another 100 on 1 December and another 100 on 1 January. We are seeing a commitment to monitor the precise force that will be needed throughout the year as we see what the scale of retirements is. We are freeing up 75 gardaí for front-line duties as a result of the civilianisation initiative in Dublin Airport and a further 75 as a result of the changes to Border management and visa issues throughout the country. We are effectively ensuring that over the coming year we will have 450 front-line gardaí made available through new recruits and through the civilianisation programme which we are undertaking. That is very significant by any judgment, particularly in terms of the recent history in relation to the budget in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> However, I am in no way complacent. We owe it to our citizens to ensure their absolute safety and that is why I am pleased we are able to provide 400 new cars as well. As a Government over the last years, in contrast to previous years, we have ensured that there is a very significant budget for the replacement of Garda vehicles. A number of Senators have asked about this. It is the ongoing replacement of an older fleet. We would like to get to a point where a reasonable percentage of the fleet would be replaced every year and that the budget would be there and available for that. As I have said, we made a very good start yesterday with the €11 million that was announced. That will obviously need to be ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> To address some of the issues in the amendment, the Department did not suffer from a reduction in resources. The only change was the one I outlined to Senator Ó Clochartaigh earlier, which is that the Vote for the new equality commission became an independent Vote of €6 million. Other than that, we saw the budget either increasing or being maintained in all of the Department's other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">We saw an increase of €44 million for the Garda pay budget, which will ensure we have resources for the numbers referenced, namely, 13,000 gardaí and 1,980 civilians, in the budget allocation for the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of the expenditure report. Clearly, it is important that we also examine reform. The reform initiatives, which include the establishment of the new police authority and the recruitment, through open competition, of the new Garda Commissioner, are very important. The Garda is constantly examining how it needs to reform its operations, whether that be, as pointed out by some Senators, related to the precise numbers that should be allocated to particular geographical areas, which needs continual monitoring in terms of population change, the demands in an area, whether it be urban or rural, and the varying policing demands made in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The density of Garda stations in this country is still higher than in other countries, but I have no intention to close any further Garda stations. It is important we continually evaluate how the service is being provided and that we demand the highest standards. The Garda Inspectorate reports on a range of issues in an ongoing way. We saw the report recently from it on the penalty points situation. The work of the Garda Inspectorate is very important in ensuring we have the right standards available and that they are continually monitored in terms of delivering an effective policing service.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I thank Senators for their contributions. I took note of the varying points they have made and I will respond individually to some Senators.</p>

        <speech by="#RonanMullen" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_582">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. As has been rightly said, the joint policing committees perform very important functions. I am mindful of every small town in the United States which has its town hall and local governance, but Ireland could be said to be one of the most centralised states in the western world. I am not sure if this is a symptom of the distrust official Ireland sometimes has for its people or whether it is simply a lack of imagination regarding what could be achieved with real reform of local government. We had the local government reform legislation recently. The effect on joint policing in recent times has been the reduction in the number of these important committees. The Minister introduced the revised joint policing committee guidelines in August, and under those guidelines we will have committees operating at city and county level following the abolition of town councils. There will be just over 30 joint policing committees, which will be approximately a quarter of the number we have had. That reduction will sever an important connection that has existed between local communities and those who keep them secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> In its submission on the new guidelines, the Association of Criminal Justice Research and Development raised some interesting points regarding international best practice. It pointed out that in the UK, under section 97 of the Police Reform Act 2002, the British equivalent of joint policing committees includes a wider range of actors, including police authorities, fire and rescue services and primary care trusts. The UK uses the model of community and police consultative groups. The historical context for those groups was the Brixton riots of 1981. Since 2005, membership has been extended to include the local fire brigade chief, local courts and local prosecutors. In some areas they have been renamed as public safety boards to move the group away from the original focus on policing to a wider context of safety within communities. Would that be a welcome development that could be instructive and useful for the Irish model? I urge the Minister to consider widening the remit of the joint policing committee model to embrace this wider public safety role. The way forward is not to reduce the number of policing committees because that severs important links of trust between those tasked with public safety and the communities they guard. For the sake of local democracy and participation by people in important local issues, we should not be moving in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I want to raise and flag with the Minister an issue which I might table as a matter on the Adjournment at some stage. We recently heard in the Oireachtas from the Irish Tourist Assistance Service, which is doing great work, and many volunteers have contributed to assisting tourists. Approximately 13,000 tourists have been victims of crime in this country during the past 20 years. The ITAS does great work helping people out formally and informally in providing them with basic needs in emergency situations. Tourists are often particularly vulnerable in that they may not speak the language and may be isolated or on their own. One of the issues that came up in our discussion with the ITAS was the 2012 EU directive which establishes minimum standards on the rights and protection of victims of crime. We are required to implement that directive by November 2015. It is legally binding. It will ensure victims of crime will have the same rights to support and protection regardless of where in the EU the crime is committed. I understand that one of the rights in question is the right of the victim to receive information throughout the criminal justice process. The onus will be on the State to ensure the victim is kept informed about developments in their case. Many victims, especially tourists although not only them, find it difficult to receive information about their case. When a tourist returns to their home country, contacting the Garda station for information can be very costly and time consuming only to discover that the garda is not on duty. There is currently no way to contact the garda or Garda station via e-mail.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Britain has introduced the Track My Crime service, which allows victims of crime to access the progress of the investigation of their crime as well as contact the officer leading the investigation. Would such a service be useful for all victims of crime in this country, particularly in cross-Border cases? This service has been adopted by the UK police districts of Kent, Somerset, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. It is a service accessed by the public by logging into a website available at <i>trackmycrime.police.uk</i>. Victims of crime are given a reference number which can be used to log in to a secure website to get information on the status of the criminal investigation concerning them. I know there is information that could not be given to victims in such cases, but what about the information that can be given? Victims of crime often feel left out in the cold when it comes to the police investigation of their cases. They have legitimate questions such as whether someone has been arrested for vandalising their car, or whether the Garda has arrested the people breaking into houses in their area. Victims can become frustrated when they find it difficult to contact an investigating garda who may be off duty or on patrol, but a dedicated website could act as a one-stop-shop information source, which could be a great tool for victims and is something that could be easily updated by the investigating garda. There is widespread public support in the UK for information being made available on the investigation of crimes. An online service could satisfy the needs of victims of crime, be they whether a suspect has been detained, charges have been filed or a court date has been set. We have introduced innovative schemes in the criminal justice area, not least the Criminal Assets Bureau, It would be beneficial were we to think outside the box again. Would this not also be required on foot of the directive? I know the Minister does not have an opportunity to respond again but it is something I would like to take up with her at a later point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinConway" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_586">I was at the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when the group dealing with tourists who have become victims made a presentation, and I was very struck by it. I would point out to the previous Senator that there is a good deal happening in terms of the European victims directive. I am advised by the Minister that legislation on this area will be introduced in the new year. The TrackMyCrime service is a fantastic way of giving those who have been the victims of crime some feedback. People want to have communication in that they want to know what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">As a result of yesterday's budget, I hope we will see some investment in ICT in terms of the Garda and within Garda stations. In this day and age it is ridiculous that one cannot e-mail a Garda station. As the Minister is cognisant of those issues I think there will be significant improvements in feedback and implementation of the European victims directive and we will see legislation in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> In regard to the motion, I thought it was a very useful debate. We have got great testimonials from many Members serving on JPCs. Practically every Member in this House has served on a JPC. While there is much wrong with them, a significant amount is right. We now have a formalised structure for engagement where local public representatives with Oireachtas Members and community activists can engage. It would be worthwhile for every Member to read the new JPC guidelines, as much of what has been discussed here today is contained in the new guidelines issued by the Department. I acknowledge that there appears to be a delay in setting up JPCs following the local elections. However, that is not unusual for JPCs. Many of the new structures introduced as a result of the recent local government changes and which manifested themselves in the election aftermath are taking time to put in place. In terms of the regional authorities, the new structures will not be fully in place until the new year. When the structure is in place I hope the JPCs will operate more effectively than in the past. </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Senators Thomas Byrne and Michael D'Arcy were concerned that the JPCs were too large. It is provided for in the guidelines that subcommittees can be set up on a municipal district level or a dual municipal district level if that is deemed necessary by the members of the overarching committee. There are means within the guidelines for dealing with a county with a significantly wide geographic area, a mixture of urban and rural. The debate on Garda numbers and Garda cars is one for a different forum. What we have had here was a discussion on the future of JPCs and how they can be more efficient, effective and more representative. Garda resources and all those issues can be dealt with in other ways. It is important to remain focused. JPCs have worked well and can work much better and, as such, I hope that whatever votes we may have, hopefully none, will be focused on the workings of JPCs. </p>
          <p eId="para_590"> I thank the significant number of Senators who contributed to the debate. It was a useful debate and it is an issue we should come back to in terms of the operation of the new JPCs. We should always be prepared to review and improve.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I welcome the Minister. I know he is directly involved with the issue I am raising and we have discussed it in the past. Will he clarify the import of the minutes of a meeting between him, the Taoiseach and a company called Marine Harvest about the Galway Bay sea farm project and licence? Will he clarify the ramifications of those minutes for the licensing process?</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> These minutes were brought to my attention. I did not seek them. They were the front page story of <i>The Galway Advertiser</i> last week. The Minister has always been very clear that in deciding who would eventually get the licence for the sea farm project, if it was to go ahead, based on having all the evidence, there would be an arm’s length distance between him and any company involved. I have evidence that a meeting took place between the Taoiseach, the Minister and the then Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, Deputy Joe McHugh and four members of the company, Marine Harvest.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, says there are 21 expressions of interest in this licence. Why were not all the other companies, apart from Marine Harvest, invited to this meeting? It seems this meeting may have breached the rules regarding tendering regulations for salmon farm licences. I am asking questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">I am asking questions. My Adjournment matter is to ask the Minister to clarify this. I am making statements but I am open to hearing an answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> Why did this meeting take place while the Minister is still making up his mind? Why were the other 21 companies not invited?</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> There is a serious issue about Deputy McHugh’s role. He lobbied heavily for Marine Harvest on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I have several quotations from him. We now know that as Minister of State he has responsibility for Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and Údarás na Gaeltachta which funds fisheries in that area. Serious questions are being asked about that. According to the minutes, Marine Harvest says it needs a champion to drive forward the interests of the industry. The question I have been asked to put to the Minister is whether this champion is Deputy McHugh. He has lobbied for Marine Harvest for several years and according to himself was the person who facilitated this meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister. He is now in charge of IFI, and Údarás na Gaeltachta, which has invested €1.3 million in the south Connemara salmon farms. Was the Minister of State given this responsibility to keep IFI in check because it opposes the fish farm proposals, to drive forward the industry and co-ordinate interactions with the EU Commission? </p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The signs in favour of the sea farm are no longer as clear cut as they were. I am on record as having supported this farm at the outset from the point of view of growth in the industry and of jobs, but it has been unravelling. The Minister says structural changes are taking place in the Irish Marine Institute to advance the science. Will the Minister clarify what that means? The size and bulk of the farm is also an issue because of the threat to the environment and the local fishing and angling industry. I am more concerned about what seems to be a cosy relationship. Since this was brought to my attention, it is important to have the truth on the record. This freedom of information revelation must rule Marine Harvest out of the running for this licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to this matter. The premise behind the Senator’s question is incorrect. The meeting to which she refers was not about the Galway Bay farm.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> On 30 January, I met with representatives of the company referred to by the Senator. The meeting was chaired by An Taoiseach. Officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department were also in attendance. The meeting was held at the request of the company to discuss licensing and industry development issues associated with the company's operations in Ireland. It is a very big employer here and happens to be the largest salmon farming company in the world. It is a huge multinational so there was nothing inappropriate about meeting it, just as I meet other multinationals seeking to invest in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> As is appropriate, it was explained from the outset that specific applications which the company submitted to my Department for consideration could not be discussed in detail in view of the statutory basis of the assessment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> Bord lascaigh Mhara, BIM, and not Marine Harvest Ireland is the applicant in the case to which the Senator refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> It is entirely appropriate for me as Minister to meet Marine Harvest Ireland on matters relevant to the company's operations in Ireland having regard to the important role it plays as a food producer from the marine resource. There is always a strict separation between my ministerial role as decision maker in respect of aquaculture licence applications and my ministerial duty to promote the sustainable development of the industry. This separation of duties is always strictly observed, including at meetings with industry representatives, as it is at meetings with NGOs, which have a contrary view at times.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> The report of the meeting was put in the public domain on foot of a freedom of information request by a member of the public. The report is clear in setting out the limited parameters of the discussion and I draw the Senator's attention in particular to the specific statement at the outset of the meeting that individual licensing applications could not be discussed in detail because of the statutory basis of the licensing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> The company in question plays an important role in the provision of employment in the aquaculture industry in disadvantaged coastal regions. It would be quite incredible if I refused to meet its representatives to discuss general issues associated with their activities in Ireland. Indeed, it would be negligent of me to remain aloof from key employers on the basis of a supposed conflict of interest which does not exist and in respect of which the strictest of protocols are observed by me as Minister and by my officials. If anybody reads the report of the meeting, it will be clear this separation of functions has been applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> With regard to the Galway Bay deep sea project, an application by BIM for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012. The application and its accompanying environmental impact assessment are being considered under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Foreshore Act 1933.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> A determination in respect of the application will be made as soon as possible following completion of the necessary assessment process. This assessment process will take full account of all national and EU legislative requirements and will reflect the full engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects of the application. The fullest consideration is being given to all submissions received as part of the statutory and public consultation stages of the process. As the application is under active consideration as part of the statutory process, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time, apart from saying what I have said many times publicly. I will not grant a licence to any aquaculture or finfish farm application unless and until I am fully satisfied on the basis of scientific evidence from the Marine Institute that it is appropriate to do so. It is important to put on the record that I have not granted a licence in my three years as Minister for salmon farming to Marine Harvest Ireland or anybody else. I act on the basis of the advice I get from marine biologists and marine scientists and I take issue with the insinuation of what the Senator said because it suggests that both the Taoiseach and I are involved in an inappropriate relationship with the company, which simply is not the case. The company employs many people in Ireland. Its chief executive officer was in Ireland and he wanted to get an understanding of the systems here and the ambition within government for the sector. That is what we discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> There is no mystery. A meeting was held with a major employer, at its request, to discuss a broad range of issues. It was a perfectly appropriate meeting at which clear parameters were set down on the State's side in respect of "live" applications. That was done by the Taoiseach at the beginning of the meeting. The meeting was the subject of a standard report, which in due course was put in the public domain on foot of a freedom of information request. The minutes of the meeting have no import beyond what is clearly stated in the relevant minutes. The only mention I made at that meeting of any application related to Shot Head was when I was asked a question on when there was likely to be a decision on it, which has been under consideration for at least two and a half years. I said, because of information I had received from my Department, that we were hoping to make a decision by Easter, which was a few months after that meeting. I had absolutely no indication as to what that decision would be or the parameters of the decision or the considerations I needed to make on the back of that application. I did not have recommendations on my desk and, therefore, I could not do that. All I did was update them on a likely timeframe and, as it happens, there has been no decision on Shot Head just in case anybody thinks the meeting resulted in an early decision on that application.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Minister for the clarification and that is why it is important that this debate is taking place. The purpose of the debate is to clarify the import of the minutes and their ramifications. I accept the distinction the Minister made. However, it is clear when reading the minutes that Marine Harvest Ireland was trying to rush the licensing process not just for this application, but for all applications, as the Minister said. It finds the process tedious and it spoke about "the need for a predictable licensing system which would facilitate investment". I accept Marine Harvest Ireland is a large employer but it is important to put this information in the public domain because doubt is being raised about the bona fides of this project and the licensing arrangements on an ongoing basis. I thank the Minister again for the clarification and I will watch this closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">Marine Harvest Ireland has nothing to do with this application. Like many other companies, it is watching the process because this is a new departure. This relates to offshore deep sea salmon farming and it is the first time we have received an application of this scale off the Irish coast. Everyone interested in salmon farming is watching what happens with the application, including many NGOs, which is why we are being so careful with it to make sure the process is appropriate and is followed. If that results in a rejection, scaling down or granting of the application, so be it. I will take responsibility for that on the basis of all the scientific advice and the stakeholders' input which has gone into the lengthy process</p>

            <p eId="para_670">This started in 2012 and, therefore, nobody can accuse me of rushing anything in this space. I sometimes make the distinction between aquaculture and finfish farming because I see aquaculture as shellfish. People are looking for certainty regarding a likely timeline relating to when they apply for something and when they get a decision and we are trying to put systems in place that can give certainty, whether it is a positive or negative decision. We need to be able to make decisions with proper scientific advice in a reasonable timeframe and we are trying to put systems in place that can do that. I assure the Senator we will not make irresponsible decisions or decisions on the basis of lobbying by any company, regardless of its size or scale. We will make decisions on the basis of the advice I get from experts in the Marine Institute and others who have an input into the licensing process and who deserve to be fully heard as well. That will be the only criterion for making decisions.</p>

            <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_671">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The matter I raise is a follow-up to a presentation to the Joint Committee on Health last week. The GAA made a submission calling for the establishment of a task force on concussion injury comprising representatives of sports organisations, sports medicine bodies and primary and post-primary schools. The main focus of the task force should be to review successful public health campaigns in countries such as Canada and the United States in relation to concussion injury; plan and implement a national awareness campaign; run a targeted awareness campaign in primary and post-primary schools for pupils, parents and teachers; and develop educational resources such as online training courses, educational videos and information leaflets.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">The deficiencies in care were highlighted in a submission by Professor John M. Ryan to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_673">Despite the increased publicity around the problem that concussion in sport presents and despite the increasing awareness around concussion, there remain deficiencies in Ireland in knowledge translation around the management of concussion particularly at local level. There is evidence that some athletes hide their symptoms deliberately or through ignorance to try and prevent being withdrawn from sporting activity. At a primary care level there are frequently reported deficiencies in knowledge around the identification and management of sports-related concussion. Similarly, at a secondary care level most sports-related concussions in Ireland are managed initially by senior house officers in emergency medicine. These doctors' experience in head injury management revolves around the management of traumatic brain injuries at the higher level, including skull fractures and traumatic brain haemorrhages. The approach to the concussed athlete frequently follows the approach of dealing with the worst case scenario. Such an approach is built upon undergraduate medical education where exposure to sports and exercise medicine is limited. </p>
            <p eId="para_674">It is in this context that I draw attention to the proposal made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that a task force be established which would examine this area and put in place a proper structure so that every organisation is singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of dealing with and managing concussion.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2014-10-15T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_675">I thank Senator Burke for raising this very important topic. He refers to the need for the Minister for Health to establish a task force with representatives from sports organisations, sports medicine bodies and primary and post primary schools in order to devise an appropriate education programme to improve awareness of sport-related concussion, its management and possible consequences among players, parents, coaches and medics. I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> The issue of concussion wherever it occurs needs to be taken very seriously as it is a mild traumatic brain injury. It is important to also state that it is not just during sport that the dangers of concussion arise. While we have seen some very public examples of concussion at major sporting events recently, I do not think it would be helpful to focus just on sporting occasions. There is always a risk of injury, however small, in all aspects of normal day-to-day activities whether in school, while commuting, at home or in the workplace which can result in concussion. The management of concussion includes evaluation, removal from active participation, medical assessment of symptoms, physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve followed by a gradual return to participation. This is the case wherever it occurs, not just in sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> I would like to acknowledge the work of a number of sporting organisations which have been very proactive in raising awareness of the dangers of concussion and in developing guidance on concussion for participants, coaches, officials and others. However, in saying that, I also call on the sporting organisations to ensure that they are visibly implementing their own guidelines and doing whatever they can to ensure the health and safety of all of those participating in sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> Regular physical activity is one of the most important things anybody can do for his or her health. While the benefits are well known, we must also ensure that we do not discourage anybody from participating in sport and physical activity, either directly or as a volunteer, because of fears about sustaining injury or concerns about how to respond when in a position of authority or responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> As the Senator is aware from his participation in the recent Joint Committee on Health and Children hearings on the implications of concussion in sport, officials in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills recently started exploring the issue of concussion in school settings. The two Departments brought together a small group of relevant experts from key organisations to have an exploratory discussion about the implications of concussion and to identify current shortcomings in concussion awareness and responses. This is an opportunity to build on work already undertaken to develop a uniform approach to understanding and educating people about concussion and creating a better awareness about injury prevention, risk reduction as well as response and treatment for concussion. While this is a complex issue, initially officials in both Departments will continue to work together and with the group of experts from key organisations referred to earlier to progress the development and distribution of information materials to reiterate that the management of concussion includes evaluation, removal from active participation, medical assessment of symptoms, physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve, followed by a gradual return to participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> I believe that a singular process with the backing of all relevant stakeholders will be beneficial in encouraging everyone to understand the true importance and implications of concussion. In the deliberations on concussion, the need to explore further what more needs to be done to ensure that concussion is dealt with in a safe manner was recognised. This work will continue in partnership with the key stakeholders from the sporting organisations and the medical professions.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. I accept that Departments are working together on this matter but in fairness to those who made submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, they pointed out that this is not just an issue for schools but also for all of the sporting organisations. We must make sure that there is one set of rules across the board for all sports settings and all sports, including GAA, rugby, soccer and so forth. That is why the witnesses suggested the setting up of a task force to include the people in the Department who are already working on this issue, as well as the other relevant stakeholders. It is about getting everybody on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> The representatives of Irish rugby who attended the hearings pointed out that there are world-wide regulations in rugby for dealing with concussion. There is a need for all sporting organisations to work together with the relevant Departments which is why a task force is a good idea. I am not saying that such a task force should meet every week for 12 months. I am simply saying that it is important for everybody to work together to provide the relevant information and to ensure that everyone is applying the same set of rules as regards players being removed from the field of play, when they can resume playing and how this is effected. That is very important.</p>
