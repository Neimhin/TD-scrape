          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Tairgim: "Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois."</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I thank everybody for being present for the Second Reading of the Bill. It is by providence that we are here today. We have to thank the peoples of Germany and eastern Europe, in particular, who have gained their independence from the Soviet Union in recent times. I also thank the peoples of Armenia, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Span and Sweden who have inserted into their constitutions the principles and safeguards proposed in the Bill. It is providence because this Private Members' Bill was tabled for its First Reading on 18 February 2014 and under the rules, if the Government does not object, it can proceed to Second Stage but only if comes out of the lottery drum. I thank providence that the Bill is having its Second Reading. I am nothing more than the courier of what is an excellent set of principles and an excellent safeguard in the constitutions of the countries I have named. It is through the trauma of history that they came to be inserted. There has been a terrible trail of destruction, loss of life and mutilation in these countries as a result of not having such a constitutional provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> The wording is taken verbatim from an official translation of Article 38.1 of the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany. It states "The Members of Parliament [in their case, the Bundestag; in our case, each House of the Oireachtas] shall be representatives of the whole people not bound by orders or institutions and responsible only to their conscience". Edmund Burke talked about this principle. The conscience is that of a responsible, thinking human being who has the honour, privilege, responsibility and solemn mandate in parliament to represent the whole people and to be bound as a legate. It is to prevent people from doing anything other than what they have been instructed to do. This rigidity is dangerous; it is what happened when infiltration of democracy occurred in Germany in the 1930s, as the German people are well aware. I lived and worked for 15 months in Lithuania and the former Soviet republics, now the new democracies of eastern Europe, are protected and safeguarded - a word I like - by this principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> Of what is there to be afraid when the Government talks about political reform? It is a good objective, but the evidence shows that there is nothing happening in that regard. What has happened runs contrary to the principle entailed by this constitutional provision. The red lights are flashing and the alarm bells are ringing. We are in Parliament to serve the people, nothing more, nothing less, and to hold the Government to account, but in my experience that has not happened in my experience, which is a shame. That is why when we engage in a reality check, we visit hospitals to see the queues and people waiting on trolleys. Yesterday schools were closed. In addition, the banks are bust and not working. We were told by the Governor of the Central Bank that €40 billion in losses was put on the people; that is the sum after the fog has cleared. That is wrong. It is a lie and an illusion. The amount is €100 billion, of which €40 billion is official national debt with harps around it that is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, while €60 billion comprises the debt mountain that private households, families and business are still carrying, which equates to negative equity, pain, sickness, broken families and under equipped schools. That is the reality which no statistics can deny. That is why people are objecting on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Let us look at how we can safeguard our parliamentary opportunity to hold the Government to account as provided for in the Bill. I thank Members who are supportive of the Bill, some of whom are members of parties, which is good. The proposal to include a safeguard provision in the Constitution would do nothing to change the arrangements or otherwise of parties. Let nobody try to fool people into believing it would because it would not. I invite Members to read the wording of the proposal and to do so umpteen times. It is plain and simple and does not need any interpretation or calibration. It is as simple as, "You shall not kill," in that one does not have to ask a lawyer how to define the word "kill". Do not insult the people. </p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Why is it that in recent polls people have said they do not trust parties? The reason is - this has not been articulated - parties are too dominant and rigid. They do not allow for the organic breathing of liberty and democracy, which is wrong. The reason people are saying they propose to vote for Independents is they do not trust parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> I am delighted to say Fianna Fáil is supportive of the proposal, which is good. I know from speaking to individual Members, including some members of the Government parties, that, personally, they support the proposal. Why is that? It is because it is logically unassailable. Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh will be aware that I explained to his leader how it is unassailable. It is very simple. Rather than attribute the following to any party, let us take the example of a new party with 200,000 members from all over the country. It holds an Ard Fheis in Dublin where there are many venues which are large enough to cater for 200,000 people, at which are discussed its proposed policies on health, education and finance-taxation and its desire to be fair to the people in terms of the distribution of the resources available. Following a three-day debate it arrives at a set of principled policies which it will support and which are supported unanimously. This is possible. It also supports a candidate to stand in the general election. We will name that candidate Mr. Keogh who is unanimously approved as a candidate.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The candidate's name is Mr. Keogh. In the general election he secures a seat in Parliament. He may be a member of the Government but for 12 months he represents the new party based on its unanimously agreed principles and policies and everything works fine. Ireland, with its 4.5 million people, is then visited by a pandemic that makes Ebola look simple. This is possible. The World Health Organization and all other governments nearby that are concerned that the global population could suffer come together and decide on the best form of management and principles to deal with the pandemic which are totally at odds with the policy unanimously decided by the new party. Mr. Keogh now has to use his conscience to do what is right as a representative of the whole people. Everything moves up a step because as parliamentarians we represent the whole people. Mr. Keogh must not be bound by the orders, instructions and mandates decided on unanimously 12 months previously so as not to endanger the people of Ireland. In this situation he will be able to rely on what is provided for by this proposal if is inserted into the Constitution. That is the reason Germany has included it in its basic law and it works. It also works in Lithuania. Ten days ago in Paris I spoke about this to Egidijus Vareikis of Seimas, the Lithuanian Parliament, and he agreed with me that this was needed in written constitutions. It is not needed in the United States where there are free votes on everything. It is also not needed in Britain because it does not have a written constitution. Unfortunately, we do need it here. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Let us look at the evidence of what has happened here in the past while. In my experience, our problems started with the recapitalisation of the banks under the troika programme. At the time more than €16 billion was taken from the National Pension Reserve Fund and put into the banks. This was done on the basis of an instruction from the Government parties that had the largest ever majority in the State. Was this good for the people? The answer is no. I sent a text message to the Taoiseach at the time asking that he pause and not proceed and suggesting there were other ways to recapitalise the banks, including by way of creditor capitalisation or through the European Union which should have recapitalised them by writing off ELA.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Let us move forward to February 2013 and the introduction of so-called emergency legislation to liquidate IBRC and, more sinisterly, turn flimsy promissory notes, IOUs, into solemn national debt of €30 billion. With 20 minutes notice we were asked to come pass emergency legislation. However, there was no emergency. How do I know this? I know it because this is the area in which I work. Just like a doctor who knows what an emergency is in health, I know from my work what an emergency is in this area. It was propaganda, which is not nice, as it is misleading and what everybody else calls "spin". I call it "propaganda" because that is what it is. I do not like say it, but it is dishonest. I love my country and my colleagues in this House, but I do not like the avoidance of the truth or a failure to recognise and measure situations properly and honestly, as we serve the people. I am deeply dissatisfied at the level of inequality in the country. This is only happening because the Government has a large majority and is failing to allow backbenchers to express their views. I know this because I was one of them at one time. I note that there are only two Government Members in the House, both of whom will recall that I said when I was a member of the parliamentary party that there should have been levies imposed on corporates that were making profits, while citizens' incomes were disappearing or being reduced. The unfairness of it is blatant. I also say this to the chief executives of the companies to which I speak, who are my peers in terms of age and business experience in the markets and finance sector. There is nothing to be afraid of. While individual Government Members have told me that they support this proposal, they are afraid to say so. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The aforementioned legislation was sinister and unnecessary and I did not vote on it. The Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, will recall that I was paired for that vote following constant badgering of the Taoiseach by text message because I was not going to be a party to that legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">The Government will oppose this Bill for a number of reasons including the confusion that such a wording would introduce into our Constitution, the impact it could have on the working of this Parliament and the fact that it would not be in line with the Government's Oireachtas reform policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Since taking office in March 2011, the Government has been more committed to reforming the Oireachtas than any of its predecessors. In less than four years in office we have introduced two packages of Dáil reform, restructured the Oireachtas committee system and created an Oireachtas inquiry system. We are committed to introducing more reform to our Parliament before the Government seeks re-election in 2016 and continuing the process of Oireachtas reform in our second term of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The Deputy believes that a constitutional provision, such as his, is required to protect the Oireachtas and its elected members from the influence of extreme and perhaps undemocratic outside forces. The Government believes that the Constitution, adopted by the Irish people in a time when extremist politics were on the march across mainland Europe, already addresses this concern clearly and in a robust fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Article 15.10 of the Constitution recognises the protection required to enable Members of the Oireachtas to carry out their duties while also allowing each House of the Oireachtas the freedom to make its own rules and standing orders. Article 15.10 of the Constitution states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_27">Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate, to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members, and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">This clearly provides the constitutional principle that Members of the Oireachtas enjoy freedom to debate in each House of the Oireachtas and the freedom not to be interfered with, molested or corrupted in the exercise of their parliamentary duties. Rather than adding to those freedoms, the amendment proposed in this Bill would dilute such freedom and leave them open to question.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Everyone, including Oireachtas Members, has constitutional rights of expression and association and they have a right to decide to run for election as part of a political party or as a non-party candidate and to work as such after being elected. The proposed constitutional amendment could impact upon these rights and the wider implications of this would be negative for our parliamentary system and the people of Ireland, who expect that their public representatives will provide a stable Government. No restriction should be placed, in this democracy, on any individual who, within the law, wishes to join a political party or movement, who wishes to campaign for a political cause and who wishes to stand before the voting public and seek election to public office as a member of a political party or as a non-party candidate. Once elected by the people, such individuals should not be denied their existing constitutional rights to expression and association, nor their right to work with other like-minded public representatives as part of a lawful party or group to achieve their policies and principles. To attempt to restrict such a process would be to undermine democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Under the current system, the fact that, once elected, a public representative can decide to leave the party if they are not in agreement with a party policy is evidence that representatives are already free to act in accordance with their conscience. By way of contrast, under many parliamentary systems, if a representative votes against his or her party and crosses the floor of the House, this forces an immediate by-election. Such anti-defection provisions exist in India and, in different ways, in Hungary and Portugal. Recently, in the UK, we have seen MPs who have left their party, resigned from the House of Commons and stood in the resulting by-election for their new party.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The wording proposed within this Bill includes a number of concepts that have the potential to lead to constitutional confusion. The Bill indicates that Deputies and Senators have the same representational role. That is not the case. It is clear that Deputies have a representational role in relation to their constituencies as well as a national role. The Constitution sets out, in Article 16 on Dáil Éireann and in Article 18 on Seanad Éireann, the system by which individuals become Members of each House. The role Deputies and Senators have as representatives is clear from these provisions and no effort should be made to limit or put artificial constraints upon that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> In addition the Bill's reference to "orders or instructions" could be read as outlawing, in advance, any coalition or structured arrangement whereby a Deputy agreed to support a Government. It could also encourage court applications about political questions, politicising our court system in a way that could undermine the existing separation of powers within the Constitution and damage Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary. A further point is that the phrase "responsible only" in the Bill could have unexpected consequences if a Deputy was known to take a position based on a mixture of motives.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The Bill is dependent on what is considered an individual's conscience and this is hardly specific enough to be a constitutional principle. For some individuals only social issues should be considered matters of conscience. For others, economic issues are matters of conscience.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">The Whip system has Irish roots. Charles Stewart Parnell took a disorganised group of Irish MPs in the House of Commons and turned them into the Irish Party under a pledge to sit, act and vote together. He perfected the concept of the parliamentary party and Parnell-style parliamentary parties now exist in parliaments around the world. Some commentators, usually those with little or no practical parliamentary experience, comment on the Whip system as a danger to democracy. I disagree. The Whip system is based on a voluntary decision of any individual to agree with like-minded individuals to put their policies before the people at election time and then vote together as a group once elected, so as to provide their country with a stable Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Whenever I have put my name forward before the people of Wexford I have done so as a Fine Gael candidate in support of Fine Gael policies. The people who have given me their vote and their mandate have done so in the full knowledge of the policies and political party I support and on the understanding that my party would negotiate a programme for Government on the basis of those policies.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">That is my mandate. The same is true of the Members of this House who stood under the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, People Before Profit Alliance or Socialist Party banners. The voluntary nature of the Whip system has been seen repeatedly in this Chamber since 1922. Deputies who have put their names before the public as representatives of a political party have chosen to vote against their own party's position on a number of issues. This shows that every elected Oireachtas Member is free to vote whichever way he or she wants. To be bound by the Whip is a matter of choice. While the voters always have the opportunity to support non-party candidates instead of candidates from political parties, the vast majority choose not to. Perhaps they feel that non-party candidates do not provide the basis for stable Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Any process of reform of the Whip system must not lose the benefits of our Whip system. Those commentators who claim that a Parliament free of a Whip system would be a utopia ignore the realities that in democracies with very weak Whip systems all too often the loudest and best organised lobby groups hold sway and wealthy interests who can fund their own election campaigns have an advantage. I do not accept that this Bill is the way forward. A constitutional amendment is not in line with the Government's programme commitments on Oireachtas reform and neither has it been endorsed by the Constitutional Convention on Dáil reform. The Bill must be seen in the wider context of Oireachtas reform. The programme for Government sets out an ambitious political reform agenda across a number of Departments including radical reform of local government, regulation of lobbying, steps to encourage more women to run for political office and a programme of Oireachtas reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> We have introduced many reforms to the Oireachtas. We opened up the law-making process by introducing a new pre-legislative stage where Oireachtas committees can consult with individuals and civil society groups on the draft heads of legislation before it has been published. We introduced a system which allows Deputies to draft Bills, introduce them into the Dáil outlining their content and seek to have their Bills selected for a Second Stage debate on a Friday.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">In Article 15 he mentioned the "power to ensure freedom of debate". Freedom of debate is not enough. Members must have freedom to make decisions based on how they debated in a discussion. I speak as somebody who is not a member of a political party and who is, therefore, not bound by the Whip system. I have the freedom and independence to make up my own mind on votes. It is almost a luxury. In my six years here, there have been occasions on which I have voted with both the previous and current Governments. A major disadvantage of the Whip system is the way it polarises opinion. It is almost like a herd mentality. One must vote a certain way, and there is no outlet for individual thinking or independent thought. It must be very frustrating being in a political party. Given that it is impossible to agree 100% with everything a party decides, there must be times when one fundamentally disagrees with something one's party has proposed. Under the Whip system, one must vote for it regardless of one's beliefs.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> When thinking about the Bill, I was struck by two examples of this. During the previous Dáil, there was a vote on a proposed ban on stag hunting. There were people on the Government side who were against the ban being imposed and, equally, some in opposition who had to oppose the Bill and support retaining the stag hunt. There were active animal welfare supporters in both Labour and Fine Gael who had to vote against it. Is that democratic? Some weeks ago there was a Private Members' debate on a human rights approach to budgets and equality proofing. Many speakers on the Government side acknowledged the value and positive aspects of what I was trying to do. Anybody who did not know the system would have thought there was almost unanimous thinking on it. However, when it came to the vote it was a different story.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> It always strikes me on Tuesday and Wednesday nights that people come in to watch from the Gallery as their issues are debated. While they come in thinking and hoping the vote will be in their favour, we all know the outcome has been decided well before the topic is even discussed. When one crosses the floor from this side to the Government side, one inherits this all seeing, all knowing persona. While we are all flawed human beings and nobody has all the answers, collectively we might do a better job if we could work in a more collegial and congenial way. If we could all learn from each other it could make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Why are so few amendments to Bills accepted by Governments? It is due to the assumption that once one is sitting in the Government seats, one has all the wisdom and all the right answers. I do not know if it is something in the air on that side of the House. Equally, Opposition Members are put in a position in which they must oppose, which they might not always agree with. We have a very strong party discipline and a very tight Whip system. Statistics show Ireland has almost a full record of party unity in voting. In the past 30 years, 54 individual Deputies voted against their parties, just 3% of all elected Deputies who were party members. There does not appear to have been any major gain or loss because those people did that.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> In the UK system there is some flexibility in the three-tier system whereby there are times when it is absolutely essential to vote with the party and times when votes are less important and it is possible to vote against the party. Most European systems employ a Whip system to a lesser extent than here while, for example, the US, New Zealand, Australia and other countries allow for conscience votes. Deputy Mathews is using the German example.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> It is proposed here to place the Deputy beholden to his or her own judgment when deciding the merits or demerits of a Bill. A central issue is representation. We are elected by constituents and we represent them to the best of our abilities. We know the principles, policies and values on which they elect us, whether or not we are members of a party. However, there must be some flexibility. There are many instances in which Deputies on both sides of the House know they are not acting in the best interests of their constituents when they have to vote the way they are told by their parties, and this undermines democracy. What is being proposed would give Deputies a degree of protection from arbitrary party intentions and they would be left freer to vote as they think would best represent their principles and those of their constituents. A recent survey shows that there is an appetite for some reform and relaxation of the Whip.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I was a member of the Constitutional Convention and while this issue was not one of the topics, there was discussion at the Dáil reform meetings arising from the surprise on the part of the citizen members that party members did not have freedom. There was a suggestion that the Ceann Comhairle should be elected by secret ballot rather than appointed by the Government. Although I sometimes wonder about the accuracy and validity of opinion polls, Independent Members are doing very well in the polls and have the highest rating of any block. We vote outside the party system and I wonder if that is part of the reason for the increased support for us. While there are arguments that voting freedom would lead to a weakened and fractured Parliament, we can strike a workable balance. Parliaments can be effective with conscience voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">I accept lines must be drawn and that a Whip system must be in place for certain Bills. Otherwise, we would have elections several times a year. We should begin with this Bill - with a free vote. Let us test the viability and desirability of the proposal and give it a chance. The question must be asked: "What is the point of having Private Members' Bills and so much work going into them when their passage or progress is totally dependent on one side of the House?"</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_34">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_64">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this new and radical legislation, the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas) Bill and commend and thank Deputy Peter Mathews on bringing it forward. The Bill sets out a clear vision for the Dáil and, above all, for the people. It is about vision, reform, real democracy and respect for difference and diversity. Above all, it is about creating space for different views and about making this House and the broader political area more inclusive and democratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Before I go into the details of the Bill, I remind the Government and all Members that one of the reasons so many people and citizens are disillusioned and fed up with bad politics is because of the absence of this type of legislation. Who is afraid of reform, of change and of letting people make decisions on the basis of conscience? These are the questions I put to the Government and this is what this debate is about. We need to focus on that. </p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The purpose of the Bill is to effect an amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution, by inserting a new section 16 which will provide that all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience. It is important we look carefully at the detail of the wording proposed by Deputy Mathews. The Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be "representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience". I would emphasise the words "representatives of the whole people" and "conscience".</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> The Bill also deals in a strong and effective way with ending the abuse of the whip system, which erodes and undermines parliamentary democracy. We all need to reflect on this focus of the legislation. This would bring a new direction and should be part of any democratic reform or new vision for the country. The Bill is based on the German model and I will go into more detail on the significance of that later. There are ample examples of other countries where this approach towards the Whip system has worked. We have seen how this works in the House of Commons, on issues like the war in Iraq, we have seen it operate in the Netherlands and in New Zealand, where it has operated since 1891. We have also seen it operate in Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The proposed section 16 will provide that all Members of the Dáil and Seanad shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience. The issue of "conscience" is important. Many of us have political differences. I have political differences from Deputy Mathews on some issues, but I will always defend and respect the right of everybody to decide on issues based on their beliefs. I have major conscience issues with regard to the silence of many people on issues such as the fact disclosed this morning that 135,000 children are living in dire poverty in this State. I also had a major issue of conscience when the Government cut the respite care grant by 19% for people with an intellectual disability. I have also major concerns when I see young sick children being denied a medical card or when I see children with disabilities being excluded. These are all issues of conscience and it is important we point that out in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I support this legislation and commend Deputy Mathews on its introduction. The Bill is about respecting democratic principles, reform and freedom of conscience. Above all, it is about respecting and enjoying the differences and diversity of our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">I am an atheist, so I am not here by providence. I am here by choice, because I respect the work that Deputy Mathews has put into this Bill and appreciate his motivation. He has provided us with a good opportunity to discuss crucial issues such as why we are elected, who we represent, to whom we are accountable and, in essence, what is democracy. I would be shy about holding up any role models of democratic states. Be they in Lithuania or elsewhere, I have not seen an ideal system and do not put that forward. However, I am sure Deputy Mathews is correct that the system we have here could be considerably better than what it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> It is a little rich to have to sit here and listen to the Minister of State talk about Dáil reform, when we have had guillotines and when we have a situation where when people like me who have been elected under a party banner, move away from that party, that party has the option to keep moneys that were associated with our election. The party benefits and wins and I do not believe that is democratic. It is great we have the opportunity to bring forward Bills here, but it would be far better if the Government took some of them on board. I think just one Bill raised in this process has not been opposed, but it is still buried in a committee somewhere. This process is very much token adherence to so-called "democracy". Therefore, with this Bill, Deputy Mathews has given us an important opportunity to look at the party system.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> The Minister of State suggested that the reason for the party system is to mould a group of people into an effective unit, that it united the disparate Irish MPs under Parnell so that they could come together and take great strides forward. I do not buy that at all. It is supposed to be the case that if one is dealing with a political party, one knows what one is getting - that people stand for election on a certain ideological basis and on certain policies that flow from that. However, people know that is not the case. In the most recent election, we had a supposed democratic revolution through the ballot box. People voted for something completely different, opposing Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, but they got the exact same thing in Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> In fact, one can be in any party one likes, once one delivers for neoliberal capitalism. It does not really matter other than that. After that, it is a kind of window dressing. This is why we have had a complete alienation of ordinary people from the political system, including the people of Wexford the Minister of State mentioned who voted for him. I am sure many of them voted for him on the basis of the Fine Gael programme which stated Fine Gael would not introduce a home tax because people invest so much in their property over their lifetime or because of the struggles of young couples who could not afford mortgages. Fine Gael also said it would not introduce water charges unless everybody had a meter. Is it any wonder people are alienated?</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The Whip system serves one purpose only, to preserve the <i>status quo.</i> It is a mechanism to immunise those in power from the pressure of people outside this House. It introduces rigidity and is inflexible in its operation. How many times have we seen people in this House pretend or claim to represent the people in their constituencies, but hiding behind the decision they made under the Whip system which was opposed to the wishes of those people? We have seen a greater affront in some ways, where people have lost the Whip on a local issue because they do not want "my hospital" closed down. However, they were quite happy to vote for the closure of other hospitals in areas where people did not have an opportunity to vote against them. It is this type of gombeenism and parish pump politics that has people completely turned off our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> We should be accountable for all of the actions we take. We should be big and bold enough for that. I believe a machine which basically decides through its resources whether somebody gets elected is undesirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">We have a huge problem here with a lack of genuine debate on issues because of the Whip system. For example, my own Private Members' Bill on the area of fatal foetal abnormalities and the need for provision for abortion in those cases will be up in the next session. There are 50 Deputies in the current Dáil who are on record as supporting the need for reform in that area, Members of every single party and a raft of Independents. Is it going to see the light of day? Are the families affected by this issue going to have their concerns addressed? I very much doubt it, but maybe the Government will surprise me this time around.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> If we had a real democracy, there would be an opportunity for the people to have a right to recall midway through. Why should anyone put an X beside somebody's name in a ballot box thinking they are getting some package or individual to fight for them, and have to wait five years before they are able to do anything about it? A real democracy would empower people with the right to recall their representatives midway through the electoral cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> We could deliberate over matters of conscience for a very long time. I support the idea of Deputies being given a free hand in all issues, having genuine debate and then standing before the people. However, there are many issues people might deem to be what are termed "issues of conscience" which are really issues that people should be left to decide for themselves. It should not be the property of Deputies to be able to deny somebody in society the right to exercise their human right of expression, privacy or similar. The reality is that sometimes our legislation cuts across human rights rather than delivering them. </p>
          <p eId="para_79"> It is very welcome that we have been given the opportunity to discuss these issues. I compliment Deputy Mathews for introducing the Bill. We should be spending more time teasing this out because everybody knows that the system we have is completely unrepresentative of the wishes and the viewpoint of the people. I do not propose to have all the answers but it is very good that people in here are beginning to ask the right questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">Looking at this amendment proposed by Deputy Mathews, I would like to focus primarily on two points. The first relates to the role of the politician and his or her duty to the people, and second to the question of issues of conscience and their place in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> Ireland's electoral system of single transferable vote proportional representation makes ours technically one of the most open in the world. A study carried in 2012 by UCD academics found that, while more open electoral systems tend to increase the likelihood of politicians breaking party ranks, Ireland has a relatively low rate of politicians voting against the party line. Between 1981 and 2010, 54 Deputies lost the Whip due to breaking the party line. According to the study, 63% of those who lost the Whip in this period never went on to enjoy any further political career advancements afterwards. I am sorry to tell Deputy Mathews that.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">While the Whip system is not actually enshrined in our legislation, we see here that in practice it disincentivises questioning or criticising the <i>status quo</i>. Democratically elected representatives' principal relationship should be with the electorate rather than with the views of the party leadership. The example of the German system is worth noting in this regard, as it allows for parties to adopt a joint position on issues while also permitting individual MPs the right to deviate from the party line without fear of expulsion from the party. The amendment proposed by Deputy Mathews would help make our system more open and democratic, and as such I fully support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> However, the real issue we should be examining is the much larger question of what, if anything, should constitute a question of conscience. Unfortunately, in Ireland the term "issue of conscience" is used more often than not in the context of sexual and reproductive rights, a result of the severe hangover still felt due to our repressive Catholic past. We have still not achieved a meaningful separation of church and State. We do not have to look too far back to find examples of this, namely the Eighth amendment of the Constitution. Although we are legally bound by a number of international human rights conventions, the fact that sexual and reproductive rights remain constrained by our Constitution is a disgrace. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that, "everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence".</p>

          <p eId="para_91">For repeated violations of this basic human right and the unjust interference of the State in the private lives and decisions of its citizens, Ireland has lost a number of high-profile cases at the European Court of Human Rights, notably Norris <i>v.</i> Ireland relating to gay rights, and more recently A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland, which attempted to deal with Ireland's draconian abortion legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Theology and religious concerns must be separated from legislation so that the religious beliefs of one person are not imposed on another to the detriment of their human rights under international conventions. Although I do have reservations regarding the use of the word "conscience", I support the principle of this amendment because in a democratic society, the voices of individual politicians should not be constrained by the party leadership. Politicians should be free to make individual and independent decisions and encouraged to question the <i>status quo</i> without fear of retribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I welcome the debate. There are a number of issues that need further consideration, such as the definition of "conscience". I am trying to imagine a situation where this would be accepted and we would have a public debate. We would have to define just exactly what is meant by votes of conscience. Our Constitution at present only insists on two things regarding the stability of a Government, and those are that if it falls on a money Bill or a vote of confidence, it will force a general election. We do have elements in our Constitution at the moment, but it is not the way party politics operate. It works in theory but not in practice, like many things.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> People perceive political parties and the excessive use of the Whip system as being more or less a means of running private clubs. Less than 3% of the population belongs to a political party, a shocking number.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Essentially, the view is that party comes first and constituent or citizen second. There was an expectation of ambitious reform, and what we got was superficial reform. That is part of the reason there is greater support for independents now. It is a very deliberate choice that if the party system will not reform politics here, the citizens will force reform by virtue of breaking a system that they see as not operating in their interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> The system designs outcomes that favour particular classes of people. It is no surprise that people, almost by accident, tend to thrive in that situation - sometimes people who have close associations with political parties and indeed, perhaps, have funded and still fund them. The definition is important. Returning to Deputy Daly's words, I do not go as far as saying I am an atheist but I am certainly an agnostic. I would take the humanist approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">The notion that one has to be religious, for example, to have a conscience, is nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I have a conscience about things like poverty, people being on trolleys in our hospitals, the way we manage our services and property being described as something people live in when it is in fact a family home - I see it as shelter. We could mention many issues which could come within the definition of "conscience", but I do not think we should mix up the difference between conscience and a free vote. </p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I read a paper on free votes and votes of conscience in Germany which was delivered in Dublin. One of the issues was smoking in public and legislation on tobacco consumption in Germany. I was surprised to see such an issue included because it is generally perceived that what is considered in the Bill in terms of conscience tends to be about reproductive rights. There is a free vote in the UK Parliament on the issue of the death penalty. I would certainly have a conscience about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> The definition of "free votes" or "votes of conscience" has to be part of any debate if one is to consider changing the Constitution. We need changes to our Constitution. In fact, we need a whole new Constitution. The stranglehold the Government places on the Parliament is an issue which was not envisaged by the drafters of our Constitution. The larger the majority the Government has, the less democracy we see. The punitive measures taken when people leave a party result in people being made unelectable, which is probably no accident. It removes many rights, such as the right to be on a committee and table amendments to Bills. In terms of political funding, the party is funded but the mandate is not respected. </p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The Government talked about reform. I could not be more critical of what actually happened. I remember the night we debated the promissory notes. We had a late briefing and relied on Twitter for information on what would happen that night. When we got a briefing at about 10 p.m. our group discussed what was in the Bill. We were encouraged by all sorts of media outlets to go and talk to them in advance of reading the Bill. There was no shortage of Government Deputies to speak on a Bill they had not even read. The system, as we see it, turns people into sheep. It turns people who are capable of making a greater contribution into Government voting fodder. If we need changes to our Constitution, I suggest they are far more fundamental and go to the heart of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I reiterate the point that definition is a key issue. I know the Government will not take this Bill. I introduced a Bill which the Government did not oppose. It concerned planning legislation and proposed to rebalance the rights of people who bought houses and found themselves living in unfinished estates which they could not get taken in charge. It involved a litany of day-to-day practical things on which I had done some research and knew backwards and forwards because they have been a staple matter for me for the past 20 years. The Bill went to Committee Stage and I was encouraged to take it off the agenda on the basis that the Planning (No. 2) Bill would come forward and include many of the same provisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_107"> I did not expect the Bill to include everything. I met senior officials from the Department and went through what was intended in detail. I thought it was a very productive meeting and expected to see something happen. Not even a line was included. </p>
          <p eId="para_108"> One has to ask about the monopoly on wisdom the Taoiseach said the Government did not have when it gives the impression that these Friday sittings are of value. They give the impression that things are considered, but in fact that is where reform should have manifested itself. The Government would say Friday sittings and increasing the number of hours of debate are reforms, but they are meaningless.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I was conscious of that. I will be quite brief because many things have been said and I am not going to repeat the points which have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I welcome this debate, and congratulate Deputy Mathews on introducing the Bill and having a check on the current situation. The very last point made by Deputy Murphy was that these sittings are supposed to be about reform. I do not want to be in the Chamber for every Friday sitting because sometimes what is discussed does not affect what I am doing. However, the Chamber is almost empty and people will vote on Tuesday on something they have not listened to, debated, thought about or developed an opinion on. That is one of the crucial points regarding the Whip. One comes in and votes the way the Government tells one to vote. It raises the question of parliamentary democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I am also an atheist. I am here by choice. I have a deep conscience. I am not saying anybody else does not; others do. We live in a society where lobby groups put major pressure on people regarding economic issues. At the time of the bank bailout, Timothy Geithner, the ECB and the troika all told the Irish people they had to take on the responsibility and bear it on their shoulders, and they would make sure they did so because nobody else would help them. That was true. Lobbying took place behind the scenes and pressure was put on the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> I hate the term "pro-life" because it is not pro-life. There are fundamentalist groups, such as Opus Dei and others, which put significant pressure on individuals in these political Chambers, and that has to be examined. There are Bills on lobbying, but the question of who is going after who in regard to their own agendas needs to be much clearer. In Europe lobbyists work 24-7. Water companies, oil companies and others put major pressure on the European Council to force agendas through, such as the privatisation of services, where they will make their next quick buck and how they can put pressure on, take control of and make money from public services. </p>
          <p eId="para_116"> We saw that happen with the TTIP legislation. People do not really understand it and there should be a debate on it. A Canadian one has also been developed. These are crucial issues. In the Canadian trade investment programme, it is said that once water comes from the ground it is fair game. Such companies then go to Europe and demand that companies be set up so they can be developed and privatised in the future. That is another issue in the Water Services Act which the Government did not take on. It did not address the significant concerns of the citizens of the State regarding the privatisation of our water. It would not even call a referendum on the issue or take the fact it was an issue on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">These are issues where parliaments from national level to European and international level do not reflect the consciences of elected people. We were talking about recall. We have one of the most progressive electoral systems in the world, but the key thing is recall. I might stand before the people and say as one of my key planks that if elected I will not go into government with right-wing established parties. Once elected, however, I might say "They are offering me something and I might just take it". People should be able to recall me in those circumstances and say that I stood on a platform. Deputy Ruairí Quinn said he would not increase third level fees if elected and was on Merrion Street with a big cheque. He went into government and did exactly the opposite. The Taoiseach said the home is a man or woman's castle and that he would never bring in property taxes. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said water charges could not be introduced as every house would have to be metered, which was an impossibility. Those were lies. People go out and say one thing before coming to this Chamber and doing another under the protection of this building. The only time they go back out again is when the next general or local election comes up and they get feedback from the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> Conscience is broader than just social conscience. I had a difficulty where some Deputies who broke with Fine Gael voted in austerity cuts against respite grants and the other measures that were brought in. It should take a bigger band. If one is elected, one should support the mandate on which one is elected, but in certain areas one may feel very strongly on an issue. In Australia, one can write down why one is opposed to a measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and thank Deputy Peter Mathews for tabling it. The debate brings into focus the repressive whip system we have in Ireland. As outlined earlier from the Government side, the whip system was designed in 1875 by Charles Stewart Parnell. It is not from the last century but the one before that and it was outdated a long time ago. Much of the problem came to the fore during the current Dáil when I sat on the Government benches less than 100 days into its term of office. We had a vote here on the issue of Roscommon Hospital and the commitments that were given prior to the election. On foot of the whip system, Deputies are forced into having to choose between their livelihoods or their consciences, which is wrong. A system that forces people into that position is a failed one.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">There is no doubt that there needs to be a structure and a binding mechanism to implement decisions made by political parties or Governments, but the problem here is the absolute control held by so few. Their position on whatever the issue may be is not open to question no matter how flawed it is. We have a situation in Ireland currently where we have an Economic Management Council, or gang of four, comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. They make the decisions for the whole country. Those decisions are rubber-stamped by the Government and rammed through the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> An example of how that happens occurred during the passage of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act. I read all the submissions, sat through and listened to the hearings over the two separate sessions and made my decision based on the evidence before me. I proposed improvements to the law. The legislation proposed that a pregnant, vulnerable and suicidal woman who sought and was refused a termination under its provisions would be entitled to seek a review of the decision by presenting her case before a three-person medical panel. For any Member of the House to have to go before a panel of three medical professionals to argue any case would be a daunting task. It would be daunting for any professional, never mind for a woman who believes the decision taken by the panel will determine whether she lives or dies. When the legislation came through the House, I sought to ensure that under the law a woman would have a legal right to have someone accompany her when she sat in front of that panel. My proposal was rejected by the Government and voted down by a majority of Members in the Dáil. That happened because the decision was taken by the Economic Management Council - by the gang of four - that it would not accept any amendment whatsoever to that legislation. Even an amendment that was copper-fastening the principles of the legislation and protecting the rights of vulnerable women was forced down in the House because the gang of four had already made the decision that it would not entertain any amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> I come back to something the Minister said earlier in relation to my own case and how I was expelled from the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party. My decision to vote against the Government on the issue of Roscommon Hospital has been branded a parish pump issue. The facts are that in June 2009 a written commitment was sought and obtained from the Fine Gael Party on the future of emergency services at Roscommon Hospital by the Fine Gael group of councillors on Roscommon County Council. A revised and updated written commitment was sought and obtained from the party in June 2010. In December 2010, further revisions of that written commitment were sought by Roscommon Hospital Action Committee. It was issued for the third time by Deputy James Reilly in January 2011. During the general election campaign in February 2011, this written commitment was publicly endorsed locally in person by both the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the incoming Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore. It was the policy of both parties which subsequently formed the Government that they would retain emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital, but within 100 days of going into government, the Taoiseach, the then Tánaiste and the then Minister for Health reneged on that clear, unambiguous commitment to the communities in County Roscommon and east Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I could not nor would I go back on the commitment that was freely given by the Fine Gael Party and publicly endorsed as policy by the incoming Taoiseach and incoming Tánaiste. It comes down to whether one stands by one's word and by the platform one put forward to the people at election time and which was publicly endorsed by the national representatives of one's party on the ground in the constituency. It is an issue of honesty and integrity. In the circumstances, I had a choice whether to stand by my conscience, my word and the people who elected me on that mandate. That is why I pressed the red button when voting that night in July 2011. I stand by that decision today and I always will. Issues like that should not have to arise. They should be provided for within the Constitution to protect the individual rights of Members. Doing so would ensure that we had a far more effective and accountable democracy which the public as a whole would actually respect for a change instead of distrusting as they do currently every Member of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">-----but I do not believe in the Whip system for issues of conscience. I believe in it from the point of view of the allocation of resources and broad policy issues, for which one must have a Whip system. When I sat on the Government side of the House I voted for many policies and much legislation for which I did not like voting; who in his or her right mind would like to cut a respite grant? Equally, when I was in opposition for a number of years I voted against many Government proposals which were sensible and logical.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I do not for one moment purport to believe everyone on the Opposition side of the House is of one mind and holds the correct position while all in the Government are of the one mind and hold the incorrect position and <i>vice versa</i>. The House is made up of many diverse views. There are as many differences within political parties as there are across political parties and this should be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> The standing and stock of politicians and our political system has never been lower since the foundation of the State, and there are a number of reasons for this. One is the fact that we in the House have given away power as a body in general. We have many fine organisations but they are not accountable. These include the NRA, Tourism Ireland, Irish Water, the HSE and An Bord Pleanála. We have abdicated our responsibility. We go in front of the electorate and ask it to vote for a strong voice in a constituency in Dublin or Wicklow, but when we come here we hand over power. We go to public meetings and tell people an issue is outside our remit and we have no control. Members of the public then wonder why they vote for us if we have no power or accountability. I would like to see power and accountability come back to the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">I am doing so, very tightly. Trying to depict the Whip as a big bad ogre is not correct. Whips generally try to do the best they can. A pet hate of mine is hearing commentators state it suits politicians to have a Whip because it protects them from big business and protects them in their constituencies. A politician who needs the protection of the Whip should not be in politics. If one cannot stand on one's own two feet, and make one's own decision and live and die by it, one should not be in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> When I lost the Whip, aside from the ins and outs and rights and wrongs of the legislation what I found most debilitating and depressing was going to a parliamentary party meeting and listening to 20 or 30 individuals advocate a certain policy line very vehemently and strongly - I was not one of them - and when the leadership changed its position the majority of these people came in the following week and advocated a different line. Someone who stands for everything stands for nothing and I found this very depressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> We can start political reform in the House with a secret ballot for the Ceann Comhairle in the next Dáil. There has been recent speculation about the Ceann Comhairle stepping down. Perhaps he is being undermined by some in the Opposition, which I believe is wrong, or perhaps by some in the Government in respect of who should replace him. It would be damaging to the office, very damaging to the Government and even more damaging to the Houses of the Oireachtas if the Ceann Comhairle were to change before the next election. He is doing an excellent job in difficult circumstances. I hope he stays in the position and that those whispering to the media stop the speculation because it does not benefit anybody. I cannot overemphasise the importance of the Ceann Comhairle staying in position.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Due to the advent of social media, quick fixes and a misinterpretation of what people say, Deputies are often afraid to come here to articulate views or tease out issues, because the soundbite seems to be king at present. Substance is being neglected because of the emphasis on the soundbite and the misrepresentation fed by an uncontrolled social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I am in favour of the Whip system. I do not believe in not having a Whip system in the House as I do not believe it would work. The Bill would add to our democratic institutions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_148">I wholeheartedly agree with the Bill brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Peter Mathews, and congratulate him on bringing it before the House. Politicians should be able to reach their own decisions and should not have to vote against their conscience out of fear they will be expelled from their political party. If this amendment is introduced, elected representatives will be forced to have better knowledge on the subject matters on which they are voting. They will have to have an informed opinion on a subject instead of blindly following a party Whip and doing what they are told. Instead of putting their party first they would put the country and citizens first. The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas) Bill 2014 proposes to amend Article 15 of the Constitution to insert a provision to provide that all Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Since being expelled from the Fine Gael Party I have found it liberating to be an Independent Deputy, being able to weigh up each piece of legislation and every important item coming before the Parliament and being able to make a decision based on what is in the best interests of all of the people and not being pressurised by a party Whip. Voting in Parliament is a pointless exercise if we know what the result of the vote will be before it takes place. Governments introduce legislation knowing it will be passed because they have an absolute majority. This legislation may not be good for all of our citizens, but because the Government has strength of numbers it will pass and this is not good for society generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Too often politicians pander to party loyalty and vested interests. This Bill would make elected representatives more answerable to the electorate, by forcing them to make decisions and take a stand on issues. It is disheartening to see so many good and intelligent people in political parties on all sides of the House blindly following a party Whip considering they have their own ideas on certain issues. Unfortunately, many politicians see their career progression as being more important than the national interest, and if there is a slight chance of being promoted they will keep their mouths shut and go along with the groupthink which can occur within parties. It is not good for democracy that a small number of people decide on policy for a political party and that anyone who dissents from it is thrown out.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> If the Whip system were loosened and Deputies and Senators were given greater freedom when voting, it would create a much more interesting and vibrant Parliament with varying contributions and proper political debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Everybody would be allowed to have his or her own say, while still considering himself or herself to be a member of a political party. Just because a politician votes against his or her political party does not mean that he or she does not still hold the same policies, convictions and core principles as the party.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> As previous speakers stated, political reform was one of the cornerstones of the election promises made by Fine Gael in 2011. After the battering the country had received from the previous Fianna Fáil-led Administration, an overhaul of the political system was much needed. I believed that reform would be at the top of the Government's agenda but, sadly, that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Making changes to the Whip system is one area of reform that should have been a priority for the Government, in particular, for the Chief Whip. Free votes are provided on certain issues in most European countries and in modern democracies, such as New Zealand and Australia. Issues of parliamentary procedure or reform have also received free votes in the United Kingdom. In the past 40 years, there have been only three free votes in this Parliament. When one considers the various serious issues that have come before the Dáil, it is shameful that parties do not allow free votes, in particular, on issues of conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The Government should now go back to the drawing board. It needs to assess what is the standard procedure, particularly in the parliaments of our neighbours in Europe, especially the United Kingdom, and adopt a similar approach here in Ireland. Politicians must be able to vote with their conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Deputy Mathews' Bill needs to be seriously considered by the Government. I am disappointed with the response so far by Government. Perhaps it can further reflect on the issue and come back to it at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> As the late John F. Kennedy stated in a famous speech before his election as President of the United States, "I will make my decisions ... in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest". Why should parliamentarians in Ireland not be granted the freedom to do the same?</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_158">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the Bill which, if enacted, would lead to the Thirty-fourth amendment of the Constitution. At the outset, let me set out my party's position. Fianna Fáil is not opposed to advancing the Bill to Committee Stage for further debate. Fianna Fáil supports relaxing the Whip on specific matters of conscience and was the only party to do so in the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013. However, enshrining it in the Constitution may erode the Whip system in other areas, damaging the effectiveness and independence of the Oireachtas. The Bill should be debated carefully on Committee Stage to test its potential consequences before a final decision is taken and I will exhort the Government to seriously consider allowing the Bill to go to Committee Stage for further debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Holding a referendum on enshrining freedom of conscience may be unnecessary given the personal rights to freely express conditions and opinions already enshrined in Article 15 - dealing with the national Parliament - and Article 40, which applies to all citizens, including public representatives. Fianna Fáil believes the Whip should be relaxed within the party structure on matters of conscience such as abortion, euthanasia and stem cell research which evoke fundamental contentious issues. Removing the Whip system entirely, as this Bill may do, would be a legislative disaster for the country. Lobby groups would individually pick off members without the broader support of a party leading to policy stalemate and instability. The Whip system maintains group discipline in important policy matters. Relaxing it on specific matters of conscience rather than engaging in a free vote "free for all" is a positive step towards giving representatives more power.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> My party believes in a package of broader political reform that will address the deeper issues upon which Deputy Matthews' Bill touches. Members of the Dáil and Seanad must have a greater role in shaping policy. Making decisions in accordance with one's conscience is an essential feature of a liberal democracy. This is enshrined in the Constitution in the personal rights outlined in Article 40. Bunreacht Na hÉireann also protects the right to form political parties or other associations under Article 40.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> This legislation may be unnecessary in light of these already existent provisions in the fundamental law of the land. It is important the impact of the proposals upon the Whip system in its entirety is fully debated. The abolition of the Whip system in its entirety may allow for free votes rather than just votes of conscience. This means that the ability of parties to impose discipline on their members would be removed from all legislation that is not consensually agreed. This should be further debated at committee level.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> In his classic defence of political parties, the eminent statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke put forward a series of benefits that parties provide to a state, namely that they have an important role in formulating policy in the national rather than geographical interest, engaging candidates, providing transparency in their aims and, critically, providing the state with stability. The Whip system is an integral part of that. It is used to maintain discipline among party representatives to hold a common agreed line on divisive policy issues. This has been the standard practice in the Irish parliamentary tradition and in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> International experience shows that on issues that split voters, taking any policy decision is unattractive to parties geared towards elections. It leads to policy stalemate. This implies that besides the respect for the inalienability of a legislator's conscience, there is a strategic element for parties not to declare or even form a position on contentious issues involving morality. Removing the Whip will eliminate the strength and solidarity of a party in taking a firm position on ordinary policy and allow for lobby groups to pick off members one by one.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Decisions taken in the legislative arena affect not only the decision-maker but all those subject to the laws being passed thereby distancing the personal element one attaches to concepts such as morality and conscience. When voters cast their ballot in favour of a party, policy platform and representative, the Deputy has an obligation to reflect their views, not only his or her own. This is particularly relevant in non-first principle issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_177"> Every one of us has a conscience. My conscience, and issues of conscience, are not the exact same for me as for any other Deputy in this Chamber, and are not the exact same as for the 6,700 constituents who voted for me, but they put their trust in me because I went to them with a set of policies and guidelines on which I would vote, either in government or in opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I have stuck by that and I will suffer the consequences, as will everybody else in this Chamber, if and when the next election comes about, because at that stage the public will weigh up whether or not I did a good job and whether I lived up to my promises to them. My promise to them is my manifesto, my political programme. One of the reasons, probably the central reason, that political parties and politicians are held in low esteem is that they have not lived up to those political promises. They will suffer the consequences, as the party opposite them suffered the consequences in the last election. In the next election the Labour Party, in particular, will suffer the consequences of its refusal to stick by the promises it made to the electorate. That is why we have democratic elections. That is why we give the opportunity every five years - maybe it should be every four years, like America - to hold politicians to account. They can also hold politicians and their parties to account at other opportunities, as they did in the local elections. I am of the firm belief that the manifesto a political party produces is a social contract with the electorate. If that is not lived up to, one will suffer the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The argument behind this legislation is that there should be free votes on issues of conscience. Issues of conscience are different for different people. For me, every single budget is a conscience issue and one cannot run a country if every single vote on financial, judicial or on any legislation is open to a free vote, because then one will be hampered continuously. If every vote was a free vote, the lobbyists - those who have money behind them, extremists, those who are very vocal - would have much more say in what would happen in this Chamber. We have seen what happens in America, for instance - the pork-barrelling that goes on in every vote. Every time there is a budget, it goes on and on and nothing gets done. One need only look at the last two administrations and how everything was held up by that pork-barrelling. I agree that it happens to a degree here, but it does not happen to the same degree, and we should not open ourselves up to that type of influence on the Dáil in the future. That could be one of the unforeseen consequences of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Deputy Joan Collins said that party Deputies come to the House on a Tuesday and vote on the legislation that was discussed on a Friday, even though they have not been here - they just traipse in and vote whatever way the Whip tells them. The same is true of the vast majority of Independent Deputies, who are not here on a Friday either. They traipse in, without having taken part in Friday discussions, and vote, usually according to the advice given by somebody else. At least in a party, one has a spokesperson, who is here, who contributes and who is held accountable within the party for the position they are adopting. One places trust in them and in the Whips. Much of what we need is trust, within our parties, within the Dáil itself and between us and the electorate. The biggest challenge for us as parliamentarians is to win back that trust. We can only do so if we live up to the social contract we commit to when we go to the polls every five years or so.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I compliment Deputy Mathews on bringing it forward. This is essentially about political reform. It is important that we are having a debate about political reform, although it is also somewhat ironic. One of the big trophies this Government has claimed in respect of political reform is that it brought in the Friday morning sitting to enable Opposition and backbench Deputies to put forward legislation for consideration by the Government. In the four years this Government has been in power, has one piece of this legislation been enacted? No. We all know what this Friday sitting is about. It is about window-dressing. Its purpose is to enable the Taoiseach to say, "We sat X more hours in the week". If the Government was serious about reform, and had given Opposition Deputies and its own backbench Deputies a proper say, it would be looking at implementing some of the legislation. The Government often says it will not oppose such legislation, but it certainly never implements it. What continues to happen here, as in the past - it is not just this Government - is that the Executive is dominating the Dáil. The Members of the Dáil, whether backbench or Opposition Deputies, are not getting an opportunity for a meaningful and contributory role in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> We discussed the issue of guillotines, a mechanism the Government was so fond of using until it got caught on the hop in the run-up to last Christmas, when it guillotined that important legislation, the water Bill. It was only then, when it became widely known in public circles how the Government chose to guillotine the establishment of Irish Water, such an important piece of infrastructure, in the space of three hours, that things changed. I acknowledge that the use of guillotines has diminished since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> When the Government came to power, it was all about political reform and it was going to end cronyism. We know since they have come to power the two-to-one ratio in State appointments has been two for Fine Gael, one for the Labour Party. Where is the democratic revolution there? It is not there. Nowhere was this skulduggery and stroke politics more acutely witnessed than in the appointment of Councillor McNulty to fill the Seanad vacancy. We saw the true calibre of the democratic revolution and the true character of the fraud that is the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, when he made that political move. In respect of party funding, if the Taoiseach and the Executive were honest about political reform, when Deputies leave one party to join another party or the Independent benches, their allowances should move with them. Instead, this Government, despite having lost a number of Deputies from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, has held on to the allowances attributable to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Gender quotas were mentioned by the Minister of State earlier, in relation to how the Government is embracing and welcoming women into the Parliament. If it really wanted to welcome women into the Parliament, it is not about merely implementing gender quotas, it is about reforming how this Parliament works. It is about reforming the sitting times. If Government was really interested in promoting women, the Taoiseach should have used the opportunity he had in the promotion of Ministers of State at the last Cabinet reshuffle. He could have given women more say at the highest level of Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Despite the fact that our State was only established in 1922, just 93 years ago, it has a history of stability and democracy that stands in sharp contrast to many of our European neighbours. Our State in its history has faced many challenges, including civil war, near economic collapse and a long struggle with paramilitary groups. Despite this, the Irish people have never allowed the light of our democracy to be extinguished.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> To be proud of the stable democracy which the Irish people have built is not to be blind to the need for reform of our political institutions; rather, it is to accept that the zeal for reform must go hand-in-hand with preserving the achievements of past generations. It also recognises that the forces that often overwhelm and destroy democracy start life by assuring people they will reform the democratic system. The definition of reform, just like the definition of conscience, can be broad and depends totally on the individual viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> This morning's debate is a positive sign of the interest that exists across the Chamber in the area of Oireachtas reform. It is confirmation that this Government's commitment to Oireachtas reform and the steps we have taken to date and will continue to take in the future in this area, have opened up a debate on the issue of parliamentary reform that is both healthy and positive. For too long the inner workings of our Oireachtas were neither commented on nor considered except by a handful of experts. We have opened up that debate and I believe that ongoing parliamentary reform will be a feature of Oireachtas discussions from now on.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> No parliament is perfect; there is always room for reform and improvement. While I do not support this Bill or the change it proposes, I am proud that this Government has embraced the issue of Oireachtas reform and I look forward to the next phase of Oireachtas reform later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"><b>
						</b>It is not often I acknowledge the contribution of Sinn Féin or agree with Sinn Féin. However, I acknowledge that Deputy Ó Snodaigh in his contribution had the courage not to take the populist view of a political party just to support the Bill because he is on the Opposition benches. He had the courage as a Deputy in an Opposition party to oppose the Bill rather than take the populist view like other political parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> It is incredible that the Minister of State has avoided the debate entirely. There is no mention of parties in the proposal:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_225">AND WHEREAS it is proposed to amend Article 15 of the Constitution so as to provide that all members of the Dáil and Seanad shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience:</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> This is a solemn mandate from the whole people for their benefit and for their interests, not bound by orders or instructions from anywhere. Who mentioned the Whip? They will be responsible only to their conscience. Nobody mentioned anything about the neurotic religious type of training a person might have had from a mosque, a Catholic school, or as a Buddist, or whatever. It is the conscience of an adult human being, from the Latin word, <i>conscienta</i>, to know in entirety from the information, the facts and the situation to hand. It is unbelievable that the Minister of State wasted his Department's time getting speeches typed up and answering things that were not asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> If the Minister of State wishes to have a distraction I can deal with that very briefly. I refer to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which is independent. Its briefing document on the Bill states that the reasons members tend to vote along party lines in parliamentary democracies may differ from parliament to parliament. One factor that has been used to explain the strength - I would call it the iron grip - of the Whip in Irish politics or political parties and almost, but not quite to the same extent in the UK, is the power of party leaders over the careers of politicians. In my view, that is not a nice thought. For example, party leaders control jobs, Cabinet seats, committee chairs and electoral resources and to a degree, candidacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I will give the House an example. On one of the Bills enacted in 2013, the press reported openly and transparently that 15 people in the Minister of State's party were agonising and wondering what to do as the voting dates passed. There was an announcement and a statement correctly reported in the media that the leader of the party said that any member of the party who did not intend to support party policy would never stand again in any future election. That is where Ireland was in July 2013. Also in July 2013, when one person, who happens to be the party's leader and our Taoiseach, had it in his head to abolish the Seanad, a Bill was drawn up to abolish the Seanad. It passed through this House and the Seanad under the Whip system. This Bill we are discussing today does not deal with the Whip system; it is a constitutional matter. The Seanad is a constitutional institution and our Taoiseach wanted to abolish it. He and his colleague, the Tánaiste, told their members they had to vote for the abolition of the Seanad, that it was a simple case of abolishing the Seanad. When that vote was passed under the Whip, they said to the people - which was an untruth - that we had to do this in order to bring it to the people for their decision. What a lie. I use the word, "lie" and I do not withdraw it. That was a disgusting perversion of democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">Okay, I will say, "untruth". But it is disgusting that after that statement by the leader of the Minister of State's party who is now the Taoiseach, ten people changed their minds and five people fell. That is the result of 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I went to the Seanad to listen to that debate and the manipulation was incredible. They tried to tell us that the Bill was a case of preparing the runway for the people to decide whether there would be a Seanad. The people were not fooled and they are not fooled as they turn out about water charges which is again another Bill that was pushed through under a whip. I want to now stop talking about the whip. I want to talk about the safeguard for all of us in this House, that we work for the people and we debate for the people and we hold the Government to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Last night I received a note from a wonderful lady, a hero of the 21st century. Her name is Elaha Azinfar, an Iranian. She works with Maryam Rajavi, who is also a hero, a Mahatma Gandhi-type figure of our time, holding out for the liberation of the Iranian people from the Supreme Leader and mullahs of Iran, who govern their own people tyrannically. Ms Azinfar resists bravely, having lost relatives to execution and imprisonment. Her note states, "Dear Peter, good luck with tomorrow's debate". She has sent me a little package of truthful information.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The Taoiseach did not even send me a text. I met him last Thursday just outside the doors of the Chamber and said to him there is nothing to be afraid of in this Bill. It is a constitutional safeguard and does not refer to procedures. Rather, it sets out an atmosphere for us all to work for the people. I asked the Taoiseach not to be afraid and told him that, as leader of this country, he should claim the Bill and bring it into the Chamber as the<i> modus operandi </i>reflecting our duty and solemn responsibility to our people, irrespective of whether there are parties, coalitions or majorities, or whether there is a Parliament entirely comprised of Independents.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"><b>
						</b>I gave an example of a hypothetical new party with unanimous approval for its policies and outlined the circumstances that would obtain if there were an event that rendered those policies inappropriate for the well-being of the country. I outlined why it would be necessary for a Member to use his conscience and not a scrupulous neurotic checklist from early childhood. I refer to a grown-up conscience that ordains what is not appropriate and that would lead a servant of the people to change policy. Any fool who does not do so is letting down the people. What is the Taoiseach afraid of? The Government has between now and Tuesday to liberate its supporters as true parliamentarians so they will make up their own minds on this proposal for the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The Taoiseach thanked me for my proposal and I asked him to run with it, take the credit and do the laps of honour around Croke Park for getting it into our Constitution to safeguard our parliamentarians. He thanked me and said he appreciated that. Do Members know what he did over the weekend? I asked the Chief Whip, Deputy Paul Kehoe, what was happening and for a sounding on this, and he said the Government would not be supporting it. I asked him what he was afraid of. I asked the Taoiseach during the lull before a vote what happened over the weekend and he said he had to take advice from the Attorney General. That is rubbish; he does not. This is a new constitutional proposal. The country needs to know that the Attorney General is the servant of the Government and protects it from breaking the law or acting contrary to the Constitution. That is his or her job. For the Taoiseach to say he took advice from the Attorney General is rubbish. How dare anybody with such authority and power, and with such a majority, try to fool us.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Where is the Taoiseach? Is he at Davos? I stated we are lucky to be debating this Bill because the choice of business is a lottery. The Bill was drawn out like a ticket. It is a ticket that is worthy and that can save us. This type of constitutional provision saves Germany, Lithuania and all the other countries I mentioned. It saves their parliamentarians from the dangers of infiltration, undermining activities and corruption of power. Members will have heard about the EMC and such phenomena. Let us pay attention to the amber lights. Are we to tear up the lottery ticket that brought about this debate today? It is a winner for the people of Ireland and the Parliament. Do not tear it up, please.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_243">That Dáil Éireann considers the Report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht entitled 'Report on the Outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2013', which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 20th November 2014."</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss the report on the outline heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2013 by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The many developments at national, EU and international levels since the publication of this Bill in November 2013 and, more particularly, the publication of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 make it timely to review the recommendations contained in the report as we chart our way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Climate change is happening. We face risks of abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible damage, and responding now will lower the risk and cost of taking action. The time has long since passed when the vast majority of people accepted the science and reality of climate change, and they have demanded action. The scientific community has convened conferences, published reports, spoken out at forums and proclaimed, through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organisation, that climate change puts the well-being of people of all nations at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Climate change is one of the key issues facing the world today and it is vital that we formulate the necessary policy and legislation to help Ireland move to a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable economy and society. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4° Fahrenheit over the past 100 years. The sea level is rising and some types of extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy precipitation events, are happening more frequently. Earth's climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over millions of years. As global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth's climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible damage. Therefore, we must find agreement on actions that will ultimately turn the temperature down.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> We have taken a bit of a battering over recent weeks. The recent sequence of storms has caused chaos and havoc, battering homes, businesses and farms across the country. Last summer was the hottest recorded since records began. This clearly demonstrates to us that climate change is not some abstract academic idea or a phenomenon that might happen at some time in the distant future; it is very much here.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Climate change is real and the power and frequency of the pattern of unpredictable weather is a testament to that fact. Waiting to take action will inevitably increase costs, escalate risk and foreclose options to address the risk. The carbon dioxide we produce accumulates in Earth's atmosphere for decades or centuries, or even longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> It is not like pollution from smog or wastes in our lakes and rivers, where levels respond quickly to the effects of targeted policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> The effects of CO2 emissions cannot be reversed from one generation to the next until there is a large-scale, cost-effective way to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Moreover, as emissions continue and warming increases, the risk increases. If left unchecked, it has the potential to severely damage not only our environment, but also our economy and our quality of life. It may also have major economic consequences for our essential indigenous sectors such as agriculture and food production. There is also a growing economic and political consensus that the costs of inaction will greatly outweigh the cost of action. By making informed choices now, we can reduce risks for future generations and ourselves and help communities adapt to climate change. People have responded successfully to other major environmental challenges such as acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer with benefits greater than costs and there are ways to manage the risks of climate change while balancing current and future economic prosperity but paying lip service to the problem will not make it go away.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Government has committed to legislating in this area. Legislation is the best way to make sure that all Departments across Government, and all Departments across time, take climate change seriously and take action consistently. We have to hardwire action and accountability on climate change into the political system. In response to that demand, the Labour Party became the first party in Ireland to publish a Climate Change Bill in 2009. The programme for Government committed to publishing a Climate Change Bill to "provide certainty surrounding government policy and provide a clear pathway for emissions reductions, in line with negotiated EU 2020 targets".</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> This report represents the culmination of lengthy and wide-ranging consultations by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and Gaeltacht and led to the agreed outline of climate change legalisation. Months of lengthy hearings provided all stakeholders with a chance to air their views on the draft heads and this report reflects many of the observations made. The report contains credible proposals on how to ensure that our climate policies are rolled out in an efficient and effective manner. I welcome the fact that key recommendations in the report on the heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill 2013 form the key pillars of the recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015. The Bill has taken into account some key points of the report, including the establishment of the expert advisory group overseeing Ireland's progress on tackling climate change and proposes that it report annually on the progress being made by Ireland and can publish the report 30 days following presentation to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Another recommendation included in the Bill means all relevant Ministers will report on an annual basis to the Dáil. This will greatly increase the level of scrutiny of the carbon reduction measures being implemented across Government. Overall scrutiny of the progress being made on climate change will be strengthened by the production of a new low carbon road map every five years, instead of seven as originally proposed. Most important, we will ensure that Ireland's EU targets become our national targets and put a legal obligation on the State to show how it intends to comply with them. The report and the Bill also state that any EU or international target Ireland signs up to will automatically become legally binding, whether that is for 2030 or 2050, and the national roadmaps would then be required to match that target.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> This is the first time that a coherent and legislative response has been developed to the threat of climate change. The Bill will be one of the most important to come before the Dáil and the Seanad this year, and potentially years to come. This legislation sets us apart and will make Ireland one of the few EU member states to have adopted climate change legislation and one of the first to put a legal obligation on its Government to develop policies to plan for existing and future climate change commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> With challenges also comes opportunity. We must remember there is an opportunity for Ireland to develop a green low-carbon environment and industry that is green aware. Our economic recovery is not divorced from environmental issues. The two go hand in hand. Our economic recovery presents a chance to rebuild in a more sustainable way, creating jobs in agriculture, food, marine and tourism-based initiatives. Effective legislation can help make Ireland a hub for green enterprise and innovation. Many Irish companies have established their credentials as world leaders in providing green goods and services internationally and their innovations are contributing to EU and international efforts to lower emissions and decarbonise our economies. Our beef and dairy production is among the most carbon efficient in the world. Irish food producers have a vital role to play in providing a sustainable source of food into the future. The "Origin Green" brand has become a unique selling point for Irish food and drink worldwide. With regard to the wider economy, by improving resource efficiency, introducing different business models or offering more sustainable products and services, companies can expand their markets and create new jobs, while transforming existing ones. It is our job now to ensure Ireland has a strong legislative response to the threat of climate change. The time for action is now. I look forward to an informed and robust debate on this report and forthcoming legislation. We are ambitious for action on climate change policies, and this report is a tangible and positive step forward in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> I would like to record my sincere appreciation to all members of the joint committee and I would like to acknowledge the role played by the clerk to the committee, Mr. Eugene Ó Cruadhlaoich, and Professor John Sweeney in helping us compile the report and the facilities and support provided to us by the Library and Research Service of the House. As other members will attest, we sat through public hearings in the basement of Leinster House 2000 during exceptionally fine weather two years ago to take submissions. While other colleagues were on a break, we experienced at first hand the effects of climate change. It was almost an anomalous sign that we should get the work done as quickly as possible. All the contributions, particularly by the committee members, were valued and valuable. We invited in disparate groups from academia and the science and NGO sectors. For example, we heard from the IFA and IBEC and many people made submissions to the committee. The report was compiled on that basis and it was significant that there was unanimous agreement when it was published in late 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> People often remind Members of actions that are not taken or that do not happen quickly enough. I would like people to cast their cast minds back to the controversial manifesto the Labour Party used for the 2011 general election. It stated, "Labour's Climate Change Bill will provide certainty about Government policy and a clear pathway for emissions reductions in line with negotiated EU targets", while the programme for Government states, "We will publish a Climate Change Bill that will provide certainty surrounding government policy and provide a clear pathway for emissions reductions, in line with negotiated EU 2020 targets". In 2007 when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Green Party Government was formed, the Green Party talked a great deal about introducing climate legislation but that never happened for obvious reasons. It was one of the great pities of that Administration. While it will always be remembered for the economic circumstances that brought about its demise, this was one of the key areas in which I had hoped legislation would be introduced during that era, particularly when there was a booming economy and the pressure on our environment was more severe. However, it is happening now and I look forward to chairing Committee Stage of the Bill. I thank all those who were involved or associated with the production of the report.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_258">As the House will be aware, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 was published last Monday. I acknowledge the substantial work done by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and, in particular, its Chairman, Deputy Michael McCarthy, in laying the groundwork for what has become the published Bill. Publication of the joint committee's report was an important milestone in shaping the debate on the legislation. The report informed, in a genuine and meaningful fashion, the further development of the heads of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> While the report did not make recommendations as such, it outlined a number of possible courses of action that might be considered in the further development of the heads of the Bill. As the joint committee made considerable efforts in preparing its report, it is only right that I spend some time addressing each of these possible courses of action. In the first instance, the committee proposed that Ireland's existing annual greenhouse gas emission limits, as agreed under the European Union's so-called effort sharing decision of 2009, constitute the required mitigation objectives of the Bill for the period 2013 to 2020. The Government agrees with this approach. However, as the targets set down under the effort sharing decision are already legally binding on Ireland, there was no need to explicitly include them in the legislation. It should be noted that the Bill, as published, explicitly refers to the European Union's effort sharing decision as one of the existing obligations on the State which must be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The second possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that Ireland's annual emission limits for the periods to 2030, 2040 and 2050 should ultimately be agreed by member states under the EU Roadmap 2050 or any future burden sharing arrangement agreed at EU level. I am pleased to note that the committee and the Government are at one on annual emission limits up to 2050 and that they should arise from EU negotiations, rather than be unilaterally self-imposed in the Bill without regard to the wider EU and international sphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The third possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the intervals between proposed national low carbon roadmaps for emission reductions should be not greater than five years. An interval of seven years was proposed in the original outline heads of the Bill. Nonetheless, having regard to the committee's views, I am pleased to note that we took on board this advice and the published Bill specifies a five-year rather than a seven-year<i>
						</i>cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The fourth possible course of action is that the preparation of sectoral roadmaps for emission reductions should be subsequent to the publication of the national roadmap for the relevant period and should, in aggregation, be consistent with the prior targets established by the national roadmap. With respect, this advice is to somewhat misunderstand the process of preparing national roadmaps or national mitigation plans as they are now called in the published Bill. In this regard, the preparation of sectoral mitigation measures will be closely co-ordinated across Departments so as to ensure that, when aggregated, the subsequent national mitigation plan will provide for meeting the relevant mitigation targets. This co-ordination will be facilitated by extensive modelling work undertaken across the main emitting sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The fifth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that national policy for future agricultural emissions to 2050 should be predicated on the basis of zero emissions growth relative to 2013. This does not appear to be a realistic option having regard to Food Harvest 2020<i>, </i>the medium-term strategy for the development of the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors for the period to 2020. Moreover, it may be in contradiction of the committee's proposal in respect of carbon neutrality in agriculture, an issue to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The sixth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should investigate non-national-based emission management strategies at European Union level such as an agricultural emissions trading scheme, in which efficient and sustainable Irish agricultural practices would be rewarded with increased emission quotas. This advice did not specifically relate to the further development of the legislation; therefore, I will not dwell too much on it. However, suffice it to say I appreciate the intent behind the proposal in that it recognises Ireland's unique emissions profile, in which agriculture features prominently, not because of any lack of agri-efficiency but solely relating to the size of the agriculture sector relative to other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> The seventh possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that, in preparing the sectoral roadmaps for agriculture, a target of carbon neutrality should be established for 2050, with measurable progress towards it scheduled for 2020, 2030 and 2040. The intent behind this proposal is correct; carbon neutrality is the appropriate avenue of policy development in respect of future greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, by making use of appropriate carbon sinks. I am certain that the sectoral mitigation measures proposed for the agriculture sector will fully reflect this goal. </p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The eighth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that, for the purposes of the Bill, low carbon development should be interpreted as near zero emissions for 2050 in the energy, buildings and transport sectors and carbon neutrality in the agriculture sector. Since publication of the committee's report, further consideration was given to a national vision for low carbon development. The outcome was communicated with the publication, last April, of the national climate policy position, which sets out a long-term vision of low carbon transition based on an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors and, in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to 2050 as part of the EU process and that a long-term vision of low carbon transition has been set out in the national climate policy position, the Government does not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The ninth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the Bill should provide for the establishment of a national green climate fund ring-fenced within, or separate to, the environment fund. It would be used to support climate mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries and constitute Ireland's contribution to the international green climate fund established under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. While I applaud the intent, the reality of our fiscal situation militates against this course of action. In this regard, any future funding by Ireland of the international green climate fund should be part of the annual Estimates process, rather than a matter of statutory obligation. That is not to say nothing is being done in this regard. Despite difficult fiscal circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, including public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries. Although the vast majority of Ireland's annual climate finance flows through Irish Aid, Ireland's overseas development programme, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should be noted that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government also made a contribution of €33 million over two years during the fast-start finance period 2010-12 in supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund. Moreover, as articulated by the Minister, Deputy Alex White, in his Lima COP plenary address, despite our recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained flows of public climate finance at fast-start finance levels, delivering approximately €34 million in grants in 2013. We expect to match this in 2014 and are actively exploring all options for scaling up our mobilisation of climate finance, including in the green climate fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> The tenth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should consist of a chairperson and not more than five other members, all of whom should be independent of State or stakeholder interests, and that it should be supported by a technical secretariat, comprising the heads of the EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the ESRI. The Government does not share the committee's view in this regard. Pursuant to the published Bill, the expert advisory council will comprise a chairperson and between eight and ten ordinary members, four of whom shall be <i>ex</i>
						<i>officio </i>members comprising the heads of the four agencies. In appointing a chairperson and the ordinary members it is important to note that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for the effective performance of the council. The inclusion of the <i>ex</i>
						<i>officio </i>members will help to underpin this much needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field so as to ensure effective implementation. Accordingly, the Government is not minded to alter this arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The 11th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should exercise its functions independently and obtain the assistance of the technical secretariat in acquiring and processing data relevant to its activities. I do not believe the composition of the expert advisory council, as proposed in the published Bill, in any way prevents the advice emanating from this quarter from being anything other than independent and of the highest quality. Having the <i>ex</i>
						<i>officio </i>members on the council directly, rather than relegated to some technical secretariat, means that the advice provided by the council will be well informed, robust, up-to-date and, just as important, capable of being implemented in the real world.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">This is crucial to ensure those charged with implementing mitigation policy measures enjoy buy-in from the start.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The 12th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should be empowered to publish its annual reports subsequent to submitting them to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the committee. I am pleased to note that in the published Bill this advice has been taken on board and that the expert advisory council has been given the power to publish its annual and periodic review reports directly, after a short set period, following their submission to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The 13th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the annual transition report to Dáil Éireann should be concluded by a statement from the Taoiseach as chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change detailing the progress made in emissions reductions in the preceding year and outlining the programme for achieving the required reductions in each sector for the forthcoming year. The Government does not consider it appropriate that this role should fall to the Taoiseach, as climate change policy properly falls within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Accordingly, the Government believes it should fall to the Minister to make an overview statement as part of the annual transition report to Dáil Éireann, which constitutes an important exercise in transparency and openness. </p>
          <p eId="para_273"> As the House has heard, several of the joint committee's proposals were accepted in full and unequivocally. On others, however, agreement could not be reached. On others again, the intent, if not the letter, of the proposal found favour. That is probably the way things go. </p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I again thank the joint committee for its extensive work on the outline heads of the Bill and, in particular, its chairperson, Deputy Michael MacCarthy. It is obvious that the report was given genuine and detailed consideration and I am satisfied that it has promoted a better and more inclusive Bill than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_275">As a member of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I acknowledge the work done by it on the report, for which I cannot claim any credit because I was not a member at the time it was working on it. However, I know that a great deal of work was put into it by its members. It is very important that this work was done. I also welcome publication of the climate change Bill, to give it its brief title. It is the most important legislation the Government will introduce and something that will put people, not just in Ireland but throughout the world, to the pin of their collar. People seem to be hardwired to deal with imminent problems. It seems we are not hardwired to deal with a long-term problem or something that will hit us very hard in 20 years. That is the real problem people in Ireland and other countries have in tackling the issue of climate change. It is absolutely vital to the well-being of all of us on the globe that we tackle the issue quickly. I hope that on this occasion we can see that our long-term interests must be protected immediately, rather than looking for short-term gains which may contribute to the problem down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> To bring the public with us, we have to continuously emphasise the extent of the problem and use the dreadful weather events which occur from time to time to emphasise why it is so important that we make a huge jump in tackling climate change and to ensure the temperature of the world will not increase by more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. If we use the opportunities which, unfortunately, are going to arise with increasing frequency, it may help to get the public to understand and us to accept that we must change the way we do things. However, it is important that this be done not just in Ireland but elsewhere also. In that regard, a useful step was taken in the discussions between the United States and China, the two countries which produce the most carbon. What they have agreed is in no way adequate, but it is important that they have begun to make that step and I hope there will be further steps down the track, to be taken as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The other aspect which might help people to accept the great need for change is that climate change problems also provide new economic opportunities, for example, in solar or wind energy production. This, however, will require investment. New doors will be opened and people will see the benefits. However, there is no question that if we do not address these issues urgently, we will increasingly be in serious trouble, with low-lying communities in danger of being flooded, to name but one of the huge problems we face. </p>
          <p eId="para_278"> On the report and the Bill, I realise - the Minister of State, Deputy Áodhan Ó Ríordáin, made this clear - that there is a gap between what the Bill offers and what the report advocated. When we come to discuss the Bill, it will be our duty to try to ensure we have maximum effect in bringing us towards a more carbon neutral country and world. I will go into this matter in more detail at that stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Given that Third World communities are, in a sense, on the front line in dealing with the adverse effects of climate change, it is right that there be a transfer to them to assist them in deal with their difficulties. It is very important to mention a couple of recommendations made in the report. It is important that we try to include in the Bill some definition of what we mean by low carbon emissions and specific targets to be met. It should also be emphasised that the climate council is independent and can come to its own conclusions. I welcome the five-year mitigation programme because this issue needs to be looked at on a regular basis for many years. I will come back to it when the Bill is being discussed. </p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I thank the Minister of State, the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Michael McCarthy, and committee members for the work they have done on this issue. As we can see, there will be difficulties. There are, for example, problems in trying to install wind turbines around the country. There will also be difficulties in trying to bring forward low carbon emission energy projects, for example, so as not to tread too much on the toes of local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">It is important that we focus on the long-term necessity of addressing this major problem which stares us in the face.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">It is very timely that we debate the report in the week in which the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill was, finally, published. It gives the House a chance to see the weight of such committee reports and the bearing they have on policy making. It is a coincidence that they both happened this week because this was due to be debated in December but was postponed because the Friday sitting was used for Government business. Ironically, the same week the heads of the legislation were published in 2013, we debated my energy security and climate change Bill, which the Government did not accept. I did not envisage it would take so long to get even this far.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I thank Professor John Sweeney, who, with the committee, put much effort into the preparation of the report. I thank all those who came before the committee and contributed. There were some very interesting contributions that many of us felt would be valuable when the time came to debate the legislation. Many of us thought the report should have gone much further and should have made very specific recommendations, however we went with a balanced report because we thought it would increase the chance that most of the recommendations would be included in the legislation. Unfortunately, some of the key issues it highlighted have not found their way into the legislation. The Bill got more scrutiny than most legislation. This is the seventh such Bill that has been presented in the past ten years, including my Bill in 2013 and two by the Government, including this one. We have a history of proposing legislation on this without passing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The committee engaged in two weeks of intensive deliberations across the sectors. Representatives of the agriculture sector made some very interesting contributions, and agriculture will present us with the most difficulties in making sectoral plans. I was very impressed with the BirdWatch Ireland representatives who talked to us about the carbon sink the bogs could provide. Given that the hearings were broad ranging, it is disappointing that some of the conclusions did not find their way into the legislation. The overwhelming weight of witness opinion favoured legally binding emissions reduction targets. This was reflected in the definition on page 17 of the report. The Minister is wrong; a definition of the criteria was included in the report, which specified:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_285">(1) Near zero emissions for 2050 in the Energy, Buildings and Transport Sectors;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_286">(2) Carbon neutrality in the Agricultural sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The report stated very clearly:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_288">Since the objective of the legislation is ultimately to change behaviour and facilitate the achievement of national goals in respect of climate change mitigation, a measure of what the ultimate effort entails is necessary. Only by having a specific objective can indicators of progress be monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> The Bill contains no such language and no specific objectives other than those of our EU and international commitments. It contains no sector-specific targets or interim targets. If we do not have a balance in our sectoral plans, one sector will have to compensate for another sector that does not contribute an equal share. For example, we could have to counter what we do not do in agriculture with a major investment in mitigating the damage done by the transport sector, for example by delivering a very efficient public transport system. We could have to consider the retrofitting of people's homes. An initiative at European level would be needed to deliver on some of these initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The report was very prescriptive on individual sectors, recommending a target of carbon neutrality in agriculture by 2050 with interim report targets in 2020, 2030 and 2040. Under this Bill, I can conceive of no possible way this goal can be achieved, especially given the intensive production targets envisaged in Food Harvest 2020. I would like to be proven wrong on this. No thought has been given to the specific recommendation that the Government encourage sustainable forms of agriculture by investigating an agricultural emissions trading scheme at EU level. While perhaps this is not directly for this legislation, a wider debate and initiative could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The report recommended incorporating the principles of climate justice into domestic legislation. Those least well equipped to handle climate change will be most affected by it in Bangladesh, southern Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. We have an international obligation. The Government has, again, ignored this recommendation and is determined to do as little as possible on climate justice by declining to sign up to the international Green Climate Fund, which is designed to help the poorest and most disadvantaged to make the changes necessary to reduce emissions. Most industrialised countries are the ones which have caused the most damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The committee’s report refers to the expert advisory body. There was a very strong consensus and a push on the part of the Labour Party that this body be an independent body, and it is critical. Deputy Ciarán Lynch, or possibly the Minister of State himself, constantly made the point that it should be along the lines of the Fiscal Advisory Council. However, the legislation has dropped this recommendation. Energy security came up several times during the debate. It is vital that we have fossil fuel reduction targets. We are very dependent on fossil fuel imports, with more than 90% of our fuel imported and only 80 days of reserves. We spend approximately €8 billion per year on importing oil and gas.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> At no point in the process of the preparation of national and sectoral plans did the urgency of action seem to dawn on the Government. This lazy, irresponsible approach has been reflected again in the inclusion of an incredibly long wait, until 2017. It is not 12 months but 24 months. The Government is passing the responsibility on to the next Government. It should be heavily criticised for this aspect alone. The more we push it out to the future, the more we put the obligation onto future generations who will not only pick up the pieces of the financial crash but also the tab for the environmental damage of previous generations and today's. We have a responsibility into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The EPA has estimated that starting in 2016, our non-ETS emissions will be at such a level as to make it impossible to achieve the 2020 targets. These are the people who will monitor the situation and have oversight of it. Therefore, we should pay attention to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Let us look briefly at the initiatives being taken by the Government, even before we come to this legislation. We collect a carbon tax, but this is not a real carbon tax, as it is not spent on initiatives that will produce a change in behaviour. In regard to public transport, we need a fiscal expansion that recognises the investment coming from both domestic and European funds if we are to be serious about achieving targets. In regard to the Aarhus Convention, it must mean something, rather than the notion that consultation is some sort of box ticking exercise. We must deliver on the Aarhus Convention and make it meaningful to communities. The failure in this regard is the reason we are at war over different types of production of renewable energy.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015, which was published last Monday, is a serious disappointment. It is a further disappointment that much of the work done by the committee, which went out of its way not to be impractical, has been undermined. The Bill published last Monday is repetitiously vague throughout. At times the repetition looks as if it is a printing error, as the same statements are printed over and over again. Worst of all, the Government has kicked the can down the road to the next Government, by extending the deadline for the next climate plan to 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> The Taoiseach made himself clear on the issue on Tuesday evening, when he spoke about Ireland being in a position to negotiate with the EU about the targets. The only issue we should be negotiating on is the possibility of achieving better targets sooner. We, the people and the world cannot sit around waiting on shortsighted, pro-business, GDP-obsessed neoliberals to play a game of musical chairs to determine which cabal of Ministers will finally get saddled with the difficult job of having to do something about tackling climate change. The stakes are too high and the problems too deep and widespread. The biggest problem is the Government's cosy ties with big business and the capitalist elite. The current Government has never expressed concern about the fact that under current licensing terms, the Irish State retains a 0% royalty share in any oil or gas found in the Shell Corrib project.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> According to a 2007 study commissioned by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Ireland offers one of the lowest government takes in the world. What kind of lobbying got us into that position? The recently passed lobbying Bill ensures that many people will still get cosy jobs in the industries the Government is supposed to be regulating and that the conversations that go on between the economic players, politicians and civil servants can remain as secretive as the Government pleases. We need a monumental ideological shift to make this Bill work, and a neoliberal government, whether the current one or the next, will not facilitate it. The interests of the markets, bankers and multinational corporations remain paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> Let me explain the reality of the situation the Government is steadily ignoring by quoting from Naomi Klein's new book, <i>This Changes Everything. </i>Every Member should read this all-encompassing book. It does not treat climate change in isolation, but covers almost every issue we discuss here and every dimension of how society is organised. Sooner or later, we will have to cop on to ourselves. She states: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_300">In 2011 the London based Carbon Tracker Initiative conducted a study that added together the reserves claimed by all the fossil fuel companies, private and state-owned. It found that the oil, gas and coal to which these players had already laid claim - deposits they have on their books and which were already making money for shareholders - represented 2,795 gigatons of carbon (a gigaton is 1 billion metric tons). That's a very big problem because we know roughly how much carbon can be burned between now and 2050 and still leave us a solid chance (roughly 80 per cent) of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius. According to one highly credible study, that amount of carbon is 565 gigatons between 2011 and 2049. And as Bill McKibben points out, "the thing to notice is, 2,795 is five times 565. It's not even close." He adds: "What those numbers mean is quite simple. This industry has announced, in filings to the SEC and in promises to shareholders, that they're determined to burn five times more fossil fuel than the planet's atmosphere can begin to absorb.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Will the Minister of State please tell the House what proposal there is in this Bill, or in the Government's imagination, even to begin to deal with this problem? I refer to the problem of the unfettered power of the fossil fuel companies to destroy any chance of reaching the targets alluded to in the Bill. Why is the Corrib project even going ahead? Why is the Government even entertaining the idea of fracking in Ireland? Does it have, as is happening in the UK, employees of fossil fuel companies placed within government to work on energy issues free of charge? Why has it refused to tackle in the lobbying Bill, the revolving door cancer within politics which should simply be called "jobs in lieu of bribes"? Why do we allow, aside from the dreadful fact that we are promoting terrorism, the planes of one of the biggest polluters on the planet, the US military, to pass through Shannon Airport on a daily basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Many serious steps need to be taken, but the first should be a serious "polluter pays" tax regime. Professor Stephen W. Pacala of the Princeton Environmental Institute has estimated that the top 500 million richest people on earth are responsible for over half of the world's carbon emissions while 3 billion of the poorest people emit essentially nothing. Overpopulation is not the problem. Rich people being allowing to treat the earth like a garbage dump is the main problem. A series of progressive carbon taxes, such as a millionaire's or a higher billionaire's tax and severe punitive measures for multinational corporations must be implemented in order for us to reach the needed targets. Only the rich enjoy the benefits of their massive incomes. Trickle down economics is a myth and the richest 1% will own half the world's wealth by next year. The deprivation rate in Ireland has risen to 31.5%, up from 27% last year. Taxes that are progressive and fair to begin with are now even fairer by default. A carbon tax is a progressive tax and the revenues collected can be put to use in investment in a carbon free Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> A perfect illustration of how the Government's lack of concern for the environment and how incapable it is of doing anything about it arose late last year with the publication of the Government's strategic blueprint for investing in transport. An Taisce said that the policy proposed in the document: "reflects either ignorance of, or indifference to, the global scientific consensus on climate, the Copenhagen Accord, and the Irish Government commitment to a low-carbon future by 2050." The document fails to assess the fuel source and emission impact of existing and future transport infrastructure or the need to protect coastal and rail infrastructure from storms. Vitally, the Government has no place for rail transport in its future transport plans. It goes as far as to argue that: "Unlike car ownership and use, public transport usage is generally adversely impacted by rising incomes." I am not entirely sure what it means by this poorly phrased argument, but it seems that the Government's main reason for not investing in the universally accepted eco-friendly mode of transport is that when everyone is so rich from all the austerity it has imposed on them, they will be too affluent to take the train. The argument is so weak it gives the lie to what is really going on. The National Roads Authority has become a monster and a self-sustaining industry that is too big to challenge and, seemingly, too big to fail. The NRA could have been abolished in 2008 or 2009, but the decision was not taken to do that. Now it has grown too big and has got its tentacles into too many areas, making it impossible to do away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The policies we need, to quote Naomi Klein:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_305">need to be fair, so that the people already struggling to cover the basics are not being asked to make additional sacrifices to offset the excessive consumption of the rich. That means cheap public transit and clean light rail accessible to all; affordable, energy efficient housing along those transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren't asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste they produce, and to radically reduce built-in redundancies and obsolescences.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Instead, the Government is dismantling and letting rail infrastructure rot, while overcharging for a less frequent and under-funded service. We now have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looking at plans to abolish free travel passes for spouses and companions of the elderly. This is not the way forward. Neoliberal conservatives are not capable of providing Ireland with security against climate change. The interests of the polluters have been served for far too long.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_307">I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on this most important Bill, the Climate Action and Low Carbon (Development) Bill 2013. The Bill continues to lack real teeth, with no clear targets being set. The exhaustive hearings of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and its subsequent recommendations on which there was consensus have effectively been ignored by the Government. The Bill marks a regressive move back from the ambitious framework of targets to 2050 included in previous legislation, including Fianna Fáil's Bill in 2010, the all-party 2010 Bill and the Labour Party's 2009 Bill. It will delay action on the issue of climate change for a further two years as the Government kicks the can down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is following hard in the footsteps of the previous Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, in his failure to include a strategic target to be met by 2050. This exposes his failure to rise to the pressing challenge posed by climate change. Removing the responsibility for setting targets and leaving it to the European Union is an abrogation of duty. For the Labour Party, it is yet another broken promise as it fails to legislate for the goals included in its own legislation in 2009. Instead, it has settled for flawed and emasculated legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Environmental groups roundly criticised the heads of the Bill for their lack of vision in setting out a meaningful strategic framework to address the issue of climate change. The Bill does not include the Government's own definition of "low carbon"; does not guarantee the independence of the climate advisory council and does not include the principle of climate justice. The failure to include specific targets to be met by 2050 will give rise to sectoral interests potentially hijacking the process and depriving the Bill of its long-term impact in shaping policy formation. Attaching targets linked with EU and international agreements alone is a cop-out. This was the Labour Party's position before it performed a U-turn on the issue on entering government.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The idea of having an expert advisory council is welcome, but the council must be given real resources and clear powers if it is to have a real impact on climate change policy. In the Bill it lacks real independence. The Oireachtas must debate its advice and reports and, unlike what is proposed in the Bill, the Government must consult it when developing a carbon strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> The Government has delayed the adoption of a national mitigation plan, with sectoral policy measures, by at least another two years. Ireland's last emissions reduction plan expired at the end of 2012, just before our challenging 2020 EU targets came into force. The Government promised a new plan by early 2014. In April 2014 the previous Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, drafted a Bill which mandated that there be an action plan within 12 months of the climate law coming into force. The Bill gives the Government two years from enactment to come up with actual measures to reduce emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The measure on the annual transition report is welcome and the report should be fully debated in the Oireachtas in holding the Government to account on its climate change strategy. A rigorous accountability system needs to be put in place to ensure public bodies will be the drivers of reform on climate change and play a leading role in innovating and implementing the Government's strategy. Specific public body climate change reports should be developed. This has to be driven at local government level also.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The principle of climate justice has been entirely ignored in the Bill. The Government has voiced support for the principle at the United Nations and co-hosted a conference on the issue, with Mrs. Mary Robinson, during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. Was this simply a cynical exercise on its part?</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Fianna Fáil is committed to having an ambitious environmental programme which includes tackling climate change. We published the Climate Change Response Bill 2010 on 23 December 2010 which completed First Stage in the Seanad before the Dáil was dissolved. It set out Fianna Fáil's commitment to legislating for a process that would allow us to plan for greenhouse emissions reductions and adaptation to climate change. Fianna Fáil believes this must be done in a way that safeguards economic development and competitiveness. Ireland's strategy should be consistent with EU targets and we have consistently supported the international process under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. A major change in our approach to climate change policy should be a new national priority, as we are no longer solely focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While such reductions are important indicators of progress, we must also have a longer term and wider vision for creating a prosperous and sustainable Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The climate change Bill should enable us to pursue the objective of having a smart economy which is highly productive, competitive, resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable. We support the broad thrust of the findings of and recommendations made in the NESC's report. Five guiding principles for action on climate change should underpin Ireland's strategy to become a carbon-neutral society. These are economic prosperity, recovery and social development; incremental and permanent decarbonisation; responsibility, integrity and leadership; reform of public institutions and governance; and societal engagement. The fifth report of the International Panel on Climate Change revealed the massive scale of the challenge facing the world. It is a serious wake-up call in terms of the need to recognise the overwhelming scientific evidence and the impact climate change will have. It must give fresh impetus to the need for an international climate change framework to be agreed in Paris by the end of 2015 following the failure of the talks in Copenhagen. The European Union and within that framework the Irish Government have to take the lead in these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the report and the fact that we have the Bill which has been long awaited. I thought it was going to be a little like Johnny Logan's song, "What's Another Year?" I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Áodhán Ó Ríordáin, is into music. We have been waiting for the Bill a long time. I introduced a Bill over one year ago which reflected Sinn Féin's position on the issue of climate change. It dealt with the crucial issues of meeting targets, incrementally in a measured way, holding successive Governments to account and, particularly, avoiding carbon cliffs. We are at a carbon cliff because we are behind the curve in dealing with these issues. We are not where we should be, even in terms of meeting our 2020 targets. There are huge concerns about how we should move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> The national climate change strategy expired in 2012 and what the Bill proposes is, unfortunately, totally inadequate to follow on from it. There is no excuse for this, especially in the light of the fact that the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht - an all-party committee - put forward proposals in its 2013 report. I hope that as the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage, we can work in the same spirit. The previous Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, gave the impression that what we had set out in our report which attracted 600 submissions would be considered favourably. Unfortunately, many of our recommendations were ignored or have been diluted. I know that the Minister of State is here on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and has put his best foot forward in terms of outlining the Labour Party's position. I can assure him, however, that the Bill is a long way from what that party's position used to be on climate change. </p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The report of the joint committee and the Bill are two very different documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The possible courses of action set out in each are very different. Despite consultation and the committee's report, the former Minister revised the heads of the Bill, which was published in April 2014, and again ignored the advice and recommendations of the committee. It is regrettable that happened. </p>
          <p eId="para_320"> We are all concerned about climate change. Very few people now seriously doubt whether it is happening. Our weather and atmosphere are being turbo-charged by emissions. Where extreme weather events used to happen once in a lifetime, in Ireland we now experience them every year. Deputy O'Dowd said humans do not deal with problems that do not seem to be immediate to them. We have grown accustomed to the habit of saying that problems are for somebody else to solve. All parties in the Dáil share the concern that we cannot offload these problems to somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I have heard the argument put forward that we are such a small country it does not matter what we do, and it is up to China, the United States and Russia to address the issue. It is not, because it is affecting us. It affected Ireland last January and February when there were storms as a result of rising sea levels and tides which were brought about by global warming. We saw the effects on the south and west coasts. We have to deal with the issue and have a moral obligation to do so. Unfortunately, I can see Commissioner Phil Hogan's fingerprints all over the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Some of the points we raised and possible courses of action we pointed out have been taken, and I welcome the fact that there will be five-year rather than seven-year plans. The committee proposed other progressives measures, which are included in the Bill. One of the major gaps is the reference to low carbon emissions and the absence of that definition. The Government will say it was the policy position put forward in April 2012, but it is not in the Bill. The starting point has to be a definition of what is meant by the term "low-carbon society". We must also define what we mean by the term "low-carbon".</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Ministers have confidently predicted that Ireland will pass EU targets. I recall the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, when he held the energy brief, justifying plans to build large wind farm projects in the midlands to export energy on that basis. I recall that he stated Ireland would be in a position to export electricity created from renewable targets because we would have surpassed our targets for electricity generation from renewables. However, that implies that this would have been part of meeting or overtaking the EU targets on carbon emissions, if renewables were gradually but progressively replacing fossils fuels as a source of energy. </p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Does the absence of targets in the Bill indicate that such confidence has evaporated? We know the wind farm projects have taken a turn for the worse. Have the Government and relevant Ministers with responsibility for these matters revisited that? Do they know where matters stand in that regard? Perhaps the Minister of State might inform us as to whether he believes this country will meet the targets for renewable energy generation. If not, perhaps he can explain why all of that was not factored in when targets for the reduction in emissions were set, something which could have been included in the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_325"> All of this highlights the total absence of a guiding strategy for energy, which is intimately tied to the reduction in carbon emissions. The only option in an economy and society such as ours is to replace our overwhelming dependency on imported fossil fuels, which are the source of such emissions, with renewable and native sources of fuel. The country is unique in terms of geography, in particular in the European context, with regard to the potential for generating energy from renewable sources. Wind has occupied the main focus to date, which is not correct as one can only do so much with wind energy. The grid can only take so much energy from wind at a particular time during peaks of high wind. We have not fully considered the potential of the untapped energy from wave and tidal sources. That must be done. We are trying to play catch-up. It is directly linked to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
          <p eId="para_326"> The Bill as it stands is not fit-for-purpose without having specific targets to be achieved within specific timeframes, such as 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. We need to have our own targets, rather than those which are handed to us by international bodies or the EU. We are dodging the issue by not setting out clear targets. I hope there can be all-party co-operation on improving the Bill because it is very much a Fine Gael, as opposed to a Labour Party, Bill. A number of areas need to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The definition of a "low-carbon economy or society" needs to be addressed. Our party feels very strongly about sectoral targets because there will be a row between different sectors. The parcel will be passed around but this is not a parcel which can be passed around. Climate change is happening here and now, and we have to deal with it now. While I welcome the fact that the national plan is now a five-year, rather than a seven-year, plan, we have questions about the expert advisory council. It is very important to have it but the committee was very clear in setting out how it should be constituted and operate independently, which is very important. </p>
          <p eId="para_328"> We must take climate justice into consideration. The Bill is weak, has a number of gaps and has moved a long way from the possible courses of action on some issues which the committee report set out. I will table amendments on behalf of Sinn Féin in that regard. It is an issue with which we must deal. </p>
          <p eId="para_329"> There is a very conservative, Tea Party and republican school of thought in the United States, some places in Europe, Ireland and the Chamber to the effect that we should not talk about climate change because we cannot afford to do so. We cannot afford not to talk about and deal with it. As a state, we should embrace a low carbon economy in terms of economic development. We should become a leader in green technology and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We should use this challenge as a plus for our food, tourism and technology industries, and turn it to our advantage. I hope we can do that. I look forward to debating the Bill and making amendments to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">One of the fundamental reasons that politics is widely discredited in the eyes of large numbers of people is because in almost every area, rather than listen to the people who work in particular sectors or industries - those who are passionate about things or the communities affected - and taking a lead from and involving them in making important decisions, we instead listen to a tiny number of people who just see these areas of endeavour or sectors as an opportunity to make money.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We always listen to the minority who see our planet and resources as an opportunity to make money and never listen to the people who care passionately about these things for themselves, to those who are affected directly or to those who work in these areas. At the bottom of most of the problems we face in this country and internationally is that folly of getting things completely the wrong way around and upside down in terms of how we deal with problems, set objectives and chart a way for our society. As Deputy Wallace alluded to, it is the reason we have economic crises which affect everybody, even that tiny minority who control all the wealth and have all the influence at government tables.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> If one only listens to a tiny group of the wealthiest people and big business interests, one is guaranteed to get it wrong. What is good for a small minority, or what it thinks is good for it, runs counter to what is good for the rest of society, ultimately backfires even on them and leads us into the sort of catastrophic crises we are seeing. That is a generally true statement and there is no clearer example of how we are getting things wrong in that way than the issue of climate change. It is clear in the debate around the Bill and the response of the Government in dealing with the issue that it is engaged in a classic example of doing things completely the wrong way. People who care about these issues are asked for their views in submissions and 90% of them say we need binding targets. They submit that the issue is so serious that binding targets are required to deal with it. The matter gets to an Oireachtas committee and the views of the public, those who care, and the stakeholders are diluted. The committee says we cannot have binding targets as that is a bit extreme. Perhaps, it says, we can have a definition of low carbon so that at least we have some sort of roadmap to reducing carbon emissions and meeting international targets. It goes further up the line and all of that is ignored. The view of the 90% is ignored and the slightly watered down version of the Oireachtas committee is ignored. Instead, the Government listens to the big agriculture lobby. I stress that it is big agriculture. It sees binding targets as likely to infringe on its short-term - I stress "short-term" - view of making profit.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I have read what lots of other people have said and I listened to what the Minister has said. That can be the only explanation for the failure of the Government to include binding targets or even a definition of low carbon. It is the only explanation I can find for the fact that it has rejected the recommendation to have a fully independent advisory body on the setting out of plans and instead to have that body dominated by senior officials from State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Why do we not listen and why are we diluting demands for specific and concrete action on what is a national and global emergency? Why do we shy away from that? Why do we refuse to listen? It is because we are not listening to those people to whom we should be and are instead listening to a minority set of interests. In the end, it is self-defeating for them. As we face the prospect of significant parts of the landmass of Ireland literally sinking under water and as we see the impact of flooding, including its devastating impact on agriculture, it is short-sighted and self-defeating from every point of view, including that of agriculture itself, to fail to understand that we need binding targets. We must be serious and concrete about moving to a low-carbon economy and meeting our international targets in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> In my last few minutes, I will set out a specific example at a sectoral level of our endemic attitude to these matters. I refer to forestry, an area about which I have spoken a great deal in the House. Forestry is something we know is a carbon sink. We know what the mitigating effects on carbon emissions of planting a particular number of trees are. There is also a positive spin-off of significant employment. We had targets, which we have consistently failed to meet, to plant 25,000 hectares of forestry by 2000 and 20,000 hectares per year until 2030 to increase significantly our forest cover and approach something like the average European level. We are now far below that average. Average cover in Europe is approximately 30% to 35% but it is 11% in Ireland. We set targets to do something about it but have consistently failed to meet them in an area which would contribute significantly to addressing climate change while creating employment. It would be a win-win, but we do not do it. When the Forestry Bill came before the House, I suggested to the Minister that we should have binding targets but was told we could not. My amendments were ruled out of order because they would have incurred a charge on the Exchequer, but the Minister could have included them.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Why does the Government not include these targets? Why does it not want to do so? I got the same stuff when we discussed this in committee about the potential consequences for agriculture and the need to look at land use. The short-term interests of one sector prevents action on something that will affect our entire society and our entire planet. It is short-sighted to respond to these things in this way. I do not understand it except to conclude that the Government and its Departments are held hostage by minority interests which will, in the end, drive this planet over the edge just as in recent years they have driven the global economy over the edge. They do not have the interests of society, our planet and our natural resources as a whole at heart; rather they have a short-term interest in profit and wealth. In diluting the demands of environmentalists and others to include specific targets, the Government has sadly shown which side it is on in this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">I probably cannot compete with Deputy Boyd Barrett's eloquence. I pay tribute to the quality of the submissions to the committee and to the Chairman who did an exceptionally good job to ensure everybody had a chance to contribute. It was a very warm summer when we were in the committee room Friday after Friday, week after week going through every sector and listening to them very carefully. Regardless of their sectoral interests they had a shared common aim and concern. I pay tribute to the committee, the staff, the Senators and the Deputies who gave of their time so freely. I also pay tribute to the community groups, BirdWatch Ireland, the agricultural sector and all of the organisations who made very thoughtful and useful contributions which form a body of work which will continue to be referenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> When Deputy Boyd Barrett was making his contribution BirdWatch Ireland popped into my mind. The quality of its contribution was particularly excellent and much thought was put into it. I remember seeing BirdWatch Ireland on the witness list and wondering whether it would consider only a very tiny area. It touched upon many of the issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, including the hundreds of thousands of trees we need to plant throughout the countryside. It mentioned ill-advised planting and the damage to our rivers through acidification. Sometimes people throw out simplistic and populist solutions. Everybody is in favour of planting trees but not everybody is in favour of planting trees on the bogs which stretch throughout the country. It is an enormous carbon sink. One could plant hundreds of thousands of trees, but it would not match the carbon sink of one bog and the value it contributes to the climate and our biodiversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I could touch on the many very well thought-out contributions made to the committee. Deputy Stanley, who has left the Chamber, was here for most of the morning. He spent hour after hour in the committee room. Some people continue to perceive the expert advisory council as lacking independence in its advice-giving functions but this is a double-edged sword. Nobody would thank us for an expert advisory group which is too far removed from the real world but nobody in the Government wants the expert advisory group to be a lap-dog of the Government. They want well thought-out and well-researched advice. There is a need for a level of expertise on the council. As the member of the committee who proposed the expert advisory committee, I can inform the House it is in some ways modelled on the Fiscal Advisory Council. As a member of the Government I am anxious to ensure the expert advisory group has the expertise required to provide advice, and that its membership includes people with particular agricultural, industrial and carbon measurement expertise so the advice will be truly valued. The Minister of the day will have to explain if he or she does not take its advice. My intention as a public representative, member of the Government and Minister of State is that the advisory body will be expert and independent. I hope to be here for many years to ensure I can hold the expert advisory group to these high ideals.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Many fine contributions have been made and many included references to the hard numbers for migration targets. I probably had the same view, and I listened to the advice of people with expertise in the area. It was much discussed. Migration targets will be agreed by all member states of the European Union, including Ireland, on an incremental basis over the coming decades. The report states these will be transcribed into legislation and I very much support this idea. There is no point in us setting hard figures if we find they are below what is negotiated in the EU as they would immediately be redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> As I walked into the Chamber, Deputy Boyd Barrett was stating the Government had taken on tiny minorities in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is an extremely important industry and it employs hundreds of thousands of people. We must ensure these people do not lose their jobs and we must give equal importance to ensuring we do the climate as little damage as possible, and possibly no damage. The agricultural sector was equally anxious to examine areas in its industries with a view to becoming a low carbon part of the economy. We must not work with a tiny sector of the agricultural community but with the hundreds of thousands of people employed in it and ensure we can reduce carbon emissions while ensuring we maintain employment. Yesterday I travelled through east Clare. Given the number of people involved in agriculture there, it is not a tiny sector. It is important to local shops, veterinarians, pubs and shops. Without a thriving agricultural sector we would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> What I believe is important is the climate we leave to our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The independent expert advisory council will play a significant role in the coming years. A recommendation in the report, which I believe will be accepted by the Government, is that the Minister makes an annual report to the House. This means we will discuss climate change here on an annual basis so it will not slip off the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> On the previous Government, I will pay tribute to the Green Party which had it as a priority to bring forward a climate change Bill. I apologise if I misrepresent its Members in stating it was reported that they stayed in government to have a climate action and low-carbon development Bill enacted. Unfortunately, their partners in government blocked that and the Bill was watered down to such an extent that it stated that one could not challenge it in a judicial system. Such language is not in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015, which is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I am happy, as a member of the Government, an elected Deputy in this House and a former member of the committee Deputy McCarthy chairs, to say that we have a good report a number of elements of which the Government has taken on board, but for the first time since the foundation of the State we will pass a Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill and place it on the Statute Book to be built on for decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> We will look back in five or six years time, taking out the noise. I understand Deputy Boyd Barrett must portray everything the Government does as being wrong or not good enough, that it will damage hundreds of thousands of people and disaster will unfold, but this is an incremental improvement. I think it is groundbreaking and it will be improved on in future years and decades. It will be remarked upon that the Labour Party and Fine Gael in government introduced a climate action and low carbon development Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I apologise to the Acting Chairman, Deputy Tuffy, and thank her for her indulgence in letting me run over.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy<recordedTime time="2015-01-23T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_353">I thank all those who made valuable contributions here this afternoon, including the Ministers of State, Deputies Ó Ríordáin and Kevin Humphreys. I thank them for the insightful contributions. Indeed, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, before he was a Minister of State, was a member of the committee and worked hard in the background, along with myself and others, to bring about the report. We spent many long days, in committee and elsewhere, meeting the different stakeholders and interest groups to bring about this important piece of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> As I have stated earlier, this is one of the key issues facing the world today and it is important that we formulate the necessary policy and legislation to help Ireland move to a low carbon and environmentally sustainable economy and society. This report represents a culmination of lengthy and wide-ranging consultations on climate legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> As a committee, we were concerned about Ireland's ability to meet its targets and the direct economic cost of not doing so. That is why we listened carefully to the evidence presented to us and why we drew the Minister's attention specifically to the ideas and suggestions put forward by witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I can safely say that the report provides a sound basis for ensuring that we strike the right balance between ambition and practicality. It contains both realistic and practical recommendations ensuring timely and effective implementation on our ambitious climate change policies. The report aims to copperfasten and streamline existing administrative work on reaching our mitigation targets in a way that is coherent across the whole of Government and transparent for all to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I would encourage the Minister to consider the appropriateness of each and all of the recommendations and to include those which he believes are beneficial in the next Stage of the Bill. I hope the Minister is favourably disposed to looking at the constructive and well thought-out amendments that no doubt will be put forward by Members who spoke here this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I can assure everyone here today, having heard all the evidence and having heard the contributions of various Members, that there will be no shortage of proposed amendments to the Bill when we reach Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> One of the issues I want to touch on is this one about there being no targets. This is untrue. If people took the time to go to the committee hearings while they were going on, if they took the time to read the submissions or, better still, if they took the time to read the report, they would know this. Ireland is already subject to legally binding mitigation targets up to the year 2020 as part of the European Union legislation, and further mitigation targets up to 2030 are currently being negotiated. This process of target setting under the auspices of the EU will likely continue up to the year 2050. Accordingly, providing targets in the report would be both redundant and would potentially interfere with the binding targets set under European Union legislation by which we are legally bound. Moreover, our long-term vision for targets for low carbon transition has already been set out in the Government-approved national climate policy position of April 2014. In other words, there is no need to include further targets in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> There was a comment, by Deputy Kirk, that we are kicking the can down the road. There is no kicking of the can down the road. The recently launched Bill will be one of the most important Bills to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas, this year and for years to come. It will make Ireland a progressive minority in the European Union because Ireland will be one of five member states to introduce climate change legislation. Only four other EU member states have adopted climate change legislation so far. Ireland will be one of the first EU countries to put a legal obligation on its Government to develop policies to plan for existing and future climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Over the past couple of years, but particularly during the process of compiling the report when the committee held public hearings, I was struck by the contributions of Deputies Catherine Murphy and Stanley. They attended all of the meetings, of which there were many on non-sitting days during a fine summer in the basement of Leinster House - I could think of many other places to be. Theirs were thought-out contributions. We met a considerable variety of NGOs, academics, scientists, employers' bodies, the IFA and other interest groups, and they all made well-researched, thorough, insightful and intelligent contributions to our proceedings. Information was gathered through the public hearings and the many written submissions that we received. I was looking through them as some of the contributions were being made. We had contributions from: Professor Peadar Kirby from University of Limerick, UL, Dr. Brian Ó Gallachóir, University College Cork, UCC, and the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change, that is, Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna, Diageo, KPMG, NTR, Siemens, Sodexo and Vodafone. We also had contributions from many private individuals, and from Irish Dairy Industries, Food and Drink Industries, Meat Industry Ireland, Trócaire, Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, BirdWatch Ireland, Stop Climate Chaos, the Electricity Association of Ireland, the Environmental Pillar, An Taisce, Professor Ray Bates from National University of Ireland, NUI, Dublin, Friends of the Earth and Ceartas – Irish Lawyers for Human Rights and the Institute for International and European Affairs. At all of those different meetings, these witnesses came in and laid out their stall, and they took the time to research the matter and to make those contributions. Those who did not get a chance to do so made submissions online.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> There were a couple of Members here who read scripts. Deputy Kirk read a script and so did Deputy Wallace. It is a pity they did not take the time to come down to the basement when we were holding those public hearings to make their submissions. That is the difficulty of reading out a script. Sometimes one will read it out blindly. That is what points to the contrast in the contributions this morning made by members of the committee who took the time to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I would also say to those who have criticised or singled out any particular organisation which made contributions to take the time to read its submission, read the Official Report of the committee - it is all online, transparent and in black and white - and then go to the report. Clearly, some never read or saw the report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the 31st Dáil and 24th Seanad, "Report on the Outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2013", of November 2013. It is worth reading. Those who will take the time to do that would have a more informed and better contribution, and have a better basis on which to make that contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I thank all of those who contributed to a fine volume of work. In the coming weeks, the committee will spend more hours down in the basement of Leinster House amending that legislation as its members see fit. I hope that the political will that has inspired this report will be reflected there by Government. I hope the Minister will be favourably disposed to looking at amendments from those who have genuine concerns on this Bill which is reflected in their attendance at committees and their contributions to the issue, and not in coming in here criticising for criticism's sake.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> As I stated in my earlier contribution, this commitment was in the Labour Party manifesto. This commitment found its way into the programme for Government. It is difficult to take criticism from a member of a party that did not bother its behind to do anything about it in four years of Government, despite the junior party bleating continually about climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">People who supported that Administration are in no position to criticise either the report or the climate legislation. This is a red letter day for climate action in this country. It deserves to be treated with the integrity and the diligence that has been reflected by the vast majority of those who made the time to attend, to contribute and to develop this fine volume of work. I look forward to the next few weeks. I want to express my sincere appreciation to those who made constructive contributions on the subject, not just this afternoon, but for the last two or three years. I advise the Johnny-come-latelies, those who have only just discovered there is climate change when they saw the list of legislation published for this term, that it is worth taking an informed view on this important topic.</p>
