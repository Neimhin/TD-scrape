            <p eId="para_3">I ask the Minister of State to listen carefully and to take note. I await his answer with interest. I hope we see some positive news in it but even if we do not, the crucial thing is that this message is relayed back to the Department, the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Simon Harris. Carrigaline, for those familiar with it, is a large town of some 15,000 people. It has grown rapidly. As recently as 1961, there were fewer than a thousand people in the town. It is a commuter town, the population of which has multiplied in the last decade or two because of its proximity to Cork city and the many positive things about the town. It has a lot of employment, many amenities and a strong sense of community. With that growth, investment in resources has not followed adequately. There have been some improvements. We have seen the development of the Carrigaline Lions Youth Centre and some improvements to the roads and in public transport. In one particular area, at least, resources have not adequately followed. Carrigaline is still dealing with crime prevention and Garda numbers that reflect the time when the town was much smaller. About two years ago, I did an analysis which found that of all the towns with a population of more than 10,000, Carrigaline had the fourth lowest number of gardaí. Of the remaining three towns, two were in close proximity to each other, namely, Celbridge and Leixlip. At present, there are 21 gardaí in Carrigaline, three sergeants and 18 gardaí. That is fewer than in summer 2020 when there were 23. If we break that figure down and take away the three sergeants, the warrants and firearms officer, the community gardaí and detectives, we are down to 12 or 13 gardai who are dedicated on a full-time basis to responding to incidents and patrolling the streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Carrigaline has a very young population, with 5,000 people or one in three of the population under the age of 18. It is important that we plan for the future and ensure the town has the resources it needs. Unfortunately, I have been asked to raise this matter by countless people in the community in recent weeks because of a number of very worrying incidents. In late December, there was a very serious assault which sadly led to the death of Mr. Matt O'Neill. I send my condolences to his family. Subsequently, in January, a teenager was stabbed and injured. Unfortunately, we have seen a number of these incidents over the last couple of years. It is shocking and upsetting to people in the town. Carrigaline is a very positive town with a fantastic story to tell and a great community spirit despite its rapid growth. It has a very vibrant scene of clubs and organisations and community infrastructure. However, it is a town that has grown exponentially and it deserves much better. With the Garda numbers available, there are barely enough gardaí to keep the station open and a patrol car out at night and during the day as well. The Garda cannot do what it would love to do which would be to put teams of two gardaí out on the street. We all know from the evidence that visibility of policing is the biggest deterrent to crime. In Carrigaline the resources are not available to put teams of two gardaí out patrolling the streets. There is barely enough to keep the squad car and the office open.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_5">As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management and administration of Garda business, which includes the allocation of Garda resources. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Simon Harris, has no direct role in matters of operational policing. The Government is committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs, with record funding of more that €2.14 billion allocated in the Garda budget in 2023. This includes the provision for the recruitment of up to 1,000 additional Garda members and 400 Garda staff this year and will enable sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I know the Minister engages regularly with the Garda authorities with a view to ensuring that every possible support is in place to deliver on this level of recruitment. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the number of attestations in 2022 was 369, with 145 in January, 70 in March, 101 in May and 53 in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The recruitment campaign last year for an Garda Síochána saw 11,000 people apply to join the service, which is a very positive and welcome response from the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">I know An Garda Síochána plans to run another recruitment campaign this year to ensure there is a strong pipeline of new recruits going forward. I am informed by the Garda authorities that at the end of December 2022, there were 14,133 members of An Garda Síochána, supported by more than 3,126 whole-time equivalent Garda staff. This represents an increase of just over 10% since 2015 when there were 12,816 Garda members in the country. In addition, recruitment of Garda staff has allowed Garda members to move from administrative to front-line roles.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> I understand that Carrigaline Garda station has 21 Garda members assigned as at the end of last year, with three sergeants and 18 gardaí. For example, comparing Garda resource allocation at the end of 2015 with the end of last year, the Togher district, which encompasses Carrigaline Garda station, has witnessed an increase in Garda members of more than 57%. By the end of last year, more than 880 Garda members had been assigned to operational roles under the Garda reassignment initiative and their previous roles assigned to Garda civilian staff. I am advised that An Garda Síochána is currently reviewing what further posts can be civilianised. Continued recruitment of Garda staff this year will further allow for trained Garda members to be freed up for front-line duties, where their training and policing expertise are vital in improving community safety and services to the public generally. Another key element of the Garda reform programme is the new operating model, which continues to be rolled out across all 19 Garda divisions. The new model is designed to streamline Garda administration and provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> The Minister will continue to engage closely with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the implementation of this ambitious programme of Garda reform and other measures to combat crime in our communities.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">As a small aside, it is a bit peculiar to make reference to districts given that the new operating model is based on the divisional model, as the Minister of State has mentioned. The districts are not really the metric any more. Making a comparison with 2015, which was the lowest point, is something of a distraction. In any event, we are focused on a particular part of the district, which is quite large and takes in much of the south side of Cork city and the outlying area. The population of much of that area has not significantly changed for the past 20 or 30 years. The issue here is that Carrigaline has grown exponentially, and I expect the same can be said of other commuter towns. Its population has exploded, multiplying in the past decade or two, and Garda resources have not kept pace. If there were to be an incident at night in one of the outlying areas, like Crosshaven or Passage, or if gardaí have to provide support in Douglas, there is no squad car in a town of 15,000 people, 5,000 of whom are under the age of 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> Some of the frustration on the ground is that gardaí do not have the capacity to go beyond just responding to issues. An awful lot of the focus of the community policing model, and even the new operating model, is about being proactive, building connections with community and preventing crime. If the resources are not there to put two gardaí on to the street to patrol a community, then that effort is seriously hampered. We need to get to a point where gardaí are not just firefighting but are proactively preventing crime, and are in a position to put strategies in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> The gardaí on the ground are absolutely fantastic. There are some really excellent gardaí. People will be familiar with the two community gardaí, Garda Damien Craven and Garda Stephen Cleary. There are many others but they are enormously stretched. The population figure I have given is taken from the most recent available census figures but I expect it could be close to 18,000 by the time the results of the latest census come back.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> I have made the point that there are 5,000 young people in the town, which is a huge number at one in three of the population. The youth diversion project in the community does not have a permanent building. That needs to be considered because we need to plan for the long term, which is something for which the Department does have direct responsibility.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">I again thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire for raising this very important matter. I will certainly convey his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Harris, on whose behalf I also thank the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The Deputy will be aware that the Government is rolling out a number of policy and legislative initiatives, which will reduce the level of criminal behaviour in our communities. These include introducing legislation to provide body worn cameras for gardaí and community CCTV schemes; rolling out the community safety innovation fund to drive the development of community safety projects at local level; examining the use of antisocial behaviour orders to ensure they are as effective as possible; introducing legislation to criminalise the grooming of children; and providing An Garda Síochána with new powers to cease and stop illegal use of scrambler bikes.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> As recognised by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, improving community safety requires a multi-sectoral approach, strong inter-agency collaboration and engagement from the community. The policy of establishing local community safety partnerships in communities, which is being rolled out by the Minister, will play a key role by creating tailor-made community safety plans with input from the local community and public services. An Garda Síochána will play a vital role in delivering this enhanced approach to community safety in local areas. I know the Minister trusts the Garda Commissioner and his team to continue making operational decisions on the best use of resources provided in the interests of all of our communities. This is more than simply a matter for An Garda Síochána. The Deputy rightly referred to youth diversion projects as well. We have seen a substantial increase in funding for youth diversion projects in the past two budgets - €6.7 million in the first budget and €2.9 million in the second. Coming from a base of about €15 million that is a huge increase, and we will continue with that roll-out.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">Lá le Bríde faoi mhaise daoibh freisin. This is my day, so I hope I have success with this topic. I know which Minister is taking this matter. I will use photographs and hand them to him when I am leaving. What I am looking at here is the age old question of mould and damp in local authority housing, and I want to remind the House that in 2015 a landmark collective complaint against Ireland from across 20 local authority estates was taken to the European Court of Justice. In 2017, the court found Ireland guilty and insisted that there must be rapid and immediate changes made to local authority houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> As late as last night, I visited Emmet Buildings in Dublin 8 and I also recently visited Oliver Bond flats. To say that people are living in disgracefully damp and mouldy conditions is probably an understatement. That is why I want to hand the Minister of State these photographs. They are incredible. I happened to be with a local school teacher who teaches in St. Brigid's National School in the Coombe. She mentioned to me the level of absenteeism and children being unable to attend school because of the impact that mould and damp has on their health. I have statements here from the World Health Organization and the National Health Service, two authorities that are looking at the question of mould and damp in local authority accommodation. This is poor accommodation that is impacting on respiratory health, the health of the skin, the health of children in particular but also the health of elderly people. The loss of time out of school should be enough to wake this Government up to the fact that these issues need to be dealt with in a timely fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> It is five years, maybe going on for six years, since the European Court of Justice ruled on this matter and very little has changed for these tenants. There are immediate solutions. They need better ventilation and new windows. Most of these flats still have single-glazed windows. They also need a retrofitting programme. However, at a minimum they need new windows and improved ventilation should be available to all of these local authority tenants. When we ask Dublin City Council what it is going to do about this issue this is the response. I have a question here to the chief executive in which I asked if there is climate action funding available.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">It was sent on 17 January. I asked if there was funding available in terms of climate action targets and for health and safety in these flat complexes. I asked what the council could do about them. The council stated that there is no specific Government fund available for window replacement and if additional funding becomes available, it can add more projects to the list. That is just not good enough. Funding needs to be made available, at least through actions to meet climate targets, to deal with this issue. There is a whole plethora of other issues to do with living in these complexes in the inner city. By the way, they are beautiful buildings, designed by Herbert George Simms. They would have won prizes back in the day. However, there have been hints from the council that these flats might go to the Land Development Agency. The LDA would love to flatten them because Emmet Buildings is surrounded by 12- and 14-storey high-rise vulture fund built accommodation. These are either aparthotels, student accommodation or very expensive apartments. More are planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> It is not right to treat communities like this. They are the heart of the city. Hundred of families are living in these conditions and although regeneration is promised, it takes far too long to deal with fundamental and basic health problems that these people face daily. What I want to tease out today is what the Government is going to do to insist that local authorities step up to the mark and deliver health and safety to people in their dwellings.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Kieran O'Donnell)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_24">I thank Deputy Smith for raising this important issue. In accordance with section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, local authorities are legally responsible for the management and maintenance of their housing stock. They also have a legal obligation to ensure that all of their tenanted properties are compliant with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019. Minimum standard for rental accommodation are prescribed in the regulations and focus on tenants’ safety. They specify the exact requirements in respect of a range of matters such as ventilation, structural repair and fire safety and ventilation, which has been specifically referred to by the Deputy. They also include sanitary facilities, heating and the safety of gas, oil and electrical installations. These regulations apply to all properties let or available for let, including social housing. All landlords, including local authorities, have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the standards set down in the regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Local authorities take cases of mould very seriously. Some 81% of Dublin City Council’s social housing units were built before the introduction of the building regulations in 1991. The Deputy referred to the fact that many of these are older buildings. Dwellings constructed prior to 1960 tend to have solid walls which are not very good at retaining heat. Dublin City Council is very keen to work closely with their tenants in helping to combat mould issues. In recent years, the council has carried out various works to help eliminate condensation. Phase 1 of its energy efficiency programme, with funding from my Department, saw 8,057 units upgraded with cavity walls and attics insulated. In phase 2, a further 1,110 units had their facades wrapped and windows upgraded. Some 80% of the council stock has been upgraded by the end of 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The council voids programme, also supported by Department funding, saw 772 voids upgraded in 2022 to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019. A housing condensation group was created by the council in 2017 which has carried out over 20,000 conditional surveys and damp reports on 2,500 units. Of these 2,500 units, mechanical ventilation has been installed in 1,300, which is just over 50% of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Responsibility for the enforcement of regulations in the private rental sector, including approved housing bodies' properties, rests with the relevant local authority. </p>
            <p eId="para_28"> The Deputy referred to Emmet Buildings and Oliver Bond flats. This is a matter which can be taken up with Dublin City Council to ensure that it goes out to visit the places and the residents spoken about by the Deputy. We cannot have children absent from school, as referred to by her.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> The Government is committed to ensuring that a high quality stock of rental accommodation is available for households who rent, be it in the private market or in accommodation provided directly by local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Notwithstanding the legal obligations on local authorities to manage and maintain their housing stock, my Department provides annual funding to local authorities in a focused way to support their work in this area, mainly via the disabled persons grant scheme and the aforementioned energy efficiency retrofitting and voids programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> My Department will continue to support local authorities in these focused stock improvement works and work is also ongoing with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association, CCMA, to drive a planned maintenance approach to the management and maintenance of all local authority housing stock. Local authorities are entrusted with providing high quality housing stock to social housing tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The Department is funding the development of a national asset management system for the sector that should greatly assist the sector in this task.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> There is a rental standing committee up and running in my Department with a number of local authorities. It looks at rental properties, and the Department and councils deal with properties. Dublin City Council is a member of that standing committee. It met in January and is due to meet again in early March. I will take up the matters raised by the Deputy specifically in respect of the tenants in Emmet Buildings and Oliver Bond flats me with my Department and will make direct contact with Dublin City Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Minister of State and I could say that I am very encouraged by that answer but I am not. I repeat that it is six years ago since the European court ruled against this State for the way in which local authority tenants are treated and the conditions in which they have to live, specifically around damp and mould, sewage and other problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> When one goes into one of these estates, the problems run deeper. There is rat infestation and playgrounds are not updated and are slippy and dangerous for children. In the case of Emmet Buildings, there is no proper emergency access for ambulances or fire brigades. There is a huge amount of absolute negligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The fact that Ireland was found to be guilty on the damp and mould issue is the issue I want to focus on here. I have asked the Minister of State a question which he has not addressed. Can we ensure that at least under climate action, funding is made available to upgrade all of the windows in these houses? One does not have to de-tenant the place to do that or to enter into a big urban regeneration project that lasts for a decade. One just gets the stock and puts in double- or triple-glazed windows in every single flat. This would make a huge difference to the quality of life and the level of mould and damp. To state the obvious, it would help to improve people's income in a cost-of-living crisis where they are paying a fortune to keep their flats warm. That is one specific question I would ask the Minister of State to address, namely, to try to get climate funding to deal with this issue of the windows and to ensure that proper ventilation is installed in every apartment.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Beyond that, if the Minister of State is meeting Dublin City Council, it also has to deal with rat infestation in many of these blocks. Some of this happens because buildings are being erected all around them, but this issue is not being dealt with. There are no responses that are worth a damn. People, very decent families and communities, are living with this day in, day out, children are missing school and health levels are very low.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, Dublin City Council has received State funding. In respect of the energy efficiency schemes in phase 1, with funding from my Department, it saw 8,057 housing units upgraded with cavity walls and attic insulation. In phase 2, a further 1,110 units had their facades wrapped and windows upgraded. Some 80% of the council housing had been upgraded by the end of 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> This is a matter that we will take up with Dublin City Council but these are the facts. If there are particular instances in particular buildings where, to date, that has not happened, obviously that is a matter for Dublin City Council. It is a matter we will take up with them and we will look at what funding is required. These are the facts as presented from Dublin City Council. State funding is being provided in the areas spoken about by the Deputy but it is a question of whether there are still buildings to be dealt with in that regard. The Deputy mentioned two buildings, Emmet Buildings and Oliver Bond flats, and we will take up the matter with Dublin City Council but to say that there is no State funding being provided for this area is not the case as there is.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">Gabhaim buíochas a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I am grateful that this Topical Issue matter has been selected which specifically looks at the project to reconfigure three mainstream classes to a two classroom special educational needs, SEN, base. The National Council for Special Education in November 2021 sanctioned a special class by letter. That process got underway. In April 2022, an application was made to the Department. In September 2022, funding was made available through the additional school accommodation scheme. As I understand it, a design team is now preparing a stage 1 report.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> It seems that there is very significant demand. I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is taking this matter. He knows the area well. It has a growing population with significant demand for special educational needs supports and accommodation. What is a reasonable timeframe to deliver on these projects? Where are the barriers? Are they at the Department, in planning or are they within the school? This is much-needed and needs to be delivered within a reasonable timeframe and I would welcome hearing from the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I thank the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle. I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague in the Department of Education, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who is not available. I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position in respect of the accommodation needs of Ratoath Junior National School, in Ratoath, County Meath and the Government's, my firm commitment, and the Department of Education's firm commitment to enabling students with additional needs to receive an education appropriate to those needs. As outlined by Deputy O'Rourke, the funding for a special educational needs reconfiguration project for Ratoath Junior National School was provided and announced last summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">A capital allocation has been provided for that associated with the planning and building unit's additional school accommodation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The project brief is to provide a two-classroom special educational needs base through the reconfiguration of three existing mainstream classrooms. The school submitted formal acceptance of the offer for reconfiguration works on 22 August 2022 and an official approval letter, advising the school of the funding allocated to reconfigure the three classrooms to meet the needs, and to provide a two-classroom special education needs base, was issued by the Department on 2 September 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The delivery of this project has been devolved to the school authority, which is the board of management, which acts as the contracting authority for the project. I have contacted the board of management regarding this project in recent times and recent months as well. What has happened, as the Department knows, and as the school told me and perhaps other local Deputies, is that a design team has been appointed by the school authority for the project. The appointed design team is working on drawing up plans for the reconfiguration and preparing a submission for Department officials to review in that regard. I assure Deputy O'Rourke and our constituents in Meath East that once this submission is provided by the design team to the Department, we will work very hard and quickly to get approval for it from the Department. It is not the biggest job in the history of special education needs provision. It is the reconfiguration of three existing classrooms into two classrooms, so I do not see why it would take an inordinate amount of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Over the last two years the Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special education placements ahead of the new school year. The Department continues to work with the NCSE regarding the short-term requirements for special class and special school places and also the more strategic and longer-term requirements. The number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 in 2011 to 2,148 in the last school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for children with autism. This year, the Department will invest more than €2 billion, or more than one quarter of its budget, in the area of special education needs support. As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The parents, the school and Department officials have my absolute commitment that I will work as hard as I can with colleagues to ensure this project is delivered. As I said, it is not the most difficult project that has ever been imagined in the history of education. Having spoken to the school, I know it is committed to the project and the Department is very much committed to it as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I welcome the response from the Minister of State, but it raises the question of why there is a delay. We would have hoped that we would have seen progress for this academic year, and more significant progress. This did not happen. There is now the question of whether this facility will be in place during this academic year or even in time for the start of the next academic year. I note the Minister of State's point regarding the NCSE looking at a streamlined and joined-up planning process. I have also received a response, having engaged with the school. It is saying it is following the Department's procedures and guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> Can efficiencies be gained by looking at these processes? Can these projects be delivered more quickly? Is there more room for improvement in this regard? What is a reasonable timeframe for delivering these projects? On what date are we likely to see this unit opened, all things going to plan? I encourage continued engagement in this regard. I know the Minister of State will do this, but we also need engagement from the Department. I will also engage from my perspective as a local Deputy. It is important that the full range of stakeholders, including the Department, engage in a proactive way. There have been delays and it has taken some time to get documentation together and to respond to requests from the Department. How quickly will this project be delivered? Is there room for efficiencies in the system overall?</p>

            <p eId="para_50">The situation is that there was much discussion about this issue, with parents being on to all of us last year. I was engaging with the board of management at that time, and with Department officials as well. On 2 September 2022, an agreement was completed regarding this project happening. The school was then told to go about doing it. It did that and appointed a design team to do the work. It is currently drawing up plans. As I understand it, this work will not require planning permission. Again, we will wait to see what the design team says, because it is an internal reconfiguration. This is happening. The design team will certainly get this work done and submitted. It was appointed some months ago now and it will put its submission into the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> I am now in the Department of Education, as Minister of State with special responsibility for physical education, as well as sport. I will certainly be working closely with officials to ensure there is no delay on our side because I know the importance of this project in Ratoath, as does, to be fair to its members, the board of management of Ratoath junior school as well. They are absolutely committed to this project, but they do have to go through certain procedures. I do not think it has been particularly long since September, although I am as impatient as everybody else for this project to be finished and for our children to have spaces in their local area, which has always been a key priority of the Government and must be a key priority for all of us.</p>

            <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_52">I thank the Leas Cheann-Comhairle for facilitating the discussion of this Topical Issue matter. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, recorded 2,892 victims of sexual violence in 2021, with roughly 80% of these being girls and women. For that same year, Women's Aid received 1,104 disclosures of sexual abuse, including 411 disclosures of rape. This is a specific and serious dimension of the epidemic of gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Today, I am focusing on one aspect of this broader issue, namely, sexual assault treatment units. It was revealed this week that there was a 25% rise in the numbers presenting at the six HSE sexual assault treatment units. This was the first year the figure was above 1,000. One fifth of those were aged between 14 and 17. These units, in Dublin, Galway, Cork, Waterford, Mullingar and Donegal, do incredible work in treating and helping victims who arrive in a highly vulnerable state. They provide specialised care that is focused on the person. These figures underline their crucial role.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Based on the increase last year, I urge the Minister of State to work with the HSE to provide additional funding and posts to support existing services and the expansion of outreach services. The outreach clinics, in particular, are essential. The Cork city unit recently opened clinics in Bantry, in my constituency, and in Tralee. These are welcome developments and we need more of them. We cannot tolerate a situation where, for example, victims of rape have to go two hours in a car before they get to one of the assessment units because, without going into too much detail around it, people cannot shower before they have those assessments and the further people are from those units, the more traumatic it is for them to travel there.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> There is clearly an established need for these centres and for more of them. This is specific work that needs highly trained professionals and there must be investment to recruit and train more staff. This is a complex area to discuss. Each and every incident is truly horrific and wrong and it is important that when people experience these awful crimes and violations that they feel they can turn to and trust our health services. It is also important to say that this is a health service that is separate to the Garda. The health services work closely with law enforcement but no one is compelled to make an official report. It is a highly victim-centred approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Professor Maeve Eogan, the national clinical lead for the HSE's sexual assault treatment units and consultant obstetrician at the Rotunda Hospital, described the situation very well when she said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_57">If you are an optimist you would say more people know about our service, so hopefully the totality of sexual crime is not increasing and people are seeking care and seeking support and accessing that at a time and place that suits them and is responsive to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">Given that we know that reported cases of sexual assault and rape are only the tip of the iceberg and that more people are attending these units, it is clear that more specialist centres will facilitate more victims in coming forward and getting tailored medical and psychological assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> There is also a need to understand the implications of these numbers. As Professor Eogan stated, it is unclear if these figures relate to an increase in sexual assaults or in reporting. </p>
            <p eId="para_60">We need a unified approach to understand the issues involving the HSE, An Garda Síochána, violence support organisations and researchers. Will the Minister of State clarify when the updated Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland survey will be published? It was commenced by the CSO in 2018 and was due for completion within five years. It will be significant in shaping our understanding and policy development.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_61">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic. It is a terrible reality that sexual assault and violence continue within our society. The 2022 annual report for sexual assault treatment units, SATUs, in Ireland is yet to be finalised but the provisional data for 2022 show that approximately 1,050 people attended across the six units in Ireland in that year. This represents an increase of 191, or 22%, on the 2021 attendance figure of 859. I note that the 2018 and 2019 attendance figures were almost identical at 941 and 943, respectively. The 2022 figure shows an increase of almost 110, or 12%, on both 2018 and 2019. This 12% increase over the four-year period since 2018 gives perhaps the most balanced view of trends over recent years and should be viewed through the lens of work we are doing across government to encourage more victims to come forward to seek supports and report these heinous crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> Sexual violence is defined as any sexual act performed on the victim without consent. SATUs support people who have experienced rape or sexual assault and provide responsive and person-focused care for people aged 14 years and older who have experienced sexual violence. There are six SATUs throughout Ireland located in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Mullingar, Letterkenny and Waterford. Each unit aims to provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week and respond within three hours to ensure that people can access care in a timely fashion, as set out in the 2023 publication, Sexual Assault Treatment Unit National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination Following Rape and Sexual Assault. The SATUs are geographically distributed to enable any patient nationally to access the service within a three-hour window, optimising both the health and criminal justice responses to sexual crimes. The Government has always been very clear that regardless of the circumstances in which sexual violence has occurred, a victim of these crimes can and should report their experience to An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Victims of these crimes also have the option of calling the excellent front-line services provided by organisations such as the Rape Crisis Centre, which offer non-judgmental support, a listening ear and information. Their services are for both women and men and the work they do in this difficult space needs to be commended. The services provided by SATUs have two main components: the provision of health and supportive care, and the collection of forensic evidence. SATUs are the key health sector supports available to victims of rape and sexual assault. Responsibility for responding to sexual violence is shared across government.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The Government's commitment to tackling the issue of sexual violence is further demonstrated by the publication of the O'Malley review implementation plan, Supporting A Victim’s Journey: A Plan to Help Victims and Vulnerable Witnesses in Sexual Violence Cases, and the work being progressed through the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which was launched last year. Through the Supporting a Victim's Journey plan, a number of recommendations to support victims of sexual crime have been progressed, including recommendations on the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, the introduction of trained intermediaries, training for front-line professionals and actions to reduce delays in the trial process.</p>

            <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Minister of State. I have no doubt that she understands the significance of this area. I urge her to speak to the Minister for Health about how the HSE can develop increased capacity and geographical spread to deal with this horrific epidemic. I draw attention to the fact that the initial data show that one fifth of those who attended these units last year - over 200 people - were aged 14 to 17, a particularly worrying number. We do not know if this is due to an increase in rates of assault and violence or an increase in reporting. Regardless, it must be a wake-up call. We know that these figures are replicated in other findings. The National Women's Council of Ireland has highlighted that young women aged 18 to 34 are twice as likely to be subjected to sexual harassment and violence than women on average. In all of the Government's efforts to address gender-based violence, there must be a clear emphasis on responding to these worrying levels among young women.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> Every time I raise these issues, I call for immediate reform of sexual and relationship education. Young people need to be properly educated on matters of consent and sexual health; it is that simple. It is clear that delays in these changes are facilitating harm. The debate is long over; we need those reforms now. Sexual assaults and violence at a young age impact a person's whole life. We must do everything we can to prevent these despicable crimes. There must be specific integrated strategies involving health, education, law, youth organisations and sports clubs to respond to this issue. Nothing less than a whole-of-government response is required to intervene effectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I thank the Deputy again for raising this important topic. In my concluding remarks, I wish to refer to the SATU policy review, which began in September 2018 and concluded in February 2019 and examined the efficacy of these treatment units. The review team comprised staff from the Department of Health, the then Department of Justice and Equality, the HSE and the SATUs. I am pleased to say the implementation of the policy review recommendations has been completed. The fifth edition of the National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination Following Rape and Sexual Assault, have been developed this year as an inter-agency document to ensure clearly defined referral pathways exist in order that all people, regardless of age or gender, can access appropriate individualised care that is responsive to their needs. The implementation of the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy for the period 2022 to 2026, as well as the completion of a range of other projects across many Government Departments, will be essential in achieving the aim of reducing sexual crime. Responsibility for responding to sexual violence is shared across the Government. I am aware that the Department of Justice has agreed with the CSO to the development and delivery of a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. It will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse for both women and men in Ireland. Having the most relevant and up-to-date data on the prevalence of sexual violence will continue to help us to plan for better services and supports for victims, including across SATUs.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_70">That Dáil Éireann: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_71">acknowledges that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_72">— as demand for housing continues to grow, thousands of housing units will need to be built in the State, largely in sizeable and concentrated developments;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_73">— urban and rural communities around large population centres will see substantial increases in population as new developments are built;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_74">— increases in population will see significant changes in landscapes, communities and quality-of-life;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_75">— spending on community projects and services, by councils and other funding sources, was severely reduced as a result of the recession, due to Government cuts to grants and funding, and has not returned to commensurate levels; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_76">— current legislation for development levies provides "public infrastructure" funding but does not ensure "community gain";</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_77">recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_78">— new developments will see concentrated increases in population in both urban and rural areas around large population centres;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_79">— increases in population will place significant pressure on, and require significant changes to, the existing services, amenities and facilities of the communities in those areas;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_80">— without significant increases from post-recession levels of council spending, communities will struggle to adapt to such pressures and changes;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_81">— communities deserve to see such pressures and changes off-set by guaranteed material improvements in their area;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_82">— local areas and communities should have a direct material control in the development of new services, amenities, and facilities through their local elected representatives; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_83">— councils currently use discretionary fund mechanisms to allocate funds to local areas; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_84">calls on the Government to: </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_85">— ringfence a proportion of development levies, at least 20 per cent, within the local area in which they are drawn from, in order to guarantee that communities experiencing high levels of new developments receive commensurate increases in funding;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_86">— ensure that these areas receive material improvements, in addition to any needed expansions in services, amenities and facilities, to off-set major changes for their communities;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_87">— allocate the ringfenced proportion of development levies through a discretionary fund mechanism in each local area office, to be administered and spent at the discretion of the elected members for that area; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_88">— consider amending section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to facilitate these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I have put this motion forward because this issue is coming up frequently in communities, particularly where a lot of development is being built and is on the agenda. The State is in the middle of a deep housing crisis. People cannot get homes and cannot afford to rent. There is dire need in this country for new affordable housing. If we are to have any chance of dealing with this crisis, thousands of houses a year would need to be built in the State over the coming decades. It has been reported that the Housing Commission has estimated that between 42,000 and 62,000 new housing units will need be built per year until 2050. There is a clear need for those houses to be built. There is a deep need for homes in this country but there are very real worries in communities across Ireland on what effect this level of development will have on them. We foresee huge rises in population in urban and rural areas, which will fundamentally change the communities there. If new developments are not carefully planned and the affected communities are not properly invested in, people will see huge pressures on the services and facilities they rely on in their communities and will experience huge changes in their quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> Communities, especially working-class communities, are stretched to their limit at the moment. Since the recession we have seen huge cuts to community funding and services, and to the council budgets many communities rely on. A study from 2018 showed that council capital spending fell by 75% in nominal terms between 2007 and 2014, which meant a cut of approximately €5 billion. Another study from 2015 estimated that cuts in funding in the community and voluntary sectors amounted to between 8% and 10% per year from 2008 to 2013. The reality is that funding for councils and the community sector has not come back to where it needs to be. Many communities are already struggling to meet their current needs. Many working-class communities across the country are already dealing with chronic underfunding and lack of investment. Communities will not be able to cope with these huge increases in population if they do not have the funds, supports and investment they need. If we do not ensure proper improvements in funding and services, there will be huge negative changes in how people live their lives, how they support themselves and their families, and how they feel in their own communities. This motion is an attempt to put money and control back in the hands of the communities and their elected representatives because the people who live in these areas know better than anyone else what their communities need now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Regarding the Government proposals, while I acknowledge the Government has made steps to address some issues, there seems to be no proposal to guarantee proper targeted funding for the communities facing this influx of developments. We need targeted and localised spending to ensure the areas that will see the most development, and are least able to adapt to it, are guaranteed the funds they need. The people in those communities and their elected representatives need and deserve a say in this. The Housing for All programme released by the Government states that councils will pay a key role in ensuring the communities feel the benefits from these new developments, but it makes no provision for direct or discretionary control of the funding. There is no provision for how these communities will have a say, what money their areas will get, or what it will be spent on. There is no provision to ensure the communities hit the hardest will be guaranteed commensurate funds. There is no provision to ensure communities already struggling and dealing with lost and reduced services and funding are guaranteed to receive the supports needed to deal with the problems they have now, let alone in the future. This is especially important with regard to the reporting on the Dublin City Council capital programme that has just been released in the <i>Dublin Inquirer</i> . The distribution of funds raised by levies is woefully uneven across the city. While this may be balanced out by other areas of spending, levies are of heavy importance to many areas of spending such as cultural, recreational and amenity spending. An outsized proportion of levies was spent in the most affluent local area and the north side received less funding than any other local area despite the fact that Dublin City Council's own study found that large swathes of the north side suffered from a lack of community and recreational infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Communities know what they need, what they are missing and what it will take to improve their areas now and in the future. The Government is simply not adequately reacting to what communities will be faced with down the line. There needs to be real involvement in the process from communities and they need direct power to effect the change they need. The point was made in the <i>Dublin Inquirer </i> report that there has been a wider debate in Dublin City Council during the development plan, and at the housing and finance committees, in relation to development levies and how they are distributed. The councils which asked for the report have been pressing for some of the money paid by a developer in levies for a particular site to be spent near the site where the construction is happening. Projects funded by development levies generally move faster than those funded, by say, central government grants, although those outside of the council's control are riskier.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I would like to refer to a case study: Dynamic Drimnagh, which is an umbrella body of sports, community groups and residents, etc., in the area. The Dynamic Drimnagh development plan states that it is a community group made up of different voluntary groups and individuals from the area. They formed the Dynamic Drimnagh forum in 2021 to develop a plan for the area which is for, and by, the community. </p>
          <p eId="para_94">The plan was submitted to the Dublin city development plan public consultation. The plan states it is built on the established history of community activism and reflects the potential vibrancy and diversity of a growing and changing community. Drimnagh has a population of 12,500. Over the coming years, at least eight large brownfield sites will be developed there. This will result in 10,000 new housing units and more than double the population in the same physical space. Many of its existing recreation facilities, such as Brickfield Park and the Bosco youth centre, already need more funding. Sports clubs, parks and youth centres that are at the centre of the community and kept alive by the dedication of volunteers are in bad need of expansion to cater for the growing population.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Some areas lack supermarkets and large shopping spaces. Some areas need cycle lanes and better maintained footpaths. Healthcare and child services need to be expanded. There is a real need for new civic culture and recreational spaces. The plan covers this in detail. It is a well thought-out plan written by the people of Drimnagh because they know what their community needs. It is based on five pillars of strategic growth. These include offering a cohesive and inclusive community-led approach to facing the problems in future, the integration of new developments into the physical space of communities with regard to appropriate housing for the area and an in-depth look into planned developments and their infrastructural needs, transport and traffic improvement to ensure safe mobility for all and the regeneration of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> My position on building height in areas such as Cabra and Finglas in the city is that there should be a maximum of four storeys. Dynamic Drimnagh also considered the strategic development regional area, which outlines heights of between four and eight storeys. Its position is that housing should be four storeys at the front and it should go up in height at the back or middle.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> The third pillar is a plan to protect and improve green spaces, waterways and areas of nature, to have a community-led plan for environmental challenges and climate change and to use the geography of Drimnagh to create a canal village with a canal promenade and cycleway. The fourth pillar establishes a committee to plan for educational services and facilities in the area to improve access to formal and informal learning in the community. The fifth pillar is a comprehensive plan for health, well-being, leisure and culture in Drimnagh. It highlights the need for greater youth and elderly supports and services and the need for real investment in recreation facilities in the area's parks and community centres. Central to this is a plan for a new civic and sports centre to provide a real base for the community and offer a cultural space to hold events and festivals to encourage integration of new members in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Reading the Dynamic Drimnagh development plan gives a real sense of the level of commitment, local knowledge and care of the community who want improvements for the people who live in Drimnagh now and who will live there in the future. The Dynamic Drimnagh development plan estimates €63 million of levies would be raised on just eight of the sites in development, with a possible €30 million brought in from another six sites. This is almost €100 million in levies across 14 sites in Drimnagh alone. There is a need for funding investment for community and civic services and facilities in the area. The community has a clear plan for how these should be delivered. There is no reason the plan cannot receive a guaranteed number of levies raised in the area. According to a recent strategic policy committee on finance report, Dublin City Council intends to spend only €24 million in development levies on capital projects in Dublin South Central compared to €70 million of development levies being spent in south-east Dublin on its capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> The purpose of the motion is clear. In the coming decades there will be changes for communities throughout Ireland and those communities deserve the power and the money to react to those changes. There needs to be thousands of new developments in the country to meet housing needs. They will affect the physical geography of areas. Communities will see large increases in population. They will put huge pressure and strain on services and facilities that are already struggling and underfunded. Many of these communities are those worst hit by the austerity enforced on them after the recession. They do not have proper or adequate funding supports or services to deal with the problems coming down the road. People will see their lives change and they deserve to see real positive improvements in their communities to offset this. They deserve a direct say in this through their representative groups and elected councillors. There is no one better to decide the needs of the communities than the communities themselves. Development levies provide a direct mechanism through which communities can draw down funds. They are tied to localities and do not rely on the market prices of land. They need to be ring-fenced to guarantee that some of them stay in the areas where they are raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Councils use a discretionary funding mechanism administered through local areas by elected representatives. Councillors are in a perfect position to know the needs of their communities. They are involved in local groups and services. They know the reality on the ground and they are intimately tied to the people in the areas they represent. The discretionary funding mechanism is an existing model of distributing funds to local communities to meet local needs. It works and it is tied to community needs and requirements. We have a model that raises levies based on the location of city developments. We know exactly the location of the developments from where the funds come. We know exactly what communities will be affected by them. This is not hard. We can amend section 48 of the Planning and Development Act. We can tie this into any future legislative change. We can legislate to give better direction to local authorities. People deserve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> The motion is an effort to put some of the money raised from developments back into the hands of the people most affected by them. It will guarantee funding to areas that need it. It will go part of the way to meeting the austerity of the past and ensuring that communities facing real change in the future see real benefits from it. Most importantly, it will give people real material power over the future of their communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_103"> I am struck by the difference in language on this. I will go local for a minute and I will come back to the point on language. Lately all of the Deputies in Galway fought a battle on the need for a community centre in Westside and Newcastle. The community had to apply to a particular fund but it lost out. I and those involved wonder why a community centre was not part of the development of the area in the first place, instead of having to try to source funding for it. It was a nightmare and the community did not get it. Fast forward to the budget and we were left meeting the Minister to try to create a special fund for new community centres because the existing fund was only for enhancements. This is now under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> I say all of this having listened to my colleague, Deputy Collins, speak about Dynamic Drimnagh. The language of the people and what is needed in an area caught my attention. I have a document from Dublin City Council. I will not comment on particular councils but I have a document that is in response to this issue. It is from the head of finance and, fair play to the person, it is a comprehensive letter. The contrast in language is stark. Perhaps this is where the problem lies. We have ignored communities and their needs and what is necessary to have a living community, which is what is behind the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The document is a report to the strategic policy committee on finance. First there is an apology because there were other priorities and stresses on the council so the matter was never teased out where it should have been, which was at the strategic policy committee on finance. At the bottom of the document it is stated it will be teased out in the public consultation on levies. This is not the way to tease it out. The levies have continued in the matter in which they were introduced and we do not have equity of access to the levies. I am no expert but it is quite clear from what we are seeing that serious issues have been raised as to which communities get what, when they get it and how they get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Let us go back to the document. It states the matter has not been discussed because there were other priorities. This shocks me because the issue with levies exists everywhere and has existed for a long time. It states it has to be done on a whole-of-city strategic level. I understand this. I found myself swinging back and forth until I looked at the consequences of the way the levies have been distributed. This is the problem. I was swinging with this language until I saw the phrase "public assets deficits". This is what we are speaking about. What language is this? There is "community wealth building". The council has set up a community wealth building working group. Apparently it is doing very well and it will have an implementation plan. In the 21st century, in 2023, a key principle of community wealth building is equity and access to public facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">It is worth reading those three and a half pages because they capture what has happened with language. Language has been captured in corporate language and we are talking about "public assets" as opposed to community assets and what Deputy Collins has just outlined about the Dynamic Drimnagh forum, which is what is necessary. It could be replicated in Galway and every other place but we get choked with this type of language and there is no recognition it is time for an analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Some areas in Dublin are known as better areas and seem to get more levies. I am no expert and do not know if that is right but it is what is being said by councillors while, at the same time, the same councillors are saying they really want what they are getting here. However, with what we are facing and the figures that have been quoted for more than 60,000 houses per year and all the development that is going ahead, and notwithstanding the crisis we are shouting at the Government daily to do something about, it cannot be done on its own and must be matched with community plans such as the Dynamic Drimnagh one. There must be recognition we cannot put up structures just for the sake of a crisis to say we are doing something without having a living, breathing community with proper facilitates and a real honest talk about how many storeys are appropriate. Deputy Collins proposed four storeys and I agree with her. That dialogue is missing in Galway as well. We must ask what type of city we want and what type of towns we want while all the time solving the housing crisis and facing our climate obligations. I again thank Deputy Collins.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_112">We will arrange for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The Government shares that interest and, therefore, will not oppose the motion. I will share with Deputies an outline of the existing measures in place in addition to those further proposed measures that are in line with the spirit of the motion, namely, that the uplift in funding derived from new developments benefits those affected communities. The Government recognises the need for services, amenities and facilities benefiting communities to be developed and enhanced in connection with new development, including housing development. It is an integrated approach and we all agree on that. This recognition is evidenced through existing and proposed legislative provisions with a view to enabling and empowering local authorities to channel funding from existing development contributions and proposed future sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Concerning existing legislative provisions, there are mechanisms in place under existing legislation set out in sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, which I think Deputy Connolly referenced, to permit planning authorities to secure development contributions towards local infrastructure projects. The preparation and adoption of sections 48 and 49 development contribution schemes involve a key decision-making role for elected members, and elected members are involved in determining the priority to be afforded to projects within the functional area of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> I will outline Government policy and objectives in this area where legislative developments. As well as continuing to support the existing arrangements, the Government recognises the need for additional infrastructure and for "community gain" to be secured in connection with new housing development. This has previously been acknowledged in the programme for Government, the Housing for All plan and is being progressed through the current legislative proposals to develop land value sharing measures. These legislative proposals have been developed in response to the recognition in the programme for Government that there is a need for community gain in planning decisions. Housing for All set out in greater detail the intention to respond to the Kenny report of 1973 and the recommendations made by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and others on the need to reform Ireland’s system of land management.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I move to the matter of proposed land value sharing and local authority funding. To ensure that the State secures an appropriate proportion of the uplift in land values that results from public decisions to zone or designate land for development and that the necessary public infrastructure, services and facilities to support development within the local authority area can be provided, proposals are being developed to introduce a land value sharing mechanism that involves the local authority securing a proportion of the uplift between the existing use value of the land at the point of zoning, and the market value of the land with the benefit of zoning.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> The general scheme of the land value sharing and urban development zones Bill was approved by Government in December last and will also include provisions to empower local authorities to designate areas with significant potential for development, including housing, as candidate urban development zones and for the Government to designate such areas as urban development zones. These areas will be a focus of State investment in key enabling infrastructure to ensure the potential for development can be realised in a timely manner. Deputy Collins made reference to that. The proposals include a key role for elected members and the local community in the adoption of a framework for the development of the area within the development plan and in the adoption of detailed schemes for the master planning of the areas. State investment in infrastructure in these areas will further support the land value sharing mechanisms and sections 48 and 49 contributions schemes in place for the local authority to secure obligations in connection with development and to spend in connection with the provisions of public infrastructure, services and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> Accordingly, the Government will not oppose the motion as, in a general sense, it is aligned with the spirit of Government policy concerning the channelling of revenues arising from development is already established, and work is also under way to develop this funding principle further. The Government welcomes those funding developments that are currently being progressed. These represent a significant uplift in obligations secured by local authorities that ultimately should benefit communities. I am confident that the finalisation of legislation under way to deliver land value sharing in the coming weeks will deliver on our shared aims and look forward to progressing this important work.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Copies of the speech should be here shortly.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_120">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Government is not opposing the motion. It has become a trend over the past while that the Government has not opposed motions but it means it is not going to do anything with them. It would be, therefore, be more honest if the Government opposed the motion and voted it down because in reality it is not going to do anything. The Minister of State's words do not provide any enlightenment as to whether it is going to do anything about this development either. That is the sad thing about it. It would be more honest, straightforward and forthright for it to vote down the motion because that is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I thank my colleague, Deputy Collins, and all in her office for bringing forward such a motion as it is important and worthwhile. New data from EUROSTAT showed that last year Ireland was, once again, the EU’s fastest growing economy, but where is this reflected? It certainly is not reflected in our communities. Spending on community projects and community services was slashed during the recession and spending on these projects and services has still not returned to pre-recession levels. Census 2022 showed the population in every county has increased since census 2016 and, naturally, there is increased demand for more services, amenities and facilities in our communities. The motion puts forward a sensible and practical solution to this, namely, to ring-fence at least 20% of development levies within the local area from which they are drawn to guarantee communities experiencing high levels of new developments receive commensurate increases in funding. The Minister of State said this was provided for in sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act. Section 49, which he said is for public infrastructure and so on is specific in what that can mean, that is, car parks, rail developments, sewage treatment and drainage facilities. Where is the public infrastructure in that? Where is the community infrastructure in that? It is not provided for under that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">That is the problem and that is why the motion has been tabled. Section 48 does not provide anything for this. The language is also interesting because the section mentions facilities benefitting development in the area of the planning authority, so basically anywhere in the county. For instance, in County Donegal, development levies can be levied in Glencolumbkille and used to provide a sewage treatment works in Moville, which is 100 miles away. That is seen as being a relevant development contribution. That is the problem people have with development contributions and how this is worded at the moment. The reality is that the development contribution scheme is a way of replacing money the Government is refusing to give to local authorities and to make up for shortfalls in capital funding. That is what happens with it and that is all that it is. </p>
          <p eId="para_123"> Any community infrastructural gain is not included in the scheme because if local authorities did that, they would get less money for capital infrastructure. As things stand, if 20% of the development contributions were taken for community facilities that means they would lose funding and get 20% less funding for water and sewerage schemes, road developments and so on in their functional area. The reality is that the councils will not do that and that is what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> In addition, the funding local authorities get for roads development and works is dependent on the amount they put into it themselves. The more money they can put in, the more they can draw down from the Department. What then happens is that money that is paid for housing rents is diverted to roads infrastructure to increase the amount that can be drawn down from Government. Therefore, funding for development on housing estates and schemes or for the repair of houses suffers because the local authorities are forced to try to maximise the amount they can draw down for roads by pumping in other funding. This is the system we have in this country where it is all controlled and we basically do not have local authorities, as such. We have funding measures by which the money is transferred from the Government down and that is the reality and why so much time is spent talking about local authority business in the Dáil because this is where the decisions are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> It is only fair that communities are given the opportunity to reap the benefits of new developments in their areas and <i>vice versa</i>. Developments will only benefit from investing in the community around them. The people with the money who want to build the developments and the local authorities do not believe that, but that is the reality. It is the communities that make areas, not buildings. The development contribution scheme has contributed to many important projects in my county of Donegal, such as the development of a countywide coastal erosion programme, which is again to supplement funding that should come from local government and the development of the Donegal Craft Village and Sliabh Liag. Ring-fencing at least 20% of development levies would bring far more opportunity to fund these projects, as well as many other projects and services. </p>
          <p eId="para_126"> An important factor missing from the scheme, which would be introduced with the implementation of the motion, is the focus on the local area in which the development levies are drawn from. The Donegal Development Contribution Scheme 2016-2021 states: "It is not possible to forensically allocate the costs of each sub-area of such infrastructural and associated services activity to the equally broad range of development categories". What a load of gobbledygook. It basically says that funding will not be allocated locally because it has to be allocated in the county. That is the reality and local communities can go to hell because they will not get any of it. </p>
          <p eId="para_127"> In order for communities to directly benefit from a development levy, and for developments to benefit from the payment of this levy, the contribution should go directly to the local area. I support the motion’s call to allocate the ring-fenced proportion of development levies through a discretionary fund mechanism in each local area office, to be administered and spent at the direction of elected members for that area. Local elected members have a much better understanding of what their community needs. I do not believe the council as a whole making decisions on projects and services to invest in for the entire county, especially one as big as Donegal, is an effective use of development levies. It would be much more effective for the levies to go directly to the local area office and for the projects and services to be decided by local elected members.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I also believe we need to adopt a more community-centred approach and, as the motion states, current legislation for development levies provides for public infrastructure funding but does not ensure community gain. Communities should be at the heart of legislation such as this and these levies should not aim to provide infrastructure, but to improve communities as a whole. The two sometimes do not go hand in hand. By establishing a local area office, there would be far more opportunity for community consultation and a community voice. Providing public infrastructure without a community focus is pointless and a waste of money, which is why it is so important to localise the use of development levies and allow for the type of growth and development that people actually want and need in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The Government often states that the Opposition does not put forward ideas and solutions but the motion is a solution to the increased demand for more services, amenities and facilities in our communities, which is affecting the quality of life of our citizens. If this Government does not start offering up solutions to this issue, such as the one put forward today, then we will continue to see the mass exodus of people, particularly young people, from all our communities. </p>
          <p eId="para_130"> I acknowledge that Deputy O'Donnell is a new Minister of State and that he is getting to know his role but it would be better for him to vote down the motion because, in reality, the Government will not do anything that is proposed in the motion. We know that and if they are relying on sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act, it will not happen anyway. The Government should just be truthful and honest about this. Communities that do not understand how this place works may they have gained something when they gained nothing and, therefore, rather than agreeing the motion, it would be more honest to vote it down and say the Government it not interested. It is perfectly entitled to do that. The Minister of State is in government and can say what he wants to do and if this is not something he wants to do, that is fair enough. The next time we will get a Government that hopefully will want to do it. That is what government is about and that is the way it should be. What the Minister of State is doing now is totally ingenuous to the people out there who are looking at this and for Government to respond and give some gains. If the Government is not going to do that, just do not do it and tell the people they will not do it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denise Mitchell<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_131">I wish the Minister of State well in his new role. Communities across the State are in serious need of proper investment with many people left without the facilities one would expect in any thriving community. Doctors, banks, schools, youth facilities, primary healthcare centres and childcare facilities are some of the amenities one would anticipate being at the heart of any small town or suburb that has been planned in a way that properly provides for its population. Large-scale housing is needed but we must remember that when constructing housing in an area that we are building a community that is there to stand for decades to come. It makes sense that when there are spikes in the population, such as in my constituency of Dublin Bay North, and in Fingal, we need to create sustainable public spaces and the services to cope with the number of people who will live in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> One aspect of council development levies that I would like to see improved is the ability for councils to pursue and collect outstanding charges owed to them. According to a parliamentary question response from the previous Minister in May last year, there was €287 million in uncollected development levies owed to councils at the end of 2020. The four local authorities in Dublin alone were owed €150 million while Cork council and Kildare County Council were owed €13 million, respectively. I think we will all agree that these are significant sums. They would go a long way to support development projects that are being built to serve new communities and that would serve existing communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> There are any number of small or medium-sized projects in my constituency in need of investment and financial support, including even the simplest facilities such as a playground. Two areas in my constituency that are campaigning for a playground - Kilmore West and Harmonstown - and they are getting nowhere. When we see the moneys that have not been collected, it is not acceptable that people have to take to the streets to have a playground built in this day and age. Another point I will raise is that we have two fantastic football clubs, John Vianney FC and Kilmore Celtic FC. The two clubs have fantastic volunteers and one of them has 23 football teams These clubs and the young people playing with them have had to take to the streets. Two weeks ago they took to the streets to highlight the need for them to have a playing pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">It is madness. We must support these people, particularly those in our communities who are supporting our young people and keeping them in sport. These clubs have been fighting for these facilities for years. I know there are many other Deputies throughout Dublin experiencing the same issue in their areas with similar projects. Surely this money should be provided to our communities to support these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Dublin has been found wanting with regard to quality public building and spaces for recreational use. The lack of such spaces chips away at the sense of community and ownership in our areas. The results of the census published last summer highlight the pace at which the population has grown across the State. As expected, the larger urban centres have seen the most significant shifts but less densely populated areas are also beginning to see real growth. I suspect this is driven by crazy house prices, with lower income families not able to afford to buy a property in the places they live. They are probably moving away from the cities as remote working becomes the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> Some of my colleagues may speak to this matter in detail but it is important that development plans for the coming decades are more reflective of recreational spaces and more considerate of the services our communities require. Local authorities must be empowered and financially resourced. Likewise, councillors must be trusted to make the right decisions for the areas they represent. For far too long, we have seen the role of councillors and local authorities reduced to just local administration with all the power lying with local government. Councillors working for the people of Kildare, Cork or Galway know their areas best and want to act in the interests of the people who elect them. We must look at a better way of doing things when it comes to mapping out new communities and make our best efforts to improve existing communities that lack amenities. A step change is needed at local level to ensure we are building sustainable communities and empowering those living within them to take real ownership of and pride in where they live.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_137">I thank the Independent Group for tabling this important motion. In County Donegal, as well as in counties Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Limerick, thousands of families are living in defective concrete block homes. For many years, they were stymied and held back from getting justice and a redress scheme that would allow them to rebuild their lives. They did nothing wrong. Due to light-touch regulation and the absence of regulation in this State, they were left with homes that are falling apart.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> It took 20,000 people to come to the streets of Dublin, mostly from my home county of Donegal and the other counties I mentioned, to finally make the Government see some sense, yet we still do not have a redress scheme that is fair. What I found most objectionable was Government leadership figures talking about having to pay out billions. They were speaking to the rest of the taxpayers, telling them this would cost billions of their money. There was no talk about injustice or the failure of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over many years. The intention was basically to divide and conquer citizens and to take away the empathy and solidarity for those families whose lives had been destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The same Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael leadership figures have choices to make at every single budget. Yesterday, I and other Deputies, including Deputy Pringle, hosted a very important briefing from Oxfam Ireland and Social Justice Ireland. What they revealed was astonishing. Just two people in this country earn more than half the population. The combined wealth of these two people is €15 billion, while the combined wealth of half the population, those at the other end of the spectrum, is €10.2 billion. There is a failure in every budget to put in place a fair wealth tax. Oxfam Ireland believes that a fair incremental tax on the wealthiest, those earning over €4.7 million per year, could raise €8.2 billion every year. The Government complained about a cost of between €2.5 billion and €3 billion for a defective block scheme that would be spread over 20 years. That is approximately €250 million or €300 million per year over a 20-year period. The Government could, however, raise more than €8.2 billion per year from a modest tax on the wealthiest in society. My final point is on the type of wealth these people have. It is not productive and does not benefit the country. It goes into investment funds and so on and floats around the unproductive economy. This proposal makes absolute sense. I ask the Government to be honest when it tries to divide and conquer our citizens in future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_140">Right across Cork city, new communities are being welcomed with new neighbours. These expanded areas see their communities being built up without services being put in place. Why is it that when housing estates are being built the services are not put in either beforehand or at the same time as the development? Since the boundary extension of 2019, which saw large parts of the county transferred into the city boundaries, the city has not received the development levies. As a result, these communities were at a loss and left short of footpaths, lighting, improvements to roads, pedestrian crossings and other safety measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> A community in my constituency, Kerry Pike, which is a beautiful little village, has doubled in size following the construction of estates and more estates will be built. Not one penny from the levies went into the community. I thank the locals who, when that area was included in the city, stood up and advocated for services. They now have pedestrian crossings and have seen improvements to some footpaths. When a community is doubled in size, the services must go in at the same time. In Kerry Pike, there is a school that did not have pedestrian crossings or footpaths for years. The children had to cross a road that was being used as a rat run because the northern ring road was never built. In many other areas, for example, Glanmire and Ballyvolane, we will see the same happen under the development plan. What we do not have is a strategic plan to put in place the infrastructure and services that these communities need. If we build communities, they must be sustainable. In many of these communities, especially those in the constituency I represent, people have felt neglected for years because there has never been investment or plans put in place to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> What we need now is development charges spent in a balanced way in Cork city. Last year, Michael Moynihan wrote about a city divided in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>. He stated that people in Cork's north side seem like second-class citizens when we compare the funding spent there with what is spent on the other side of the river. To highlight that, in 2022, the active travel funding saw 31 projects worth almost €16 million go to the south side but, on my side of the river, there were just 12 projects worth less than €6 million. That is €10 million less. Every single year, we see funding pumped into areas that have services, while other areas that badly need services do not get them.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">I congratulate the Minister of State and wish him well in his new role. It will be an interesting journey for him, I am sure.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. When looking at inner-city communities in Dublin, the neglect is obvious. Communities have been neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Flat complexes have been neglected. I was in Macken Villas, which is a flat complex not too far from here. The neglect there is obvious. Conway Court is the same. The neglect there is so obvious. It is hard to sum up the frustration felt by residents. They pay their rent, work hard and kept the front line going during the pandemic, yet they have been neglected for decades. If you look at Mercer House or Markiewicz House, you can see big glistening towers going up all around them yet rats are running around play areas. The tenants put in a simple request for gates - not a chance. Residents of Macken Villas are looking for the upgrading and even cleaning of the playground but no funding is being provided. Bartra has big developments right beside the flats, yet tenants see no benefit to them. People living in flats in Cuffe Street and Digges Street do not even have a small playground for toddlers. All they are looking for is a certain amount of funding, not all of it, to be ring-fenced to benefit the local community because they are the residents who are going to have put up with the noise, dirt and lack of light. It is a significant issue for them. They have been neglected for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I do not blame residents for feeling frustrated. A lot of protests are taking place. People are so frustrated because they have been neglected for years. It is inevitable. If I was living in Glovers Court, I would probably not pay my rent because the conditions people have to live in are unacceptable. The residents of Markiewicz House are looking for gates to provide an added sense of security, yet that is not tolerated, funded or supported. There needs to be a real commitment by local government and the Government to ensuring a certain amount of ring-fencing so that local communities will benefit from these huge towers and developments being built right on their doorstep.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> The old Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, site on Aungier Street will be sold for millions. It will be developed to the nth degree, yet local communities will not benefit in any way from that. I know residents have put forward a proposal. It makes sense that, as part of that development, there would be a public leisure centre because there is nothing there. Children looking to play football have no grass pitch in the area. Thousands of young children who want to be able to play football have to go to Crumlin to get training on a grass pitch or even a full-size astroturf pitch. It is really important that investment is made in communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I welcome the opportunity to speak on local government. Our councils are some of the most bureaucratic, overstretched and underfunded bodies in the country. They are a shadow of their former selves, with services being cut to the bone to the extent that a council tenant in Kildare with a smoking fuseboard was told on Monday evening that there was no emergency maintenance call-out available after 5 p.m. to assess and repair the damage. This is simply not good enough. What if a fire starts? What if something happens overnight? This must be addressed because it is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> We need to empower our councils to ensure they can collect all moneys owed to them. Kildare County Council is owed almost €13 million. We heard Deputies mention this to the Minister of State previously. This money is owed in development levies. It does not include the hundreds and thousands of euro owed in vacant and derelict site levies. That is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Kildare County Council is one of the better councils at delivering homes but it is not so good at delivering the necessary infrastructure. Much of this is the Government's fault, particularly around schools. A new secondary school in Monasterevin is due to open in the new few months. We have been waiting 20 years for it. This school will be oversubscribed on the day it opens. Other schools in Newbridge and Kildare town are bursting at the seams and the Government's answer is to move the heart of the Curragh community - its secondary school - to Kildare town instead of expanding it. It is also opening a badly needed new school in Kildare town. The Government is robbing Peter to pay Pauline and Peter and Pauline have had enough. They want to know what is going to happen with Kildare County Council. They know it is time to end the years of mismanagement. There have been successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments and it is time for a change.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I thank Deputies Joan Collins, Pringle and Connolly and their teams for this motion. It is a very effective and simple solution to the lack of basic community infrastructure across the country. The ring-fencing of development levies for amenities and material improvements is a common-sense approach that will help enhance localities and provide people of all ages with facilities to socialise and be active members of their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The lack of basic facilities, from playgrounds to public toilets and active infrastructure, is in some form or other one of the major issues raised by constituents. Towns and villages across west Cork are screaming out for amenities that are considered fundamental in other European countries. Playgrounds are one of the key examples. These should be standard in all areas but the only reason places like Innishannon, Bandon and Bantry have or will have playgrounds is due to campaigning and fund-raising by families. Public toilets are important for accessibility, families and tourism, yet many of our towns, villages and beaches lack them.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> A glaring issue is new housing estates being built with no consideration for the amenities that will be needed. Years later, some of these are provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The planning system does these things backwards. Community needs are an afterthought. Developers are left to do the bare minimum - to make as much profit as possible and then later the community and local authority will foot the bill for facilities. </p>
          <p eId="para_154"> If the Government took this motion seriously, it would transform communities across Ireland. Developers and local authorities would provide the infrastructure they need for people of all ages and capacities. It would also hold developers and speculators to account and address political clientelism. Amenities would be provided as a matter of course and not because of who knows who or who is in government. For this reason alone, it is likely the Government will never act on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> There is a significant disconnect between the residential planning process and the provision of basic community facilities in Ireland. Whole housing estates can be built in cities, towns and villages with no consideration for community needs, active transport links and the requirements of children, families, older people or people with disabilities. The reverence in which the Government parties hold developers means it would be unfathomable to ask them to provide these facilities. Then there is no link between the current levies for public infrastructure and community needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> It is common sense that if a new housing estate is built in a suburb, town or village, there will be new families which will put a strain on existing structures and lead to a demand for more facilities. It should happen automatically that community and sports centres are built or improved, active travel infrastructure is included, crèche facilities are added and potentially the local national school is expanded. However, in essence, this does not happen. The lack of joined-up thinking is disgraceful. It is a disservice to communities and a significant waste of public money. The easiest and most efficient approach is to add amenities during the design phase. Each development should have the principles of accessible and inclusive community facilities embedded in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Since the pandemic, the importance of local walking and cycling infrastructure has become even more clear. When a new estate is being built, the developer should be obliged to provide accessible active transport connections to the town or village centre. A guarantee of footpaths and cycleways benefits the whole community.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Healthy and strong communities are enabled through shared public spaces. Benches and good footpaths help older people get out and meet others. Cycleways help children get to school in a healthy and safe manner. Accessible public toilets are essential for family life and many people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> We all know the importance of these resources. I can ream off countless cases of where these amenities are needed in Cork South-West alone. They include new and improved playgrounds for Belgooly, Kinsale, Clonakilty and Bantry; operating public toilets at the Dock Beach, Long Strand and Ballineen; a glaring need for enhanced community centres and sports facilities in all major towns; and a significant absence of spaces for teenagers and young adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Too often, the communities themselves have to resolve these issues. All I can do is praise the people of all towns and villages in west Cork who have campaigned, fundraised and fought for community resources. The only reason Innishannon and Bandon have playgrounds is due to committed groups of volunteers. I have been working with people in Drimoleague and Kealkill who are calling for the most basic infrastructure to safely walk around their villages. Similar to many other areas, there is a significant traffic problem, compounded by poor footpaths and, although I was going to say poor road crossings, there are actually no road crossings. This severely impacts on the capacity of children to go to school by active means together, fostering good habits and independence. Older people or those with reduced mobility do not feel safe or confident going down to the post office or shop. Drimoleague residents are taking a proactive approach with the development of well-researched plans for the council to work with them on improving the safety and appearance of the area. Funding should be available for these projects as a matter of course.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> These cases represent the larger issue of public services in Ireland. Years of austerity and neoliberal policies have left State bodies and local government threadbare. Community facilities and safe infrastructure should be automatically provided. It should not be a matter of who shouts loudest or what funding scheme is available this year. Different groups in equal need are forced to run bureaucratic and logistical gauntlets in the hopes that they will be awarded funding. This is simply wrong. Unfortunately, this approach enables public representatives to exaggerate their importance. It facilitates clientelism and allows Ministers and Government Deputies to say they personally got funding for a project when the opposite is true. Over years, the Government parties have set up a system that does not require the provision of facilities when housing is being developed, nor is funding ring-fenced for community needs. The system they have created withholds investment in communities and, then when it is granted on an unequal and <i>ad hoc</i> basis, they claim success. It is hypocritical and more and more people are seeing straight through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> This is an extremely important motion. It goes to the heart of how community needs are consistently overlooked, disadvantaged areas are disregarded and our planning system is still geared towards developers and not ordinary people. Community amenities are not an optional extra or a prize to be given by the Government. They should be automatically provided to all urban and rural residents. Social and economic pressures are putting a strain on communities. Far-right agitators are trying to take advantage of these stresses. Local and accessible community spaces are more important than ever to foster community spirit and participation in society.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_33">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_163">I thank Deputy Joan Collins and the Independent Group for tabling this important motion. It is a welcome opportunity to discuss the impact of development on our communities across the country and the degree to which these communities are actually benefiting from the development that is occurring. We all understand that, as a matter of urgency, there has to be a significant development of housing. One thing that this motion points to is that the development that is happening is being driven by the profit hunger of property developers who see the housing crisis as an opportunity to make money. Consequently, we get development that does not particularly benefit the community or assist in addressing the housing crisis and where the stresses and pressures that that type of development then puts on communities actually reduce the quality of life and the environment of many in the localities in which those developments take place. Whereas they should be enhancing the quality of life and making things better for people, the opposite is often the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The last consideration is often precisely what the community needs. That does not just start with the development levies and how they are spent but with the development itself. I want to first point out that, given the scale of housing development that is needed and is hopefully likely to happen, in the areas where that development is occurring, we are not getting enough public and affordable housing in the various developments. The provision of 10% social housing is pathetic against the backdrop of the housing lists that we currently have. Even if we add in 10% affordable housing in new developments, that is pathetic. It means that in every private development, with private developers dictating what developments happen in my area and, I suspect, in most people's areas, some 80% of what is being developed is not affordable for ordinary working people. The only people who can buy properties are big funds or, sometimes, approved housing bodies, AHBs. I will come to that. By and large, they are buy-to-rent properties bought by big funds and rented at extortionate rates. The State often ends up paying the bill for them through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and housing assistance payment, HAP, even though the people who live in those places still do not have security in respect of where they live and often find themselves evicted further down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> The first thing I want to add to this motion is this. If we are going to have a serious impact on the dire housing crisis we are now facing, we need a much bigger proportion of every private development that is completed to go to social and affordable housing. To my mind, there is no point whatsoever in building unaffordable housing. What possible benefit does it serve? To give one example, we have been criticised for opposing some developments in our area. One example is the co-living development that is near completion in Dún Laoghaire, built by Bartra on a former school site. We have been campaigning for public and affordable housing there for more than a decade. It was bought by a property developer who is now completing a co-living development where there will be 200 rooms that are the size of disability parking spaces with pull-out couches. It will cost €1,800 a month to rent them and tenants are only allowed to rent for six months, or it might be extended to a year. In other words, it contributes nothing to the housing need of the area. Ordinary people affected by the housing crisis will not be able to rent those places. It begs the question of who the hell could afford that or would want such a development. That is the kind of development that is going on. It is purely profit-driven. That has to stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The quality of the housing is an issue. We have discussed the impact of the Celtic tiger on building defects. It may well be the case that the cowboy building of the Celtic tiger era is not behind us and is still going on. I will give another example. The Acting Chair, Deputy Devlin, may be interested in this. On Johnstown Road, a new development, much welcomed by many of the people to whom houses were allocated, was all bought up by an AHB. Within three months of the development completing, there is uproar among the residents over the quality of the build by the developers. Within three months, there is damp in the newly allocated social housing. Water is pouring into the underground car park. There is no lift in the underground car park, so people have to carry their shopping up two flights of stairs to get in, and there are issues for people with buggies or with mobility issues. There are major problems with the windows. The water going into the car park is also affecting the fire alarm system. Where the hell is the oversight of these developers who are still building stuff like that? It is unbelievable. That needs to be addressed and we need to stop the cowboy builders.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Another example relates to residents of a number of units near Deansgrange that were bought for social housing by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">People moved into Glebe Court thinking "happy days" because they had somewhere to live, but instead they have found that the place is wracked with damp because the heating systems are not working and there is no proper insulation on the doors and windows. People are literally shivering and freezing during the winter months. It is unbelievable stuff. These things need to be addressed by getting a proper share of the development levies to address them. Instead, it is as Deputy Mac Lochlainn said earlier. I was a co-host of the Oxfam event yesterday, as was Deputy Pringle. Where is all the wealth that Oxfam identified? It is in the hands of the new layer of multimillionaires and billionaires which Oxfam identified in its report. Often it is in the hands of the property developers and property speculators who built these substandard developments where these extortionate rents are being charged. They are profiting off the misery of communities through the extortionate rents associated with substandard building because we do not have proper planning and we do not have appropriate taxes to tax them to give people the community resources, the public services and all the things, including quality housing, that they deserve. I thank Deputy Joan Collins. I hope the Government will start to listen to the issues that are being raised here but I will not hold my breath.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">He has left now, but first I congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on his appointment. He was here earlier. I thank Deputies Joan Collins and Pringle and the group for bringing forward this motion. As a county councillor over a long number of years, I saw local development charges being hoisted and foisted onto people going in for planning permission for their houses, especially in rural areas. It always stuck in the craw that they did not know where this money was going to be spent. Often, you would be told that it was for the common good but effectively the public lights, the footpaths and all the other amenities would be in the town, not in the rural areas. The idea here is to recognise that when money is levered off people who are building their own houses, some of it should be spent in the local area for the enjoyment of the people who pay the money. It would help with many things, including rural schools where there are issues with set-down areas and safety outside the school. It could be spent on an area where a bus could pull in for children to alight rather than doing it on the side of the road. These small, very important safety works could be carried out with the help of some of this funding. Another issue is public lighting outside community centres in areas outside small villages which are in darkness at night time. It is a safety and security issue that public lighting would be provided in these kinds of places.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Many communities do a great amount of work across the country. Last Sunday in my local area of Caherlistrane, there was a senior citizens party in the local community centre entirely funded by local people. We have one next Sunday in Belclare. It is the same thing. These senior citizens parties bring out everyone in the community but we are funding it ourselves. It is important that recognition is given to the communities that are doing this kind of work. This is being repeated across the country. Great benefit is accruing to those who volunteer to do this kind of work. We need to ring-fence some of this development money so that it is spent locally. That is the key to the motion. The Government could direct local authorities to use all the development charges they take in for the common good, with a small portion, 20%, being retained within the municipal district in which it was charged. This is important because when a playground is put in, it takes money to maintain and upgrade it and ensure it is kept to the highest safety standards. Money is needed to keep these things sustainable. This is one way of doing it. We have an opportunity here and we should take it. </p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I believe the Government will not oppose the motion. I hope it is not like other motions which the Government does not oppose but instead confines to the bin. That is the Government's way of saying that it is done and moving on to the next issue. It is very important that this is treated right and that the local authorities and local groups have a say in how the money is being spent. Our local councillors would also have a say. That is where we are talking about local government and community involvement and also giving the benefit where it is most needed and local people know it is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">This is an important motion because it puts the spotlight on the issue of local government funding in this country. There are major problems with that issue in this State. Every county will have its representatives to focus on the issues at play in their own county. I want the Minister of State to focus on this particular issue. County Meath is particularly hammered by a lack of funding for a range of issues. This is because the population of Meath has increased incredibly over recent years but local government funding has not kept pace with the <i>per capita </i>increase. There are 220,000 people living in Meath. In practically every single investment sector, Meath is at the bottom of local government funding. Meath County Council gets 60% of the average local government funding <i>per capita</i> in the State. That is incredible. It has wide ramifications for a range of different issues. Meath has the fourth lowest number of local authority houses in the State. There are 22 counties, including County Longford, with more local authority houses <i>per capita</i> than Meath. Meath County Council does not have the money to build playgrounds, community centres and all the things you need for a proper community to function. Johnstown is one of Navan's biggest suburbs with 6,000 people living in it. It is about 20 years old but it has no playground. They have been campaigning for 20 years to get a playground there and it is still not built. A whole generation of people have grown up in Johnstown without access to a playground. It has no community centre. Young people have nowhere to go to have positive engagement with their peers. What happens when people have nowhere to go? They hang around the streets. They get involved in messing about the place and that causes difficulties for local communities as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Meath has the lowest investment <i>per capita</i> in mental health services, in residential rehabilitation for young people and for dual diagnosis. Recently the 24-hour mental health services were taken out of our county as were the headquarters of the gardaí. The Minister of State should find it important that Navan is the biggest town in the country without a rail line. It is promised in the new national transport plan but no money is ring-fenced for it. It is for a future government to decide whether to fund that project and that project is not planned to be built until 2031 at the earliest and maybe 2036. Everyone in this room will probably be retired before a rail line goes into one of the largest towns in the country. That funding has major negative effects on our society. Longwood has nowhere for its cub scout group to function. If the Minister of State could do one thing for us that I would really appreciate, it would be to equalise the <i>per capita</i> investment. We are not looking for more than anyone else; we simply want to equalise the <i>per capita</i> investment in local authorities around the country to ensure it reflects the population. There are many vacant public buildings that could be brought into community use. A school building in Longwood, which is owned by the State, has been vacant for some years and has been smashed up through antisocial behaviour. A cub scout troop in Longwood is looking to use it. We need to be able to be practical. We need some common sense in the use of the State and community facilities that we have in our counties.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">I welcome this motion brought by the Independent Group as it is asking for funding to be delivered to the county councils. How can we provide information for renewals and town plans if we are unsure of the basic infrastructure that is available in our areas? Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, there is a statutory mechanism in place for councils to use financial contributions. This covers roads, car parks and parking spaces. It used to cover sewerage, treatment plants and flood relief but I believe that now comes directly from the Department to Irish Water. How can we develop our towns and villages if the funding now goes directly to Irish Water but Irish Water is not upgrading our sewerage systems or water systems? That means we cannot develop our towns and villages. Then the money comes to the county councils through active travel. Active travel is being directed towards footpaths and cycleways, which does not cover our towns and villages because our towns and villages need access to the cities. I am looking for the funding to come back to our road infrastructure, sewerage and water. If Irish Water is incapable of providing us with the basics so we can rebuild our towns and villages, which would mean our schools would be covered and employment would be provided locally because businesses could open, the Government should dissolve it, give the money back to the councils and let us rebuild our towns and villages. That seems to be the major problem here. Irish Water is looking for developers to come along and give money to do a survey of sewerage systems, which was already done by the local authorities before it took it over. It is absolutely nuts. Get rid of Irish Water and give the money back to the people who know how to spend it.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I thank the Independent Group for bringing forward this motion on levies. Levies are always a contention. There are different aspects of levies but they are contentious for people who do not see the benefits of the levies after paying them. We all know now that levies, service charges and connection fees make up almost half the cost of building a house. This is stopping young fellas from building their own houses. It is costing €140,000 to €150,000 between levies, connection fees, VAT and you name it. This is stopping people. It is stopping small developers. Connection fees from Irish Water are exorbitant and it is costly for developers to put in a sewerage connection and water connections for a small number of houses. I have to talk about places like Scartaglin. It has no treatment plant. Myself and Tom Fleming were councillors at the time and we had Scartaglin up to number three on a list for a programme to be done and there it is still with no treatment plant. Likewise, Currow has no treatment plant. Those communities cannot develop or grow. Then there is Castleisland. I found documents belonging to my late father fighting for an extension to the sewer in Castleisland going back to 1986. Can the Minister of State imagine that? They were at it even before that. That is almost 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Then there are ridiculous things happening, like in Killarney where there is serviced land but it will not be built on because it is not in the current zoning. There is also a scenario where a local farmer who never asked for his land to be zoned has had it zoned and he wants to continue farming. There are things like that. There is a lot of talk about housing up here in Dublin and I do not mind people doing that but we have to fight our own corner. There are 171 vacant houses in the county of Kerry, going back two, three or even four years. If the Government is serious about building houses or providing houses for people, there are 33 houses vacant in Killarney. There are three houses vacant in Gneeveguilla, right around the circuit, and the Government is talking about building houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I thank the Independent Group for bringing this very important debate to the floor of the Dáil. At the outset, I want to give an example. Development levies are needed and we have to get money. I always used this analogy when I was on the council myself. An area I was very proud and am proud to represent for many years, both on the council and up here, includes Glencar, Beaufort, Kilgobnet, and that entire area. If someone put in a planning application and their house is above in Glencar, they will be told they have to pay a contribution perhaps for a playground to be built in Killorglin. That does not make sense for people in an area where they are not going to benefit from a service and where they are providing their own services. They are providing their own water, they are paying for their ESB connection and they are paying for the sewerage treatment. There is no footpath or public lighting. When people see a big development levy put at the bottom of their planning permission, it is hard for them to take that. Of course, if someone is in a built-up area and is getting services that is a different story. There has to be fairness in all of this. There has to be understanding in it. At present, that fairness and understanding is not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I have to take exception to one thing. I have heard this in here and you would get tired of hearing it. I will call out the words being used - "cowboy developers" and "cowboy builders". We cannot listen to too much more of this nonsense. We need builders. We need respectable people to build houses, whether they are building for us, for local authorities, for social and affordable housing or whether they are building private houses. We need more of them. We need developers. Being a developer is not a sin. There is nothing wrong with being a person who has the ability and brains to borrow money, buy land, build property on it and sell it. If you were to listen to some people in here, you would think you were some sort of an evil antichrist because you were a builder, you had a van and the ability to get up in the morning and build things and do things. My good God, if we were to rely on some of the people in here, we would starve of hunger, we would not have any place to sleep, no one would have a house and no one would have a roof over their head, or if the roof was leaking there would be nobody to repair it because these cowboy developers and cowboy builders would not repair it. You would get sick to death of listening to some of the politicians in here and the rubbish they go on with. If you were to follow them home, you would know they never did anything. If they were not here they would be nowhere because they certainly would not be working for a builder or developer anyway. We need those people in Ireland. Yes, there were wrong things done by some of them but my good God, they were not all wrong. We need small and medium-sized builders. In the parish I come from, we had small builders and developers who used to do or three or four houses and sell them. They used to work for the local authority. Many of them are gone to their eternal reward and God be good to them. They did a lot of good and excellent work. There is nothing wrong with being a builder and to be classifying them as cowboys is wrong.</p>

They are all very welcome to the House. There were a number of chuckles during the Deputy's contribution so I think there is agreement up there in the Gallery. I call the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_180">I also welcome the pupils and wish them a happy St. Brigid's Day. It is important to have robust debate and it is good to see such impassioned contributions in the Chamber. Before I close, I will try to reflect on some of the contributions made by Deputies since I came into the Chamber. Quite a lot of the issues raised were not particularly related to the motion but they are related to local government in general with regard to funding and provision of facilities. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issues of social and affordable housing and co-living and Deputy Canney spoke about public facilities, which is core to what we are discussing this morning. Deputies also spoke about the key role for elected members and I will reflect on that in my closing speech because there is a key role. I spent 16 very happy years on a local authority. The reserved function of the elected member in terms of the provision of facilities, provision of services, prioritisation in development plans and local area plans, play policies and other policies of local authorities is critical to the work of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The staff and executive of local authorities are carrying out the wishes of the elected members who set the policies. That is a critically important role that the elected member has at local authority level.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Deputy Tóibín raised problems with local government funding not keeping pace with population growth. There is no doubt that local government funding in general is a challenge. It is quite exciting that the Government is embarking on the Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill 2021. That will help in terms of the funding in general. I will reflect on that in my closing speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Deputy Tóibín also referenced putting public buildings back into use, as did other Deputies. We have provided local vacant homes officers to 31 local authorities. They use the Town Centre First initiative, which will have a Town Centre First officer. We are putting infrastructure and resources into local authorities to build capacity to unlock the potential in vacant dwellings and vacant properties. The vacant homes fund was announced by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, last week, and the Croí Cónaithe fund is also available. There are myriad really good funding regimes and policies to support the regeneration of our town centres to get these buildings back into productive use. That is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Similarly, Deputy O'Donoghue raised issues around active travel funding, the need for which has never been greater. I am absolutely conscious of the issues around rural Ireland and in particular the expansion of Local Link services. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made an announcement about hackney services, which is a game changer in terms of the interconnectedness of rural public transport. I absolutely share the concerns raised by the Deputy in that regard. It is critically important that our smaller rural communities are connected and feel connected, which is what the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Wastewater infrastructure was raised with regard to Irish Water, which brought in the small town and villages growth scheme. The Government has invested significant capital moneys in Irish Water to meet its capital objectives around the provision of safe drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities for the expansion of our smaller towns, villages and settlements. That is reflective of some of the comments I heard since I came in on the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I thank the Deputies for their engagement this morning. We have listened carefully and with interest to the contributions that have been made on this important topic, which is very much alive in our growing towns and cities. As has been mentioned by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the motion put forward by the Members from the Independent Group today is in many respects aligned with Government's overall approach to supporting growing communities through the provision of funding to support amenities and services that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> It has already been said, and it is clear from the motion, that it is in everyone's interest that proper planning and development ensures that community services and infrastructure are funded as and when such new development arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> This Government shares that interest and supports existing measures to achieve those aims and objectives. Furthermore, this Government is progressing additional measures to further support what could be best described as community gain that must arise from such developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has already shared with Members an outline of the existing measures that are in place and those proposed measures that are in line with the spirit of the motion today, which is that the uplift in funding derived from new developments should benefit those affected communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> This Government will continue to support those existing arrangements, although it recognises there are opportunities for more to be done in this area. The Government recognises the need for additional infrastructure and for community gain to be secured in connection with new housing development.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Perhaps the most radical changes in this area for decades are contained in the proposed land value sharing mechanism. This is intended to increase the sources of funding available to local authorities to enable them to benefit from any value uplift that arises from development.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill also includes provisions to empower local authorities to designate areas with significant potential for development, including housing, as candidate urban development zones and for the Government to designate such areas as urban development zones. I very much look forward to seeing this Bill progress when it is published in the coming weeks. The potential benefits for local authorities and communities would further strengthen the linking of community gain from future housing developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The proposals already outlined also make it clear that they include a key role for elected members and the local community in the adoption of a framework for the development of the area within the development plan, and in the adoption of detailed schemes for the master-planning of the areas. Such empowerment of elected members should be welcomed and supported and I would welcome support from Opposition Deputies as this Bill progresses. That is also critically important to state.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> As we go through development plan processes throughout the country, it is critically important that communities are and continue to be engaged. Local authorities are striving to increase the level of participation in our development plan process. We really want communities and young people to have a say in how our development plans progress. It is vitally important that everyone is able to have a say. The young people present in the Public Gallery will be inheriting the plans and decisions we make today and into the next decade. We want to ensure we future-proof them for their generation as well. It is, therefore, really important that people participate in such public processes. During my time as a local authority member, I really valued that role of people being engaged. I value the role the elected member plays because he or she is the conduit between the community and the executive of councils and how plans and policies are shaped and formed. That is vitally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Finally, in not opposing this motion, the Government recognises that there is work in train to deliver the general objectives contained in today's motion. As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, stated, it is aligned with the spirit of Government policy concerning the channelling of revenues arising from development that is already well established and in addition to the work that is also under way to develop this funding principle further.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> As the Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill progresses through the Oireachtas, I urge the Deputies who proposed today's motion to support its passing. Ultimately, this new innovation will help to deliver additional funding available for the development of community facilities and amenities, which we can all agree are essential in housing development.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Private Members' business today. It has been really useful to have this debate. It is very progressive and the Government will not be opposing the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Yes, I will only take as much as I need. I thank everyone who spoke on the Private Members' motion. It really reflected the difficulties that communities are having with regard to large developments being built in their areas. I agree with Deputy Pringle that it would have been better if the Government had voted against it or tabled an amendment to it because the communities would have seen their demand for 20% of development levies to be put into the communities in which these developments are being built taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I want to make a point again about Drimnagh. Much work by the community went into the Dynamic Drimnagh plan. They put it into the Dublin city development plan and went right through what they saw was needed in areas in their community. They are the people who know what is needed in their community. They have not received any money for any improvements to their community. Two major developments are going on, one of which is built and the other of which is being built on the former Eason's site at Brickfield. That will bring in €11.5 million in development levies, which is going directly into the city. I know it is used for general things. Does the Minister of State know what that community is getting, however? They were looking for tea rooms in Brickfield Park and for the pavilion to be developed with showers for the footballers and toilets. Does the Minister of State know what they are getting? They are getting €500,000 for the pavilion despite all this development going on around them. They are absolutely angry and annoyed. They have done everything right. They have gone to the area office and to Dublin City Council. They met with representatives with responsibility for parks and all these different areas. They have done everything right and yet they do not have the money coming into the area to try to develop it. That is a very dangerous thing from the point of view of the Government and local authorities. When people feel isolated and they do not see anything coming back into the community, they get very disenfranchised and question the whole idea of local democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_201">The object of the motion is to bring local democracy into the community where the community has direct relations with their elected representatives. We should use 20% of development levies in the same way as the discretionary funds are used in local areas, where issues can be identified and decisions made as to where the funds should go. </p>
          <p eId="para_202"> In response to some points made by the Minister of State, the Government states it is confident that new plans will address and provide community gain in areas such as Drimnagh. It is not only Drimnagh of course, but other areas across Dublin city such as Finglas, Cabra and so on. Why would people in Drimnagh believe that this is going to happen with any new plans when they have been losing out for years? The money has not been going into the community. Since Drimnagh was established in the mid-1930s, there has been no serious investment in the area. The community has been asking for facilities for years but this has fallen on deaf ears. In particular they were looking for Brickfield Park to be developed and they got €500,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Section 48 and 49 provide funding for public infrastructure such as roads, water treatment, parking and so forth. Deputy Pringle made that clear. However, that it is not going into the community or for community gain. In a rational world, water, parking and roads would already be planned for and funded by the local authority capital programmes. That is what the local authority is supposed to be there for. Existing legislation takes money that is needed in communities and diverts it to fill holes left by the Government’s refusal to properly fund local authorities. The land value capture and urban development zones could be positive but they are market dependent. It is not a cure-all for this problem. Government proposals do nothing to address the unequal distribution of funds and give no guarantee of money in the areas that need it. This money needs to be put in the hands of the communities and their elected representatives as they are the best people to know what the communities need. Although great work is done in local authorities the fact is that the little funds they have, having been cut back so much, are dispersed using a top-down model and used to fight fires left by gaps in Government spending. In my experience on the council, councils are not trusted with purchasing power. The only area in which councils have power is through development plans. Even in that process many of the proposals put forward by local councillors are gone by the end of the third phase of the development plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Sufficient funding is not provided for community or discretionary spending. There is no community gain because no money is provided for it. There is real inequality in where these funds are going. Drimnagh has been allocated €500,000 for the Brickfield Park dressing rooms. The community was originally promised a refurbished pavilion and dressing rooms as well as a tea room. Merrion Square park will get €3.4 million for a tea room but Brickfield Park in Drimnagh will not. This area has received €11.5 million in levies recently and will receive another €45 million in levies over the next three years, but the park gets €500,000. The levy collected from development in the area is high. There is a clear need for local ring-fencing to ensure communities get the funds they need from the funds raised in their local areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_205"> For years the communities have been left out following years of austerity, under-funding and neglect and years of what little funds there were being unevenly distributed. Councillors and their communities deserve a say and deserve funds to shape their own areas. Community gain has come solely from the hard work of people in these communities but needs funds to effect the change needed to face these new developments. The current system of local authority spending is like a Band-Aid instead of real Government investment in working-class communities. If the Government is committed to giving these communities proper positive change and proper services, it should stop publishing plans and reports and just give them the money. Section 48 (2)(c) of the Planning and Development Act should be amended to instruct local authorities to distribute 20% of the levies from construction projects in the local area where the housing is being built in order that the community and its elected representatives can deliver that money into the areas it is needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_206"> There are currently 12,500 people living in Drimnagh. These developments will double the population; we have facts and figures on this. However, the area has no library, primary care centre or community centre. The St. John Bosco Community and Youth Centre is nearly 60 years old. It is on public land yet no money being pumped into it. It has deteriorated so badly that it cannot be redeveloped and, therefore, a new site must be identified for it. Dynamic Drimnagh has to come up with a plan for that and do a land swap. The park is abandoned again with just €500,000 for a pavilion out of the moneys coming from the development levies. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not table a countermotion because then there could have been a real debate on this issue. I am cognisant of the fact, looking at my WhatsApp messages at the moment, that people from the Dynamic Drimnagh group are watching this debate. They see what the levies are being spent on and are becoming angry. They are asking who they should contact and which Minister they should contact in regard to this because they want something done about it. The most direct way would be to give 20% of the levies to the communities in order that they have a say in where that money goes to ensure it goes where it is needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I thank my personal assistant, PA, who helped to draw this up. He came on board in January; my former PA retired in December. Putting this together involved a great deal of work so I thank him for that. We will be back about this issue. Communities will demand that some of those levies should not go to the top level of Dublin City Council but rather that they go to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Hello to everyone from Ballymun in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Yesterday he Taoiseach admitted to the Dáil that he was, in fact, briefed on Government legal strategy on nursing home charges. This was 24 hours after he stated that he was not involved in the strategy and sought to put distance between himself and it. Not only did he admit he was briefed and that his predecessors and successors in government were also briefed, but he also stated that he stands foursquare behind this plan, this strategy. His expressed view is that this was, and is, a good Government strategy - a heartless plan designed by Government to hardball elderly, vulnerable people and their families forced to pay nursing home charges they should not have been paying; a strategy to stop them getting their money back, to prevent them from vindicating their rights and to keep things quiet.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Last night, we learned on RTÉ's "Prime Time" that another cold and heartless Government strategy was in place to remove allowances - the disability maintenance payment - from people with disabilities in residential care. This was a Government decision that was deemed to be unlawful. The documentation from 2009 shows that the Government of the day knew that these citizens were entitled to their allowance but used their vulnerability to prevent them from getting their payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> This was another political strategy put in place to stop ordinary people wronged by Government from taking their case to court. Why was this? The view of the Attorney General at the time was that the State would be unable to defend these cases successfully and so, another strategy to conceal, to deny, to cover up and to protect the Government instead of protecting vulnerable citizens. In fact, this secret document set out that a comprehensive trawl of all of those who had been illegally stripped of their disability maintenance payment should not be done because, it said, “such an exercise would be unlikely to escape media attention or speculation and could generate further claims which otherwise would not have been made”. Worse still, the Minister for Health of the day and, indeed, the entire Cabinet, endorsed this strategy. Of course, it was endorsed again by the 2011 Government, of which the Taoiseach was part, because it was reflected in the memo I discussed with him yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The story of these Government strategies is a sordid tale of successive Governments involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the late Progressive Democrats actively working against the interests of some of our most vulnerable citizens. Families were forced to use private nursing homes because of the failure of Government to provide places within the public system. These families were ripped off, with many forced to work into their 70s to just get by, in some cases on less than €30 a week. Now, we see a mirror image of this political strategy adopted by Government after Government against citizens with disabilities who are dependent on the State to look after them, to vindicate their rights and to protect them. These were citizens, many of whom lived in sheltered environments and who may not have had the capacity to initiate their claim. All of this has caused real hurt, real trauma and real hardship for many people; people who needed the Government to stand up for them instead of Governments facing them down and fighting them tooth and nail, at every turn, to deny them things they were entitled to. The human cost has been heavy and deep.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Does the Taoiseach believe that this Government strategy set out in a memo from 2009, and used against people with disabilities, was a legitimate strategy for Government? Is that a legitimate Government strategy? Does the Taoiseach stand by that? Does he call this also a good plan and a good strategy from Government?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_220">I still cannot fathom why the Deputy always feels the need to misrepresent what I say in this House and what the Government says. Obviously, I stand over what I said yesterday in regard to me being briefed and I am still trying to get the documents around that. What I can say is that regarding a document that appeared in the newspapers yesterday in relation to 2016, we have confirmed from the Department of Health that I was not circulated on that document, and on the agreement between the Minister and the Attorney General's office, AGO, I was not the Minister who made that agreement; it was a 2014 agreement. As the Deputy may know, when civil servants talk about “Ministers”, they often talk about "the Minister" in the context of the corporation sole, not necessarily the person who was the Minister on the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> However, that does not matter; that is just a sideshow. What matters are the issues the Deputy is raising now. In regard to the historic nursing home charges issue, I want to emphasise once again that it does not relate to anyone in nursing homes today or, indeed, in recent years. That is an important point of clarity that people in nursing homes today and their families will want to know. It relates to charges prior to the 2005-06 period and those matters were resolved prospectively when the nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal, was introduced by the Minister, Ms Harney, back in 2009. That created a universal system that sets out how people are entitled to nursing home care and what contributions they need to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The State - the taxpayer - has compensated those who had paid charges in public nursing homes to the tune of €480 million. That was the right thing to do, and it was done. In regard to private nursing homes, the situation is different; it is more complex, and that was explained at the time back in 2006. We do not accept that medical card patients ever had an unqualified entitlement to free private nursing home care. The advice from successive Attorneys General is clear that that is not an accepted position.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Even to this day, medical card patients either choose or are forced to go privately, and we do not reimburse them for their costs. Where we do pay for medical card patients to go privately, there is a system in place of prior approval. That is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> It was never the intention of the Government or the Oireachtas to confer a right to free private nursing home care on medical card patients. That is clear from the debates in the Dáil if the Deputy wants to look back at them. That does matter. What the Oireachtas intended and what Government policy was do matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Some cases have been settled with a financial settlement, but others have been settled without a financial settlement, and some cases were not settled at all, because they had been managed on a case-by-case basis pending a test case, which has never happened. There will be a report from the Attorney General on this to the Cabinet next week and I know the Department of Health is keen to report on it as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> In relation to the other matter the Deputy raised, which is the disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA, this was paid between 1973 and 1996 under the Health Act 1970 by the former health boards. I am advised that the allowance, which could be and was used for food, heating, electricity, rent and so forth, was paid to people who could not provide for themselves. The policy position at the time - this is going back to the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s - rightly or wrongly, was that this money was no longer required as the individuals were living in State-funded residential care and those needs were being met. People with a disability who were resident in long-term care facilities did not receive this allowance after the first weeks in residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> In 1996, the allowance was renamed the disability allowance and responsibility for it was transferred to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, as it was called at the time. Since 2007, it has been paid in full to people with disabilities living in long-term care, so this matter was resolved 15 years ago. However, the question that arose in 2009 was whether there should have been retrospection and back pay. It is an historical issue, a legacy issue, but to me it does appear different from the nursing homes charges issue. It appears different in substance because the legal advice is different and the legal advice and position became clearer after the High Court ruling.

          <p eId="para_228">Yesterday, the Taoiseach expressed incredulity at what was suggested. Here are his words so that I am not accused of misrepresenting or misquoting him.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_229">The allegation here is very clear. It is that four or five Governments, four or five Attorneys General, any number of Ministers and former Ministers, some of whom are now in the Government and some in the Opposition, and dozens of officials all conspired to deny people refunds they were entitled to. That is as far-fetched as it sounds. It is not what happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">That is exactly what happened. It happened in respect of preventing those who had been illegally charged in nursing homes from going to court, having the matter adjudicated and getting their money back. It also happened in respect of these citizens who, by the way, were entitled to that allowance. It was illegal. It was judged to have been <i>ultra vires</i>, illegal, for the State to deny those people that money. Again, the same strategy was used to keep it quiet, say nothing and not to raise the hare. The worst aspect of it is that government after government, knowing that the State had wronged and denied people things to which they were entitled, colluded and conspired in a strategy to ensure that people could not have their rights vindicated. Where is the compassion in that?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">On Sunday, it was illegal charges to older persons in nursing home care over the course of three decades. Last night, it was the removal of disability allowance payments, the DPMA, from up to 12,000 vulnerable people in institutional care. Perhaps tomorrow we will see yet another story of a group of people being failed by the State. However, this is a much bigger story. The real story, as we see it, is the pervasiveness of what amounts to a callous legal strategy. In essence, the State approaches litigation against it in a manner indistinguishable from any faceless corporate entity. It is a war of attrition against those who dare to sue it. The route is well worn. People are denied legal rights unless they sue the State. If they do litigate, the cases are defended by the State and then, late in the day, prior to making discovery and certainly prior to going into trial, those with the resources and patience to keep going receive a settlement to avoid the setting of an adverse precedent that others could rely on in future. It happens everywhere. We have seen it in special educational needs cases, immigration cases and medico-legal cases against the State. It is also in the approach taken to those excluded from State redress schemes, such as those who have been subjected to sexual abuse in some schools, and to those affected by the Thalidomide scandal, on whose behalf I have been calling for a redress scheme for months. Again, this is a legacy issue that must be resolved by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> It is darkly ironic that we are debating this issue today in anticipation of the debate later this afternoon on the mother and baby homes scheme, a redress scheme that is certain to exclude large swathes of people who were victimised by church and State throughout the last century. The context changes, but the results stay the same. People who can endure the cost and stress of years of litigation will get their legal rights, but those who cannot afford that, will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Taoiseach has described this as a "legitimate legal strategy" but, rather than the vindication of rights, this is a "cost-containment" strategy, which takes priority for the Government. I have seen this in operation as a barrister where I acted for children from disadvantaged communities who were at severe risk of harm and who had been deprived of the care and support they needed. The only way to get the support they needed was to sue the State and show a readiness to go to trial. That is no way to treat vulnerable people who are being let down by the system. Those children who did not litigate did not receive any supports. The Judiciary was highly critical of that. This must be a watershed moment to see how we can ensure a change in Government policy. We ask the Taoiseach to call on Secretaries General of all Departments to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to attest to the legal strategy in place in each Department as regards litigation against the State. Is that initiative something the Taoiseach would support?</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Second, would he support a re-evaluation of the role of the Attorney General to ensure he or she must take into account the common good or public interest as well as the more narrow financial interests of the Government of the day?</p>

          <p eId="para_253">It is very easy to lump all these different cases and issues together and say they are all the same. They are not. They are quite different. For example, when it comes to the nursing home charges issue, the legal advice from the Attorney General is very different from his legal advice on the DPMA.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I am coming to that. I have been a member of three governments now, including a Government involving the Labour Party. We have put a huge amount of time, care and resources into putting right some of the wrongs of the past, even where there is no legal liability on the State. We have put in place a compensation scheme, for example, for symphysiotomy. In that case, the survivors went to court and they lost their case. Even though they lost their case in court, the Government decided anyway to set up a compensation scheme, which we did. Another scheme that we set up was for the Magdalen laundries, and we are setting one up for the mother and baby institutions, mica and pyrite, and apartment block defects. There were no findings of liability at all against the State in those cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">They were not fought in court. On the contrary, we decided to set up schemes to help those people because we thought that was the right and just thing to do. How the Deputy is characterising this is not fair. She is taking a few examples and extrapolating those to every issue that has arisen. That is not fair at all. We set up those compensation schemes because they were the right thing to do and not because we lost, or were at risk of losing, court cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The Government has a responsibility to do what is right and just. We also have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer and the common good. We cannot spend the same euro twice. We want the education budget to be spent on educating children and young people today, we want the health budget to be spent on people who are sick and need medicine today, and we want the budget for children to be spent on children who are vulnerable today. If too much of today's budget is diverted to fixing the problems of the past, that has consequences. Governments and Ministers have to strike a balance between the future and the past. We try to strike that balance as fairly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">The Taoiseach's response indicates exactly the point I am making, namely, that the Government of the day is not merely another defendant and it is not appropriate for any government to act simply as another corporate defendant. The Government must of course, as a democratically elected government, reflect and respect the rights and wishes of the people and the common good. That is precisely why the Labour Party is calling for reform of the Office of the Attorney General. This is not only in order for the Government to review the State's litigation strategy to ensure that the State and the government of the day are acting in the common good across all the cases where people have been done injustice and where people deserve redress. We are also asking, in order to guard against future similar litigation strategies being adopted against similarly vulnerable groups of people, for a review of the role of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> We are preparing a Bill that will not only ensure that the Attorney General's office will take regard of the common good and the public interest, as well as the narrow interest of government, but will also look at the publication of the advice of the Attorney General in specific cases. It is not always appropriate for the Attorney General's advice to remain confidential or for the person holding that position simply to act as if he or she is a lawyer advising a private client. The government of the day has a duty to reflect the wishes of the people and to act in the common good. The Taoiseach has acknowledged that and it is precisely the point I am making.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I acknowledge that it is the role of the Government to act in the common good. We may disagree on what the common good is from time to time. I accept it is the responsibility of the Government to act within the common good, which is why I do not accept this charge that has been made, namely, that the Government only does the right thing when it is dragged to court or loses a court case.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I have given the Deputy several examples of cases where the Government put a redress scheme in place, even though the case was lost in court. Symphysiotomy is one example of that. The Government also decided to put in place compensation schemes in respect of mother and baby institutions, Magdalen laundries, mica, pyrite and apartment block defects, despite the fact that there was never a finding against the State with regard to those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> What is the common good? The common good has to take into account what is right and just. It also has to protect the taxpayer and look at what is the broad common interest. Yes, we want to put right the wrongs of the past but we need to bear in mind that there are demands now and for the future. With the best will in the world, no matter what the financial position is for any Government, it can only spend the same euro once. As much as possible, we want budgets to be spent helping people who need that help today. That is the judgment call people have to make.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">People wishing to avail of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which provides tax relief on the purchase of specially constructed or adapted vehicles for someone with a disability, are being rejected at community level and then left waiting for an appeal date due to the inaccessibility of a sitting board. To qualify, applicants have to obtain a primary medical certificate via assessment at community level. It does not take a medical qualification to know that the language used for the six criteria is highly restrictive and excludes many people with genuine, severe and permanent disabilities from accessing supports. When deemed ineligible at the community medical officer level, people appeal the decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, DDMBA, the board of which is made up of medical practitioners appointed by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> We need a scheme that looks at disability in terms of functions rather than pathology. We should ask about a person's level of function and what the person needs in the vehicle. They should qualify on that basis, whether they are autistic, epileptic or a stroke patient. We need to look at a graded system of support. Some people need big adaptations, such as a special vehicle in which a wheelchair can be placed as they cannot drive themselves, while others just need a specialist seat or a swivel seat. It does not have to mean a big benefit to everybody who qualifies for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The Government recognises the need to ensure that there are accessible transport options and appropriate mobility supports for people with disabilities. The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme provides relief for vehicle registration tax and VAT on an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant. The scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or passenger and to certain charitable organisations. In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a primary medical certificate issued by the relevant senior area medical officer or a board medical certificate issued by the DDMBA.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The DDMBA is expected to be re-established shortly, following the resignation of all members of the previous board in late 2021. Following three recruitment campaigns, five candidates have now been nominated by the Minister for Health and have just completed their Garda vetting. Department of Finance officials have held two meetings with the nominated members and are in contact with the National Rehabilitation Hospital about recommencing the appeals process. The disabled drivers scheme has been reviewed as part of a broader review of mobility supports carried out as part of the work of the national disability inclusion strategy and transport working group. This working group is under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte. It held several meetings last year. A draft report was considered at its final meeting on 8 December and is currently being finalised. We expect it to be published soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I accept has dragged on for far too long. We want to make meaningful progress on it in the very near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I thank the Taoiseach for his response but I remind everybody that three schemes were operating at one time. The other two schemes were suspended in 2013. It is now 2023 and these schemes have not been replaced, even though it was indicated at the time that alternatives would be devised. I understand that since December 2021, three previous members of the DDMBA have participated in a subgroup to review the disabled drivers and passengers scheme set up by the Department of Finance, lending their experience and expertise to devise a new and fairer scheme. My understanding from departmental officials is that it is agreed that its review will come under the national disability inclusion strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Will the Taoiseach please clarify the current situation as regards applicants for the board? As I said, 400 people are on the waiting list, which is not fair. A constituent came to my office last week who is in a very serious position in respect of this issue. I ask the Minister for Finance please to get the board up and running as soon as he can. These people need help. It is not a massive amount of money. They and their families all need a little help.</p>

We will see if we can come back to him with some more details. It has taken longer than anticipated to recruit the new board. We hope the board can make inroads into the backlog over the next couple of months. As the Deputy said, there are three different schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The disabled drivers scheme has been reviewed, and we are waiting for the publication of the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, before deciding what steps should be taken next. The Department of Finance recognises that the scheme is no longer fit for purpose and is not in line with best international practice. We want to make sure there is a new scheme that works for people.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">Under the programme for Government, Ireland is projected to plant 450,000 ha of forestry between now and 2050. That is about 1.1 million acres. In 2023, with all the debacle that has gone on with forestry over recent years, farmers, if they want to apply to plant trees, cannot do so because the Department will tell them that it is waiting for state aid approval. Along with that - this seems to be the week of leaked documents - in Europe a document from the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development, DG AGRI, was leaked which had on its cover a note to top civil servants not to carry it in public, to use encrypted software and, if at all possible, to shred it if anyone sees it. In that document the Commissioner states that there will be major problems under the proposed rewetting or the nature restoration project Europe has proposed. DG AGRI has stated that there will be major problems under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, major problems for farmers and major problems for the farm-to-fork strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> A few months ago, I brought this up here and talked about approximately 800,000 acres that have been proposed in Ireland. There is also a proposal under the nature restoration law relating to 70% of drained peatlands. When I talk about drained peatlands I am talking about the likes of Listowel, where the black and white cows are up and down the field, and a lot of the west of Ireland, where farmers of sheep and suckler cows earn a living on parts of their farms. If this proposal comes to pass, it will decimate a certain part of the country. If what I have talked about is totalled, it is at least 2 million acres. That 2 million acres will go from the top of Donegal down to the bottom of Kerry or out to part of west Cork. It will come out to the midlands. It definitely will not, however, touch the Golden Vale because there are no peatlands there. It definitely will not touch the Hill of Tara, good land in Kildare or a lot of other parts of the country. It will, however, affect small family farms in the areas I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Is it not worrying to the Taoiseach that a Commissioner has a secret document internally in the EU that states very clearly that there are major problems under CAP and major problems for farmers? Politically, this is a hot potato, and still the Taoiseach, as leader of the country, and his Government are now supporting this document or the proposal on the nature rewetting law. Will he or his Government put a halt to what is going on for the sake of the small family farms in the areas I have outlined?</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the EU nature restoration law. We support the European Green Deal and support in principle the proposed EU regulation on nature restoration law. It was published by the Commission in June 2022 and aims to restore nature and biodiversity. The proposed regulation in its current form, however, is very ambitious and goes too far, and we have real concerns about the real challenges that would be posed by its impacts, timing, equity considerations and deliverability. Each relevant Government Department has been asked to undertake as a priority an analysis of the likely sectoral impacts in order to inform a coherent national impact assessment, including the economic cost arising and the impact on farmers and farm families and rural communities, particularly along the western seaboard. Formal negotiations on the regulation began under the Czech EU Presidency and are now continuing under the Swedish Presidency. The expectation is that the regulation will be ratified by the European Parliament and the Council in the middle of this year. Under current proposals, the regulation, once ratified, will come into force and member states, including Ireland, would have two years to prepare a national restoration plan. We would therefore have to have that plan prepared by 2026.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">The Taoiseach said first that the Government supports the proposal, and then he said it has grave concerns. If it has grave concerns, how is it that every other country, including the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, has written back already and most of the countries in the EU have written back opposing this in is present form? Why have we not written back and outlined the things in it that the Government is concerned about? We had representatives of the Directorate General for Environment, DG ENV, before our agriculture committee last week. They are not concerned about the Government doing an analysis in Ireland. They made very clear to us at the committee that they had taken an overall look at this. When we asked them what the consequences of this will be in Ireland, they said they look at it on an overall basis, not country by country. We are unique in this regard. I ask the Taoiseach to put a halt to what is going on. The Government should not ratify this or the Taoiseach and his Government will be the cause of small family farms in the west, north west and south west of Ireland being driven out of business on account of this. There is time for the Taoiseach to act and I ask him to do so.</p>

I think all of us want to see nature restored, an end to biodiversity loss and the restoration of biodiversity across our country. There are, however, aspects of this that are very ambitious and go too far, in my view. We are carrying out a national impact assessment so we are developing a position on the EU nature restoration law. It is being led by the National Parks and Wildlife Service but is cross-government. An interdepartmental group has been established, as has a senior officials group, and there will be a memo to the Cabinet very soon setting out the Government's position on it. Of course we will have regard to the impact on farmers, farm families and rural communities, particularly down the western seaboard. I appreciate the concerns the Deputy has raised in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">The Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues were advised in a secret memo in 2011 that the withholding of the disabled persons maintenance allowance from people with disabilities was illegal. In the words of the memo circulated to the Taoiseach and the Government, the regulations were "plainly <i>ultra vires</i> and void". The State had not, as the Taoiseach said, a leg to stand on and, therefore, a strategy was pursued to keep these matters under wraps and out of court. Given that the State did not have a leg to stand on and that the withholding of this allowance was illegal and wrong, why did the Taoiseach do nothing about that? How is it that, 12 years on, he continues to deny these vulnerable citizens what is rightfully due to them?</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Later today, the Dáil will debate the redress scheme for survivors of mother and baby homes. Like me, the Taoiseach, I know, will have received countless emails from those who are concerned that, despite public assurances, many will be excluded from the redress scheme. To quote from today's <i>Irish Examiner</i> article by Conall Ó Fátharta and Elaine Loughlin, the proposed scheme "heaps abuse upon abuse" because "it excludes 40% of survivors", in their words, "and denies healthcare [rights] to two-thirds". There were early overtures from the Government to my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, that the Department would provide redress to those who had spent fewer than six months in an institution, but those plans, it seems, have since been abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Will the Government make public the method used to devise the eligibility criteria for survivors and will the Taoiseach explain why that six-month limit has been retained? Given recent reports about a lack of transparency in Government strategies, this sort of transparency is owed to survivors of the mother and baby homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Picking up on something the Deputy said earlier, the Government is putting in place a scheme to compensate people who were residents of mother and baby homes, despite the fact that nobody has found any legal liability attached to the State in that regard. There was no question of court cases, legal strategies or any of those things. The Government decided it was the right thing to do to have a compensation scheme in this, regardless of any points of law. A commission of investigation was established and it recommended a redress scheme. There was also an interdepartmental group which recommended a redress scheme. The Government decided to go beyond that and set up a more generous and far-reaching scheme than was recommended by an independent body, and that should be recognised. I know the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will comment on this later.</p>

The responsibility for that is being felt by each of us in all of our constituencies and constituents are looking to us for answers, including people who have come here seeking answers on their safety. Too often we are operating on the basis of innuendo and rumour and too often we are firefighting. It is not fair that we continuously have to contact one Minister, who answers our calls when he can, to seek answers to questions. It is time for a cross-party committee like the former Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, with each of us having responsibility to engage with the issue and collaborate because nefarious far-right groups are stepping in to take advantage and generate fear. I want to work collaboratively on this and to show leadership. I understand the pressure on the system so I ask the Taoiseach to set up a cross-party committee where each of us can get involved in this issue and show leadership, both in this House and in our communities.

A lot of work is being done on the new national ant-racism strategy and that should be ready in the near future. On the particular issue of an additional committee, that is something the Business Committee could consider.

Unfortunately, this is a pandemic of violence and last year was one of the worst years we saw for the numbers of people affected. Some 15 women were killed nationally and the vast majority of them, about 87% it is estimated, will have known their killers, either through being a partner, a former partner or a family member. They are not refugees or unvetted men; they are people known to those whom they kill. We still have nine counties without a single refuge space and we still have less than one third of what the Istanbul Convention tells us is required for refuge spaces. We still need reform of the family courts and we still have an inadequate sex and consent training education service for national schools. We need to deal with all of these issues urgently. They cannot wait until laws are passed and the strategy is rolled out. There are things that can be done now and in particular we should provide those extra refuge spaces.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">On 10 November last I raised the case of Una, who is a 66-year-old pensioner. Despite working all her life she is in receipt of a non-contributory State pension and she has been refused a medical card because she receives a net income of €1 per week on top of her pension for the rent of a field. Her next-door neighbour gets €11 per week extra because the neighbour is in receipt of a contributory State pension and qualifies for the medical card. This anomaly arises because the income limits for the medical card have not increased since 2005. The basic rate of social welfare in that period has gone up by €71.20 and Una has been denied a medical card because of an additional income of €1. At the time I asked the Taoiseach when the medical card income limits would be revised and he gave a commitment to take it up with the Minister for Health. I would like the Taoiseach to update the House on when we will see modern and updated income thresholds for the medical card.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">The nature of any means test is that there will always be people who are just a few euro above the threshold. No matter where the threshold is set that will unfortunately always be the case. I acknowledge the point the Deputy makes, that the income limits have not increased in a very long time and have not taken account of inflation or rising incomes. However, the number of people who qualify for a full medical card is 2.095 million and an additional 535,000 people qualify for GP visit cards. Money was provided in the budget to increase the income limit with respect to GP visit cards and the person the Deputy mentioned would qualify once they are implemented, at least for a GP visit card, but that is under discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation.</p>

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, says it is not the Government's preferred option. Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity on Thursday to talk to President Metsola about the rules of engagement on grants paid down to Coillte? Will he also deal with Coillte and the way it is mistreating farmers? There is unfairness in the licensing situation such that Coillte got 90% of the felling licences last year and the farmers who we are expecting to grow this timber have been locked out of it completely. This is a rotten deal and it should be reversed. No rule has ever been made that could not be changed or broken. It might cost money and I am not saying we should dishonour something but we must change our ways because there is huge anxiety and anger building over this sale of our land. We are celebrating our forefathers who fought to free this country and we are doing this kind of deal and we will have Cabinet investigations later on. We should deal with it now and back out of this disgraceful, shady and pro-British deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">In recent parliamentary questions I highlighted a situation where recently approved recipients of stamp 4 status under the regularisation of the long-term undocumented persons scheme are being precluded from Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, on the basis that many are unable to prove that they have been in the country lawfully for three of the five preceding years. It is an anomaly in what is otherwise a laudable scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I hope the Taoiseach can look at addressing this issue as it is casting a shadow over what is otherwise an excellent scheme that reflects positively on this country. We have many young people. In particular, I am dealing with a family with three children of university age who are anxious to further their education and will make a valuable contribution to society. However, a quirk in the SUSI rules is precluding them from advancing. I am hopeful it is something the Taoiseach will take on board and try and address for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">When the Taoiseach was Minister for Health in January 2015, he said he was sick to death of the overcrowding problems in our hospitals. That month there were 631 people treated on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, UHL. Last month, January 2023, there were 1,080 people in need of a bed while they remained on trolleys in UHL. I wonder if the Taoiseach is still sick of it. Under the watch of the Governments of which he has been a member since 2011, the numbers in UHL have got worse and worse. There has been much inactivity and many statements of intent but when the chips are counted, there has been no improvement in these metrics. They have got much worse. I ask the Taoiseach to take hold of the situation and push for the speeding up of the two new 90-bed units which it is hoped will address part of the problems at University Hospital Limerick for patients and the hard-working healthcare professionals who work there. Two weeks ago, as the Taoiseach will be aware, 11,000 people marched through the streets of Limerick looking for changes. What can they expect from the Taoiseach today?</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I thank the Deputy. On the issue of emergency department overcrowding in general, we have made a lot of progress since the early part of this year when we saw record numbers of people being forced to wait on a trolley for a hospital bed. We see now, and have seen for the past couple of days, that the number waiting for a bed is running at a lower level than was the case this time last year. That is in part due to the extra beds, the extra staff and the extra investment that has been put in.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> As the Deputy will be aware, a 96-bed unit is under construction in Limerick. I am keen to get that done and open as soon as possible. Increased use is being made of Ennis and we would like the same to be the case in Nenagh and St. John's as well. Plans are being advanced for a further additional block in University Hospital Limerick, which I accept is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I want to bring awareness to the campaign by hairdressers throughout the length and breadth of Ireland to keep the VAT rate for their services at 9%. It is an issue nationally. If one looks at west Cork, one sees a perfect example of how a change in the VAT rate will negatively impact the industry. There is a healthy number of excellent hairdressers throughout west Cork and they play such an important role. As the Taoiseach may well know, west Cork is the wedding capital of Ireland and hairdressers play such an important part in that whole package. Unfortunately, an increase in VAT will impact the viability of these hairdressers. It is also safe to say we all want more affordable haircuts. It is something that should be revisited.</p>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided that the concessional VAT rate of 9% will go back up to 13.5% at the end of February. That was a cost-of-living measure. However, we will have to make some decisions at Government level in the next week or two on what measures we might be able to extend. We cannot extend them all but we will try to extend some of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes by providing them with access to high-quality regulated home care. The lack of home help support is adding to the chaos in some hospitals in rural areas. The chronic shortage of millions of home help hours means that doctors are delaying the discharge of vulnerable elderly patients. The issue here seems to be the lack of enticements for people to work in the area of home help. The people who currently work in the sector do not have pensionable occupations or proper rates of wages and regulation. It is now time for the Government to put home help on a statutory footing so that it is enshrined in legislation as a sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I thank the Deputy. As he will be aware, we are putting record amounts of money into home care at present. The problem is no longer the money; it is finding staff who are willing to work in the area. We have plans for a statutory home care scheme. We have opened up the work permit system for home carers to come in from abroad and work in home care in Ireland. We have not yet seen the impact of that because it is relatively new. I will ask the Ministers of State, Deputies Richmond and Butler, to examine whether we should have an employment regulation order for home carers. When we did it in child care, it created a salary scale, terms and conditions and benefits that have made child care more attractive as a profession. Perhaps the same principle might apply in home care as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">There have been 84 independent reviews and investigations carried out by the HSE into acute and community operations since January 2019. The HSE took over the running of Dealgan House during the Covid outbreak where 23 people died. Will the Taoiseach support them and insist and ensure that they get closure by having an independent investigation into why these deaths occurred and why the HSE took over the running of that home? It is essential that it happens. On the question of costs being too high, which has been repeatedly put forward here by the Minister, if we can do 84 independent reviews for €622,000, the families believe we can do one into the deaths in Dealgan House.</p>

I support an independent inquiry into the State's handling of the pandemic, not with a view to pointing fingers but with a view to getting to the truth, understanding what happened and learning lessons for the future. We are scoping that out at present. It will go beyond any particular nursing home or beyond health. It has to cover the economic response and other things too. We will have to see, as part of that inquiry, if we can look at particular sites, not only Dealgan nursing home but others too, and how that can work out.</p>

It was clear from listening to the moving and, at times, harrowing testimonies from families, nursing home residents and staff that there is an overwhelming need for a human rights-based inquiry into what happened in nursing homes during the pandemic. Families, including those from Dealgan House, want the truth about how and why their loved ones died. When will the Government announce a timeline for such inquiries?</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is similar to the issue that Deputy O'Dowd raised earlier. I would hope to have a public inquiry into the response to Covid up and running this year, ideally by the middle of the year, but it needs to be scoped out. It will be extensive. It could go on for quite some time. We are keen to get it right. I extend my profound sympathy to the families of people who died in nursing homes. Covid was a difficult time for all of us, but particularly hard for those who could not mourn their loved ones properly or be by their side during their last days. We need to recognise that in the vast majority of cases, if not all cases, people working in and managing nursing homes did their best in what was an unprecedented scenario. There was no handbook as to how one manages a pandemic. I believe that in almost all cases, people did the best they could.</p>

The Government chooses not to oppose Opposition motions as a tactic when it does not want the political fallout from having to vote against them. Our motion included a raft of solutions to improve children's access to mental health supports and to reduce waiting lists. It was also about transparency and accountability within the HSE. Can the Taoiseach guarantee that the Government will implement the motion completely as we do not want to see our children being used as a political football?</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I will raise the issue of the 9% VAT rate. It is important that the Government makes a decision on this as soon as possible. I emphasise how important it is to so many small businesses, especially in my constituency where tourism and hospitality make up a significant part of the economy. Many other services such as hairdressers also depend on this appropriate rate of VAT. I would not longer refer to it as a concession. It brings us in line with competing countries in Europe in the area of tourism and hospitality. I ask that a decision be made on this soon and that the decision be to retain the rate at 9%.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">We plan to make a decision on this before the middle of this month in order for people in business to know where they stand for March and the spring. Two measures are in place for businesses at the moment that are valuable to them, namely the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, to help with energy costs and the 9% VAT rate. We need to work out what we can continue and what we cannot. The Deputy must bear in mind that none of that was budgeted for. There will be costs for anything we extend beyond the end of February. However, we acknowledge that businesses need ongoing support with their bills.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">I raise the issue of the TBESS. I understand it is constantly under review. Recently released figures show that approximately €20 million has been drawn down from a fund of almost €600 million that was allocated to support businesses. That shows that the current system is inaccessible or the criteria are too stringent. I have examples and many Deputies across the Dáil also have them. One business had a bill of €15,000 for November-December 2021 and it increased to €56,000 for the same period in 2022. Unfortunately €5,000 or €10,000 towards that kind of rise helps but does not go a long way. I understand the scheme is under review but we need a dramatic overhaul of the TBESS and how we roll it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">As the Deputy is aware, the scheme is currently being reviewed by the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Coveney. The Deputy is correct to say that the take-up is much lower than we anticipated. The current plan is to end the scheme at the end of February but we are now looking at the possibility of extending it because energy prices are still very high for businesses. We are also looking at changing the terms and conditions. We still have not quite figured out why the take-up is not what we thought it would be. It may be because people simply have not applied for it, because it is too hard to qualify or because the limits are too low. That is all being examined at the moment.</p>

Why were the members of the firearms expert committee, FEC, not interviewed? Why has there been not been any meaningful consultation with national organisations representing those who take part in sports involving firearms? Do the Minister of State and the Taoiseach believe it right and fair that law-abiding citizens who apply for firearms licences must do so under criminal justice legislation? Given that we are part of the EU, will the FEC review the firearms licensing systems and legislation in place in other European countries prior to making recommendations to the Minister? It would make more sense than constantly referring to the US system which cannot be compared to the Irish one, except to say that they are polar opposites. It is an unfair comparison to use and depicts a negative image of those who hold licensed firearms in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I have just received the figures for the active travel funding that was announced today and they are absolutely shocking. I raised this issue last year. I will give some detail. Last year in Cork 31 active travel projects worth €16 million were funded on the south side of the city and on the north side of the city, 12 projects worth €6 million were funded. That is €10 million less and 19 fewer projects. It was announced today that 42 projects worth €14 million will be funded on the south side of the city and 22 projects worth €6 million will be funded on the north side. The average cost is €336,000 for projects on the south side but only €282,000 on the north side. I will ask a question on behalf of the people of Cork North-Central. Why are we being treated like second class citizens when it comes to funding on the north side? It is the same every year. The figures are there. They stand for themselves. Deputy Varadkar is the Taoiseach. Will he explain this to me so that I can go back to my constituents and tell them why the north side is being neglected and why the Government is doing it?</p>

          <p eId="para_349">I appreciate the disparity the Deputy has outlined. The short answer is that I do not know. I will need to ask the Minister for Transport to revert to the Deputy on it. Sometimes the reason is the projects that are put forward. I am not saying that is the reason. It is the responsibility of the local authority to put forward the projects. They cannot be funded unless they are put forward. It might be the case that the projects put forward were not strong enough or that there were not enough projects put forward for the north side of the city. I honestly do not know if that is the case. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come back to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">I raise with the Taoiseach what appears to be an increase in the number of people who have died this winter and last winter compared to previous years. In its analysis, the <i>Irish Examiner</i> indicated that there is an increase of up to 20%. From my conversations with people in the medical professions, undertakers, priests and others, I know that they concur that there is an increase in the number of people dying.

          <p eId="para_352">Yes, my attention has been drawn to it and I have seen the analysis in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>. It seems there has been an increase in excess deaths this winter relative to other winters. It seems it is a phenomenon that is not unique to Ireland. It is an international one. I have asked the chief medical officer, CMO, for her opinion and advice on it. The likelihood is that it is related to a number of factors such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, and Covid-19 all circulating in the community. People's immunity is not what it was due to social distancing throughout the pandemic. People's immunity is not as strong as it would have been if they had been out and about picking up viruses. There is also the issue of unmet health needs - as large parts of our health service were effectively closed down during the pandemic restrictions, people did not get the healthcare they would otherwise have received. That is all only opinions at the moment. We do not have any data to back it up and I have asked the CMO for her thoughts on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_368">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> On 12 January I visited Belfast where I had constructive discussions with the leaders of the main political parties. The main focus of the meetings was on restoration of the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland and on the EU-UK negotiations on the protocol. I emphasised the Government's commitment to assist efforts at Executive formation, to get the Assembly functioning and to see the North-South Ministerial Council operating again. We also discussed concerns around the UK legacy Bill and the proposed new electronic travel authorisation, ETA, which is problematic for third country nationals resident here and for tourists. We also noted the forthcoming 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in April. </p>
            <p eId="para_370">I concluded my trip with a useful meeting with the Northern Ireland Brexit business working group, which reiterated the value of consulting with the business community on any new approaches.</p>
            <p eId="para_371"> I had a substantive call with the British Prime Minister on Monday, 23 January where we discussed a range of issues, including restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. We also discussed the ongoing EU-UK negotiations on the protocol and our shared wish to strengthen British-Irish relations. We both recognised the importance of the ongoing engagement between the EU and the UK on the protocol, and I welcomed the more constructive nature of the current discussions. I reiterated the need for a solution that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland and protects the integrity of the Single Market. It is important that these talks can now take place in confidentiality with a view to reaching joint solutions on these issues. We also spoke about the positive co-operation between the EU, UK and the US in respect of the war in Ukraine and I took the opportunity to acknowledge the UK's leadership role in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> During my call with the Prime Minister, I reiterated the Government's concern about the UK's legacy legislation and the impact of the proposed introduction of electronic travel authorisation on third country nationals travelling across the Border. The Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in ongoing contact.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_373">I thank an Taoiseach for his reply and I welcome the fact that he has had engagement with the political parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government. I also welcome that an Tánaiste and other members of the Government attended the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in mid-January. All those meetings are important, particularly in the absence of the North-South institutions functioning.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> I was in Belfast with other Fianna Fáil parliamentary colleagues in early January. Among the people and groups we met were political parties; Wave Trauma, which is a powerful organisation that advocates for victims of the Troubles; Linda Ervine and the east Belfast Irish language group in the East Belfast Mission; the Greater Shankill Partnership; and Paul Doherty of Foodstock community homeless hub in west Belfast. There was a clear message from all those groups that they want the institutions and the Assembly back up and running. They want the Executive in place and the North-South bodies functioning as designed and agreed in the Good Friday Agreement. From speaking to many businesses in my neighbouring counties north of the Border, I know they want any outstanding issues relating to the protocol resolved as soon as possible. Any interruption to trade in Northern Ireland is a disadvantage for us as well. I sincerely hope progress can be made in resolving outstanding issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> On the legacy issues, since I last spoke on Northern Ireland issues in this House, I attended a solemn and appropriate commemoration in Belturbet on 28 December last to mark the 50th anniversary of the Belturbet bombing. That is one of the many legacy issues that has not been resolved. Neither the O'Reilly or Stanley families have got the truth about who carried out that heinous crime which killed two young teenagers: Geraldine O'Reilly and Paddy Stanley. There are other instances in my constituency of such issues that need to be resolved. Those families know the chances of getting a prosecution are slim but the least they deserve is the truth. The present British Government proposals are absolutely unacceptable.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_376">I am glad the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss several important issues with the new British Prime Minister, including the full implementation and effective operation of all the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and the British Government's legacy Bill. The war in Ukraine was among other issues the Taoiseach discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> The appointment of Rishi Sunak has set the relationship between Britain and Ireland and it is clear these relations have improved significantly. Will the Taoiseach bring the House up to date on the protocol issue and the restoration of the political institutions in Northern Ireland? RTÉ's European editor, Tony Connelly, tweeted this morning that EU sources are denying a report in the London <i>Times </i>that a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol has been struck between the UK and the EU. It was noteworthy that the Taoiseach suggested last month that mistakes had been made on all sides in the handling of Brexit and that the post-Brexit protocol might be too strict.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> He was in Belfast last month for talks with the main parties in Stormont. Does he believe the agreement reached on EU access to UK customs and IT systems is significant? Can he say where we are at now as regards the technical negotiations between the UK, and on the protocol issue? I appreciate the parties to the negotiations need time and space. He may not want to, but will he also comment on the report in the London <i>Times</i>?</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_158">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_379">Across the UK today, more than 2 million workers are on strike, including teachers; rail workers; higher-education workers; people who work on border checks in the North; and University and College Union, UCU, members. This follows a series of strikes by health workers. Some of the key issues driving this huge revolt of working people are issues they have in common with many workers in Ireland, namely pay increases that are, in effect, pay cuts because of the spiralling cost of living.</p>
            <p eId="para_380"> When one considers the recent report by Oxfam, about which there was a briefing this week, which identified the fact that if the absolutely extraordinary growth in the wealth of the very richest people, the millionaires and billionaires in this country, was modestly taxed it could raise €8 billion in extra revenue, it could be used towards paying decent wages to workers, addressing the housing crisis and public services. Oxfam is arguing for this internationally. When one looks at the strikes and the cost-of-living crisis and how it is impacting on nurses, teachers and healthcare workers in Ireland, as well as in the UK and across Europe, will the Government look at taxing the wealth, which has seen extraordinary growth, the very richest people are enjoying and using it to address the cost-of-living crisis that the vast numbers of workers struggling to pay the bills and rent are facing?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_159">
            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_381">We have a very impressive display of workers' power in Britain today, the largest co-ordinated strike action in more than a decade, with teachers, train drivers, civil servants and many others withdrawing their labour. In the North, UCU members working in higher education are on strike, a strike that is about pay and the investment in the future of higher education. The workers have realised that serious and militant strike action is the way to go after years of a series of one-day, intermittent strike action. In the North, that comes after a wave of strike action involving hospital staff and a coming wave including teachers, firefighters and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_382"> Is the Taoiseach concerned that workers in the South may look to the North, and across the water, and say that they need to use their power here too, they need to prepare the ground to take on the idea of a 24-hour general strike, and they need pay increases that are at least in line with inflation to stop people losing out and their incomes being reduced?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_160">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_383">I thank the Deputies for their questions. I will start by responding to Deputies Haughey and Brendan Smith on the Northern Ireland protocol. I welcome the continued positive UK-EU engagement aided at finding joint solutions to concerns about the implementation of the protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_384"> When I met the Northern Ireland parties and business representatives last month, I got a real sense of a widely-held desire to see a joint resolution and to refocus on other pressures facing people across Northern Ireland, including the cost of living and resolving the various strikes under way. As I said to President von der Leyen, when we spoke on 11 January, the approach taken by the European Commission is the right one. The Commission has listened carefully to people in Northern Ireland and is willing to show flexibility in the search for an agreement. I also discussed the protocol with Prime Minister Sunak, when we spoke on the phone on 23 January, and expressed my belief that it should be possible to find joint solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_385">I said that I was encouraged by the constructive nature of the discussions and I believe both sides want to reach agreement. The best support we can offer them is to provide the time and space for them to get there. I can confirm that notwithstanding newspaper reports, no deal has yet been done between the EU and the UK but I agree with Deputy Haughey that the agreement on customs information is significant and helpful. </p>
            <p eId="para_386"> Regarding the UK's legacy bill, I very much endorse Deputy Brendan Smith's remarks on Belturbet and agree those families deserve truth. There might never be prosecutions, although I would never like that to be ruled out, but what they want and deserve is truth - to know what happened and who did it. The Government continues to communicate its deep concerns about what is happening and the unilateral approach by the UK Government. I raised this directly with Prime Minister Sunak during our call last Monday and with the party leaders in Belfast recently. The Tánaiste raised it with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin on 19 January. There is consistent opposition to the Bill across the board and that continues to grow. </p>
            <p eId="para_387"> I am very aware of the strikes in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. I make a point of watching British news any day I can. Listening to the Deputies opposite, they almost sound as though they are glad the strikes are under way and are sad that they are not happening here, notwithstanding the impact they have on people who use public services. A trade union leader once said something to me with which I really identify. I recall him telling me that any strike is a failure of industrial relations and that while it is easy to go out on strike, it is much harder to settle a dispute because that means having to sell to your members something that is less than what they have been demanding. I thought that was a pertinent comment. That was not from me; it was from a trade union leader. </p>
            <p eId="para_388"> There are very big differences between what is happening here and what is happening in Great Britain. For a prolonged period, we had pay rises that were higher than inflation. We do not have that at the moment but we have a public sector pay deal that at least goes part of the way towards compensating workers for the rising cost of living, while in Great Britain, they are effectively back to austerity and are increasing taxes and reining in public spending. Because we have managed the economy so well and because the public finances have been managed so well, we are in a very different position and have been able to reduce income tax and put in place cost-of-living measures that have helped soften the blow. However, I hear the concerns workers have that prices are rising faster than wages. I acknowledge that this is a problem but the best way to resolve that is by negotiation with unions, not strikes. Strikes are a failure of industrial relations. </p>
            <p eId="para_389"> I did have a chance to look at the Oxfam report. I acknowledge that it is based on net wealth instead of gross wealth. That is something I am glad was clarified. I heard the Deputy use the term "modest tax rates". My reading of it was that it was proposing tax rates of 60% or more. I do not think most people in the country would regard a 60% tax on anything or anyone as being modest. The biggest risk of taxes of that nature is they drive people, wealth and investment abroad. That is why wealth taxes generally have not been successful where they have been tried.</p>

            <p eId="para_399">I heard the Taoiseach's responses earlier on the nursing home charges scandal. He defended the strategy that has been pursued by successive governments not to give people what they should be entitled to in respect of the huge outlays they have for nursing home charges. He defended that position and said the Government has never conceded the obligation to pay these charges. If that was the case, why did the Government need a legal strategy at all? Why did it have to settle with people? Why was there a memo stating that we had better keep these settlements quiet in case other people become aware that they would have a legal case against the Government for the refund of nursing home fees they had paid?</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> Does this scandal not highlight the systematic policy on the part of a Government that is willing to give €64 billion to banks and bondholders and do anything to resist taxes on the rich such as the proposed wealth tax while denying ordinary, often very vulnerable, people who have suffered at the hands of or been let down by the State, whether it is the Brigid McCole case, CervicalCheck, the nursing home fees scandal or the mother and baby homes redress scheme we will discuss later where tens of thousands of people will be denied redress they should have as survivors of these homes, because the Government is penny pinching and creating arbitrary criteria to deny them the things they deserve to protect the interests of the wealthy?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_163">
            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_401">Yesterday it was elderly people in nursing homes while today it is people with disabilities living in institutional care centres - another day, another scandal involving the conscious abuse of State power to defraud the most vulnerable people. Rather than caring for these people as the State is legally obliged to, a decision was repeatedly taken at the highest level to rip them off.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> The Taoiseach said earlier that the State did not have a leg to stand on legally when it came to people with disabilities. The rip-off took place in two ways - first, through not paying them disability payments to which they were legally entitled and, second, by covering that up and adopting the same hush-hush, settle out of court legal strategy used with nursing home charges. </p>
            <p eId="para_403"> The Taoiseach was forced yesterday to admit he was personally implicated in the nursing homes scandal along with pretty much the entire political establishment over the past 50 years one day after saying he had nothing to do with it. The case of disability payments encompasses the period when the Taoiseach was Minister for Health. Is he personally implicated in this plan to defraud tens of thousands of people with disabilities? Will he take the opportunity to apologise to these people and their families as a first step to ensuring they receive every penny to which they are entitled? If he accepts that the State did not have a legal leg to stand on, why was this strategy pursued?</p>

            <p eId="para_404">Is any Cabinet subcommittee examining how investment funds are buying homes? The Government has defended the role of investment funds and their special tax treatment citing the need to attract investment to build new housing. However, new research by Pierce Daly shows that more second-hand homes have been bought up by investment funds than new builds. This pushes up the price of housing as funds compete with individuals and families for a limited supply of housing. The narrative that funds have been mainly involved in financing new builds is simply not true.</p>

            <p eId="para_406">In the past two days, the Taoiseach's position on the unlawful charging of citizens and their families in nursing homes has gone from one of utter denial to one of admitting that he may have been briefed. Nobody will be surprised at this because this is the<i> modus operandi </i>of the Government. It denies that it happened then admits that it did happen but downplays the significance, then finally it admits the significance but urges everybody to move along. The Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications are members of Cabinet who received a memo. It outlined how thousands of vulnerable people were unlawfully denied their disability payments and included a strategy to continue this wrongdoing. The Taoiseach was at pains this morning to downplay the significance of this and highlight that it is historical. However, it is not historical. It is the Government's responsibility here and now to do this. It is much more reflective of other things that have happened that the Government has sought to do similar with.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> Not two years ago, the Department of Health was compiling secret dossiers on children with autism if they were taking a case against the State. We are all acutely aware of the devastating outcomes of the CervicalCheck scandal that still looms large for so many women and their families. Bullish responses help nobody and, therefore, my questions are specific. Have the three coalition leaders discussed these memos that relate to the charging of nursing home fees and the unlawful withholding of disability payments? Have they been provided with copies of those memos and the related documentation? If not, have they asked for them? These are matters that the Taoiseach needs to get a grip on today, in real time. Finally, will the Taoiseach agree to the publication of these documents?</p>

            <p eId="para_408">I thank Deputies for their questions. On the historical nursing home charges relating to private nursing homes, I emphasise again that this does not relate to anyone who is currently in a nursing home today or who has been in recent years. It relates to charges prior to the 2005-06 period. The matter was resolved prospectively when the fair deal scheme was set up in 2009, which is the legal basis by which anyone can receive a place in a nursing home and sets out the contributions that they have to make towards that, if any. The State and the taxpayer have compensated those who paid charges in public nursing homes at a cost of €480 million. That was the right thing to do. It was done at the time. The situation with private nursing homes is different. That was explained at the time in 2006. The Government does not accept that medical card patients ever had an unqualified entitlement to free private nursing home care. Even today, medical card patients who choose or are forced to go privately do not get a refund. Where we pay for private care for people with medical cards, it is done by prior agreement. There is a system in place. People cannot just bill the Government after the fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_409"> It was never the intention of the Government or Oireachtas to create such an entitlement, which is clear from the debates at the time; that matters. Some cases have been settled; others have not. We await a report from the Attorney General. The legal strategy has been misrepresented and memos have been selectively quoted. It is clear from the memos I have seen, though I am sure I have not seen them all, that the strategy was to identify a test case or lead case and to defend it. The State sets out what its <i>bona fide</i> defence would be. There are three lines of defence. Any one of them would have been adequate. As I mentioned, some cases were settled but not all. That was done on an individual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> The issue of the disability payment is different. The legal advice is different and much clearer. I have not seen the 2009 memo. I just saw the programme on "Prime Time" last night. I have seen the 2011 memo but only recently. I will look into it further. As I said earlier, this relates to prior to 2007. The disability allowance has been paid in full for the past 15 years to people with disabilities and in long-term care. It relates to the period before that. That is significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> The three coalition leaders have discussed the nursing homes issue, as has the whole Cabinet. We have not discussed the issue of the disability payment yet but I am sure we will. I would caution people not to read memos in isolation. There may be many different memos and briefing documents that might provide a different picture of things. I caution people not to selectively read or selectively quote memos. Government memos can be 50 or 60 pages long. It is easy to take out a sentence or paragraph and create a particular impression from that. When the memo is seen in totality, with all of the other memos that came before and after it, the situation may look very different. I know Members know that deep down, although they might not want to bother with that. They will all have files or documents in their offices from which one paragraph or page can be taken that would not create an accurate impression of what the entire file looks like. I know Members know that and it does not suit them to know that, but they know it.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> On tax on investment funds, the Government keeps all tax matters under review. There are finance Bills every year. I am not at liberty to say what might be in the Bill, but it will become clear when it is published.</p>

            <p eId="para_416">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> I spoke by phone with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday, 10 January. President Zelenskyy extended new year's wishes to the people of Ireland and expressed his appreciation for the steadfast assistance and friendship shown by Ireland and the Irish people to Ukraine over the past year, and to the more than 70,000 Ukrainians who have received refuge and protection in Ireland. I assured President Zelenskyy of Ireland's continued solidarity. I also confirmed to him that Ireland will continue to stand with Ukraine, now and throughout its path towards EU membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_418"> We discussed Russia's despicable attacks on Ukraine's civilian population and energy infrastructure. The President said that in the face of and despite this brutal aggression, the people of Ukraine remained strong and determined that Russia will not win its war of aggression. I said that Ireland had been pleased recently to help with equipment to repair Ukraine's electricity grid, and to provide budgetary assistance to the Government of Ukraine to meet essential needs and services, including during this winter period.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> President Zelenskyy raised his ten-point peace formula and looked forward to Ireland and other international partners' co-operation in implementing a peace plan when conditions allow. In that context, I affirmed Ireland's solidarity and our desire and determination to see the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence, and for holding those responsible for the war to account. President Zelenskyy also extended an invitation to me to visit Ukraine at a future opportunity.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_168">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_420">On that last point, does the Taoiseach intend to visit Ukraine? Perhaps he could let us know his views on that, having regard to the invitation. As we know, 24 February marks the first anniversary of Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the support and solidarity given by Ireland and the EU to Ukraine has been rock solid, and rightly so. In his phone conversation with President Zelenskyy on 10 January, the Taoiseach discussed Ukraine's initiative for a just peace. It is up to Ukraine to decide on the terms, conditions and timeline for such a peace agreement. I am interested to know how Ireland might assist with this proposed peace plan. I understand that it covers issues such as accountability for war crimes, food security and matters surrounding nuclear safety, among other things. I take it that Ireland is supporting the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute these war crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> Under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, it is proposed to provide military training to Ukraine. Ireland's expertise in this regard is in clearing land of mines and the management of explosives. This will still be an issue when the war ends. Perhaps a report could be presented to the House, outlining how Ireland can assist President Zelenskyy's initiative for a just peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> On a related issue, there are fresh reports regarding the possible need to introduce amending legislation to defence Acts so that protection can be provided for our ambassador in Kyiv.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">Maybe this is a matter for the Minister for Defence but if the Taoiseach knows anything about this in relation to promised legislation, I would appreciate if he would let me know.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_169">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_424">I noted that those in the Dáil for Leaders' Questions stood for a pause for peace. It is a very good thing that people would stand up and call for world peace. When we look at the horrific conflict that is taking place not only in Ukraine but also in Yemen, Syria, where we have seen the horrors, and many other parts of the world, I do not really understand how we can stand for peace and call for a pause for peace, on the one hand, but there is no sign from the Government of what is supposed to be a neutral country of our actually urging peace in the terrifying conflict taking place in Ukraine. The despicable character, as the Taoiseach called it, of Putin's invasion is beyond question. He is a tyrant, a warmonger and a bully and what he is doing is wrong but that does not mean that continually escalating the war is the solution because it has reached a terrifying level. As I mentioned last week, the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, which was set up by Einstein in 1945, has stated the clock towards nuclear annihilation is closer than it has ever been since the end of the Second World War. It is 90 seconds to disaster. That is where things seem to be going. President Zelenskyy is looking for tanks. Then he wants F-16 fighters. Where does it go? Is the Taoiseach worried about the possibility of this escalating to a nuclear confrontation which would be a disaster for everyone? Should Ireland not use its voice to call for de-escalation?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_170">
            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_425">Does the Taoiseach have any concerns about the largest weapons transfer in history being made by NATO forces into Ukraine? This escalated in the past week in the decision to send heavy tanks in the form of M1 Abrams from the US and Leopard 2 tanks from Germany and other European countries. Precisely as Deputy Boyd Barrett indicated, the logic of this is to have further and further escalation. Now the demand is that the only way to use these tanks very effectively is to have F-16 fighters in the air. The things that were previously said by western leaders about containing this conflict within certain realms, not going for an air conflict with Russia, for example, over the ground of Ukraine, are now being discarded. Is the Taoiseach not at all concerned that this leads in an extremely dangerous direction which could end up in further escalation by Putin, who is responsible for the brutal, bloody and imperialist invasion if Ukraine, into nuclear conflict? That is something that all of humanity must be extremely concerned about.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> The winners here are not ordinary people in Ukraine or anywhere around the world but the armament manufacturers. If we look at their profits, General Dynamics, which makes Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles, increased its profits in the final quarter of last year by 15.5%; Ratheon Technologies, maker of Stinger and Javelin missiles, doubled its profits in the last quarter of 2022; and Lockheed Martin also significantly increased its profits. They are the big winners out of this. Is the Taoiseach not concerned that these dealers of death and destruction are profiting from this massive drive to militarisation and massive expansion of military budgets, not ordinary people?</p>

            <p eId="para_427">I would like to visit Ukraine. I have never had the opportunity to visit that country and would very much like to do so. I am connected to it now in a way I never was in the past given that someone from Ukraine has been living with me since May 2022. I have come to learn a lot about the country and its culture and would love a chance to visit at some point. I would particularly like to be able to visit a country that is at peace. If the opportunity arises, I will travel to Ukraine to show our support and re-emphasise our solidarity but no dates have been agreed or discussed at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> President Zelenskyy make me aware of his ten-point peace plan which I have looked at since we spoke. It is very good but realistically I do not think it is something that Russia would ever agree to. Ukraine will have to regain more, if not all, of its territory before the prospect of a cease-fire or peace arises. The way we can achieve peace is for Russia to withdraw from the territories it has occupied. That is not something the Deputy should be blasé about.</p>

            <p eId="para_430">Calling on someone to withdraw from occupied territories is something they should do. We want to get the embassy in Kyiv up and running, have the ambassador there and have it functioning again. There are some issues around security. I do not know the details of that but I know the Tánaiste is working on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> I absolutely agree that escalation is not a solution but what is the alternative? Is it to allow Russia a free hand to massacre the Ukrainian people, occupy their capital and take away their freedoms and democracy? I know the Deputy is not saying that but it not the case that anyone thinks escalation is a solution. Weapons are being provided to Ukraine because if they are not provided, the conflict will escalate anyway. Russia will enter the big cities and will do in those cities - Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa - exactly what it has done in the cities it has occupied. It is not a choice between escalation or de-escalation. Russia will escalate this war anyway, kill more civilians and commit the most heinous atrocities. The reason weapons are being provided to Ukraine is to hold Russia back. That is the impossible choice that countries bigger than ours are now making.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> I want to be very clear, however, that we do call for de-escalation. We want Russia to cease fire, stop its advance, stop the missile attacks and air strikes on civilian targets and pull back from the territories it has occupied. That would put us in a different place. I do not think western governments would have to provide additional armaments to Ukraine if that were to happen. It is important that we never allow anyone to doubt that all of us in this House believe that Russia is the aggressor. I know the Deputies opposite are not supporters of Vladimir Putin or the Russian regime but I think it is important that in their comments they do not create the impression that this is somehow a war between equals. This is a big country against a small country. This is an aggressor against a country that has been attacked. There is a big difference between providing weapons to a country that is defending itself and providing support to a country that is on the attack. Just like the Deputies, I am appalled to see the arms industry making money and increasing profits as a result of what is happening in Ukraine. I would much rather see that money being spent on reconstruction.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> I travelled to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos on 18 January. That evening I attended an IDA Ireland event where I met with some leading job creators in Ireland from across industry, including manufacturing, chemicals, technology and finance. On 19 January, I attended a foreign policy-focused event hosted by Lally Weymouth of <i>The Washington Post</i> with guests including other leaders, heads of international organisations and members of the US Administration. That afternoon I participated in a panel discussion on widening Europe's horizons which considered how the new European political community can foster transformative political dialogue amid wider geopolitical shifts. My fellow panellists included the Serbian President, Aleksandar Vuči, the Albanian Prime Minister, Edi Rama and the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola who will visit Dublin on 2 February. I also attended a dinner hosted by the World Economic Forum president, Børge Brende, which included other participants from the European Commission, the IMF, the OECD, other European leaders and representatives from industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> During my visit, I had meetings with a range of international and political leaders, including the President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, who will host the next European Political Community summit in June, and Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Belarusian democratic movement. We talked about her particular connection to Roscrea and Ireland, the political situation in Belarus and the ongoing war in Ukraine. I also met with Samantha Power, USAID administrator, and we spoke about Ireland-US aid collaboration on food security and child nutrition. I also met with the leader of the Labour Party in the UK, Keir Starmer. We discussed the importance of a strong British-Irish relationship and the ongoing EU-UK negotiations on the protocol, as well as our shared concern for the restoration of the Good Friday Agreement institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> I met with senior representatives of multinational companies of significance to Ireland, including Intel, Meta and Amazon Web Services. These meetings are typically an opportunity for company executives to update me on progress with their operations in Ireland and their future development plans, including in the context of current job losses across the tech sector. For my part, it was an opportunity to emphasise again Ireland's core strengths, including talent, stability and a proven track record.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_439">The Davos gathering of billionaires, political elites and multinational corporations that are staggeringly wealthy to discuss the future of the world is sort of nauseating in and of itself but at least it provides the opportunity for groups like Oxfam to highlight gross inequality and wealth and put forward proposals. As I mentioned earlier, and as we have done ever since I have been in this Dáil, we are putting forward proposals for a modest wealth tax on those very highest of earners. Oxfam has proposed a modest incremental wealth tax on the net assets of people who have wealth in excess of €4.7 million. This is not a tax, as the Taoiseach said earlier, on ordinary people. Some 95,000 people have that much wealth in this country. Would it not be reasonable to put a 2% or 3% wealth tax on that wealth to fund housing, health services and cost-of-living measures?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_440">The only good thing about Davos is the fact that Oxfam produces this report on a yearly basis to highlight the galloping inequality in the world, which has accelerated throughout the process of Covid when some big corporations made massive profits. The consequence of that galloping inequality is that in Ireland, the two richest people now have as much wealth - €15 billion - as the poorest 50% of the population. The number of super-rich people has doubled. Does the Taoiseach have a problem with that or does he just think that is the price of capitalism, that these people gather all the wealth but some of it trickles down? All the evidence suggests that the money is not trickling down. Instead, it continues to flood upwards but he is resistant to proper taxes on corporations or wealth taxes to try to use some of this revenue to benefit the majority in this society.</p>

            <p eId="para_441">I just have a different perspective on it to the Deputy. I do not think our end points are different; I just have a different perspective on it. It is the Deputy's view that higher taxes always result in more revenues for the Government, which we can then spend on health, housing and everything else. My view is that it is not necessarily like that. We have very low corporation profit taxes in Ireland and yet we bring in more <i>per capita </i>in corporation profit taxes than almost any other country in the world or in Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">It is the low taxes on corporations in Ireland that produce the massive tax revenues we can spend on health, housing and education. If we doubled or trebled our corporation profit tax, I think the receipts would go down. I do not want that to ever be tested. That is one of the reasons I am glad neither of the Deputies is Minister for Finance, because I think they would test it. They would hike up profit taxes on businesses and those businesses would relocate elsewhere, taking their jobs and profits elsewhere, and they would bring in a new era of austerity. That is not something I would like to see.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_444">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I am delighted to have an opportunity to introduce the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 to the House. I look forward to hearing contributions from Deputies today and in the coming days. As Deputies will be aware, this Bill is aimed at providing a robust statutory basis for the operating of recording devices by An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> An Garda Síochána plays a vitally important role in our society. Its members are on the front line every day keeping people safe and serving our communities. We know they do this at great personal risk to themselves. It is important that I take this opportunity, on the floor of Dáil Éireann, to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, all recent attacks on members of An Garda Síochána. I am sure I am joined by every Member of this House when I say that we must and will do everything in our power to prevent and discourage such attacks and call out and condemn them.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> We have seen a number of incidents in recent weeks where gardaí have been seriously injured. I am sure we all absolutely condemn these incidents. We have also seen something else, however. We have seen threatening behaviour from people who are intent on sowing division in our society. These people have not only intimidated and threatened citizens and people who are seeking our help. They have, in some instances, also sought to intimidate and threaten members of An Garda Síochána, a force that is protecting our communities. This simply cannot and will not be tolerated. Our gardaí will always have our full support and the full rigours of the law will always apply to those who seek to intimidate or breach the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Today, we are taking another step forward with this legislation in supporting and protecting the men and women on the front line in An Garda Síochána through the introduction of body-worn cameras. Gardaí will now be able to gather evidence of thuggish behaviour and secure convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> In the modern, fully digitalised society, criminals, especially organised crime gangs, have access to increasingly sophisticated digital tools to carry out their objectives. It is of crucial importance that An Garda Síochána has access to the latest technology if it is to counter such challenges. A modern police service simply must have effective and up-to-date digital tools to keep our communities safe and protect themselves from those who would do them harm. The principal objective of the Bill is to provide An Garda Síochána with those important tools.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> As Minister for Justice, I cannot and will not stand over a situation where we do not equip gardaí with what they need, not only to tackle criminals but also to keep pace with what are common policing practices worldwide. Policing services across the world have gained significant benefits from the introduction of these technologies. People will have seen their effective use in fighting and solving crime in other jurisdictions. One of the key features of this Bill is the introduction of body-worn cameras. The Garda Commissioner and Garda representative bodies have long called for the introduction of these cameras, and I have heard those calls clearly. This technology has the potential to deter attacks on Garda members and, where attacks do occur, it can provide strong evidence to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> I know from speaking to front-line gardaí that the first moments after they arrive at the scene of domestic abuse are key to gathering evidence, which can then be used to protect the victim and ensure the perpetrator is brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> As our road network improves, so too does the ability of criminal elements to move widely and swiftly and evade detection. The Bill enhances the circumstances in which automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, may be used by An Garda Síochána. By linking into a network of certain bodies such as the National Roads Authority, NRA, we will ensure that data are made available to Garda investigations in a timely manner. This could be of significant benefit to gardaí when, for example, they are trying to track down a vehicle they suspect may have been used in serious crime or may be carrying suspects or even a victim whose life might be in danger. ANPR allows An Garda Síochána to track the movement of vehicles, potentially preventing crime and saving people from serious harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">ANPR allows An Garda Síochána to track the movement of vehicles, potentially preventing crime and saving people from serious harm. Everyone in our communities is entitled to go about their business in confidence and without any form of harassment. CCTV schemes can assist An Garda Síochána to ensure this entitlement is fully enjoyed. CCTV schemes have long played a key role in preventing crime and protecting communities and businesses. </p>
          <p eId="para_454"> I want to emphasise my respect for the right to privacy of all our citizens. However, no doubt I am joined by my colleagues across the House when I say that I firmly believe that criminals do not have a right to privacy such that it can aid them to evade investigation, arrest or prosecution. Members of An Garda Síochána should not have their hands tied behind their backs when it comes to fighting crime or detecting crime and putting criminals behind bars. It is important there are safeguards. It is important that people’s privacy and personal data are protected. At the same time, we need to and must make sure there is no ability for people, criminals in particular, to hide behind that. </p>
          <p eId="para_455"> This Bill will deliver on two important commitments in the programme for Government, namely, to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Commission of the Future of Policing which called for the use of body-worn cameras to enhance the front-line capability of An Garda Síochána, and to extend the powers governing Garda use of CCTV and automated number plate recognition, ANPR, to help to prevent crime and to prosecute those involved in criminal activity<i>.</i></p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The Bill before us is divided into nine Parts and I will now outline briefly the key provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Part 1 sets out the key definitions of the Bill including "recording device" which is necessarily broad in order to future-proof this legislation, and includes devices capable of recording or processing records. Transitional arrangements for existing Garda or community CCTV are set out in section 7. A period of up to four years to transition to the new arrangements is provided for. I believe this will give ample time for the new processes to become established and ensure CCTV schemes are GDPR-compliant going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Part 2 of the Bill deals with the use of recording devices generally by An Garda Síochána in public places and in places where they are invited or permitted to be. This includes the use of recording devices on vehicles, aircraft and on Garda dogs. Since the definition of a recording device is broad, it would allow, among other devices, for recording from body-worn cameras, cameras, smartphones, tablets, dashcams and camcorders. Policing organisations around the world have found that body-worn cameras can help to improve front-line capability with the accurate recording of incidents. It can expedite analysis, bring about enhanced situational awareness and protect police from harm. Where body-worn cameras are in use there is a requirement that a visible indicator clearly displays that it has been switched on.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Part 3 will give An Garda Síochána the power to use ANPR for other policing and security functions. By designating certain bodies to transfer on an ongoing basis the ANPR records they create, it will provide An Garda Síochána with access to a range of ANPR cameras in strategic locations. The three bodies named are DAA plc, which is Dublin and Cork Airports, Dublin Port Company and the National Roads Authority, NRA, which has a network of ANPR cameras along the motorways in Ireland. Other bodies can be designated at a later date, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Use of ANPR for "focused monitoring" of a vehicle is provided for and will allow An Garda Síochána to monitor a vehicle for up to three months where it is related to an arrestable offence or to a matter relating to national security. The use will have to be justified and approved by a superintendent or higher, and any continued "focused monitoring" beyond three months will have to be authorised by a judge of the District Court. Retrospective searches of ANPR data will also be permitted for specific purposes and can be approved by a Garda of the rank of sergeant or higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Part 4 addresses an outstanding recommendation from the Fennelly Commission of Investigation. This voiced concern over the legal basis for recording of both emergency and non-emergency lines by the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Part 5 provides for a new authorisation process for CCTV schemes. Authorisations may only be granted to Garda personnel or to local authorities and these authorisations will have expiry dates. That is not to say that community groups can no longer be involved in the process. It is a priority for me that they should continue to have a role. This will include an important role for community safety partnerships which will develop community safety plans with strong local input. Any future amendments or additions to a CCTV scheme would have to be notified to the Garda Commissioner who would determine whether a new authorisation is required. Deputies will be aware of the concerns raised by the Data Protection Commission about the current arrangements. This Bill will put more controlled arrangements on a firm statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Part 6 will give a power to An Garda Síochána to process live feeds of third-party CCTV systems, such as those belonging to private shops, venues or stadiums, with judicial approval or where the access is required for less than 72 hours, with internal approval from a superintendent or higher. This Part, however, will not prevent An Garda Síochána from viewing third-party CCTV where the third party has freely allowed them to do so. The Data Protection Act allows a third party to share data with An Garda Síochána where it is for law enforcement purposes. </p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Part 7 provides for the Garda Commissioner to authorise the installation and operation of CCTV in Garda premises for the safeguarding of people or property, and for preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting criminal offences. This includes private areas of Garda premises such as custody suites and temporary structures, and places the use of CCTV in Garda stations on a firm statutory basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Part 8 sets out the codes of practice which will need to be drafted by the Garda Commissioner for Parts 2 to 6 of the Bill. The codes of practice will be important in setting the standards and procedures under which Garda personnel will operate recording devices. These codes will outline requirements in relation to storage, access, retention, deletion and data subject rights. It is perhaps important to emphasise that in the interests of transparency, the draft codes will be made publicly available by the Garda Commissioner so that representations can be made, and there will be numerous bodies, including the Data Protection Commission, that the Commissioner will need to consult during drafting. The codes must be approved by ministerial order and the final text of the code will appear in the order declared. Deputies should note that retention periods for recordings and data captured under this Bill will also be set out in the codes. Retention periods will follow international best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Part 9 relates to miscellaneous provisions. These include provisions relating to the admissibility of evidence, the review of Parts 3 and 6 by a designated judge of the High Court, and provide for an amendment to the Garda Síochána (Surveillance) Act 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> I will speak briefly about the amendments that I intend to bring on Committee Stage. As Members will be aware I intend to bring a report to the Government on the use of facial recognition technology, FRT, by An Garda Síochána. FRT has potentially transformational benefits in regard to certain specific areas of police work, in particular retrospectively examining CCTV which is already in the possession of An Garda Síochána. The accurate and efficient identification of suspects and equally, the elimination of individuals from inquiries, are key pillars to ensure that An Garda Síochána meets its statutory obligations. The ability to automate searches on legally held images and footage would allow the organisation to operate more efficiently and effectively. The current process of long manual searches which potentially involves a team of gardaí manually going through CCTV footage for months to find a short few clips which may be relevant to an investigation, is well outdated and extremely inefficient. This is particularly the case where time is of the essence. Members can imagine manually having to go through hours and hours, indeed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage where time is of the essence in a murder investigation, or where there is a missing person or child abuse, when we simply do not have the time to spare. It is in the interests of all parties, not least the victims of crime, to have criminal investigations pursued as effectively and rapidly as possible. The circumstances and environment in which FRT would be used are limited to specific-use cases which are, in my view, completely justifiable. The Garda Commissioner and staff have made a compelling case for the use of this technology in certain limited circumstances. When the Minister for Justice hears from the Garda Commissioner in regard to this, it is important to relay that to the House. It is important that a Minister for Justice would seek to act on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Retrospective facial recognition technology, RFRT, would aid the identification of suspects who are suspected of having carried out an arrestable offence. A striking example would be Garda work in combatting child sexual abuse online. As things stand, gardaí are forced to review what could be hundreds of thousands of the most harrowing images or footage of these crimes. Should FRT eventually be included in this Bill, gardaí will be able to utilise that tool in order to quickly identify both victims and perpetrators. I appreciate that there are different, genuinely and sincerely held views on this issue in the House, and indeed outside it. That is why, in the coming weeks, I will engage further with colleagues in the Government and others on FRT. The central theme of the Bill is that any proposed use of a particular technology must be necessary and proportionate. </p>
          <p eId="para_469">That approach would continue with any amendments that I bring forward in regard to the inclusion of facial recognition in the Bill being subject to considerable safeguards and oversight. This would include judicial oversight over the operation of this technology, a strict prior approval mechanism for its use and Garda personnel remaining responsible as decision-makers, meaning that there would certainly not be any "machine” decision-making process. Data protection impact and human rights impact assessments will be required and, just like other crucial aspects of this Bill, any inclusion of facial recognition technology would be subject to a code of practice so as to ensure transparency as to the procedures involved in the use of such technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> One final point that I feel is important to make is the place of victims in consideration of the inclusion of FRT. The Government has placed an emphasis on ensuring that the voice of victims is heard throughout the criminal justice system. I believe very strongly that any inclusion of such amendments would be an important aid to victims in furthering investigations as quickly as possible. I want to be very clear that, at the moment, the factual position of the Government is that FRT will receive consideration and there will be a report to Government before Committee Stage of this legislation. I am eager to engage with members of the Government and the Opposition to ensure we get it right and we arrive at the right point. I hope there will be an opportunity for Members of the Oireachtas in an appropriate way to perhaps hear the perspective and views of An Garda Síochána as to why they believe this can genuinely help them as they go about their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> The Bill is about providing transparency to us all as to the standards and procedures that gardaí must follow when using recording devices under this Bill. The tenth principle of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report is that policing must be innovative, adaptive and cost effective. In the current environment, we need An Garda Síochána to have the tools and resources to combat crime and to fulfil its primary duty of protecting the public. There are compelling reasons gardaí should be allowed access to technology and to body cams, and there are strict requirements under law to introduce clear and sufficient safeguards around this.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Today is an important day. It is a day when the Dáil and the Oireachtas come together to begin the passage of a law that will allow front-line members of An Garda Síochána - the men and women who put on the uniform and go out and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe - access to devices that will help to keep them safe and help them to bring perpetrators to justice. I want to end where I began, in condemning in the strongest possible terms recent attacks on members of An Garda Síochána, and in calling out the fact we are seeing people in certain circumstances, not just trying to intimidate members of communities, but also trying to intimidate the men and women of An Garda Síochána. We must never accept that and we will never accept it. We must ensure it is met with the full rigours of the law. We must ensure we legislate to provide that protection through body-worn cameras and further additional protection for gardaí. I commend the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">We welcome much of what is in the Bill and the advance that it represents. I understand there is a necessity to use modern technology in every way possible to advance the work of An Garda Síochána and to keep communities and people safe across all aspects of our society, and that includes everyone who is involved in public service. I want to echo the Minister's comments in regard to the recent attacks against members of An Garda Síochána and, indeed, attacks against other people in the public service - I think of bus drivers, train drivers and people in our accident and emergency services - and people in all walks of life who have been the victims of vile abuse and, at times, attack. We have to build a society which does not tolerate that kind of behaviour under any circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I am aware that some groups are not supportive of some of the measures in the Bill and we have to give that due recognition as well. People's privacy and the need to ensure we have balance in all aspects is something we need to be conscious of and work towards. I am aware that organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have voiced their strong opposition to many aspects of the Bill, and we have to take due consideration of that. In many countries around the world, there is the use of technology by police forces that are often not using the law appropriately, as we have seen recently in that great bastion of democracy, the United States, where we see people being attacked and all of that sort of thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> One of the lessons that brings to us is that the very technology we are talking about has exposed some of those kinds of incidents. The protection of the public is one of the reasons I feel that, in particular, body cameras and other technology of that nature is appropriate. Of course, it is also about the protection of the police enforcement officer, so they will not be abused in the same manner that they would be if they did not have that technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> We have the agreement of the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Commissioner, who have all said there is a need for body cameras to be part of the future of policing in this country. People have been talking about this for a long time and it has been going on at least since I came into the House in 2016. I remember it being talked of at that time and I remember representations from the Garda organisations seeking to have body cameras and other technology used. Indeed, every time there is an accident on the roads, we hear calls for dashcam footage from the general public to be made available to An Garda Síochána. My understanding is that the vast majority of Garda patrol cars do not have dashcams, which flies in the face of logic, given we are looking for the public to provide this yet the vehicles that gardaí use do not have that. This is one of the things that needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> This raises a question. The Minister's party has been in the justice Ministry for 11 years and we are coming very late to the table in terms of providing this kind of technology. It does not reflect well on the attempt to ensure we protect people and provide the technology to An Garda Síochána to do its job properly. It is taking a very long time to do this. This equipment can deter individuals from attacking members of An Garda Síochána and from using the kind of abuse that they have used. The Minister referred in his opening comments to some of the things we have seen on our streets recently, with protests where protesters are usually holding up cameras themselves while they attack people and use all kinds of violent language against them. We need to ensure that the technology is there to protect members of An Garda Síochána who are interacting with the public. It is also to protect gardaí from complaints that can often be made through the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and other organisations in that there is actual evidence that cannot be contradicted because it is on the camera.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> We have seen more gardaí resigning from the force in recent times. I am also aware that having more technology does not provide us with more gardaí, and it is more gardaí that we need, more than anything else, not just in our cities but across all parts of the country. I am curious to know why there was a delay in upscaling Garda technology up to now, given gardaí themselves have identified the need for this technology for quite a long time. In the Dublin metropolitan region alone, we have lost 575 gardaí since 2009, so the actual number has reduced in that region, which is where there is most growth in population and the most growth in crime, antisocial behaviour and all of that. We need more gardaí on the beat, on the street, meeting people, involved in their communities and part of their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Two Garda members were attacked in Dublin during a routine public order incident a number of weeks ago. These members were, in fact, brought in from another station to cover duties in that area because of the scarcity. All of this speaks to the problem that we have in terms of numbers. People are simply not joining An Garda Síochána and it is a question of what we need to do to address that. That is vital to any possibility of creating a force which is capable of dealing with the problems that we see across the length and breadth of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I am aware the Minister intends to introduce legislation on facial recognition technology, as he mentioned in his comments. I am sceptical and I have concerns about it, although, at the same time, when the Minister mentions incidents of sexual crime online and the tracing of people who are being trafficked, I understand there is some logic to this. However, again, we need to bring balance to this. There is a great fear that it can be used wrongly. Certainly, in other jurisdictions, it was used in incidents of racial profiling and other types of situations that are simply not the direction we need to go in. We need to bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The overall direction of travel in bringing more technology to the table is vital to ensure that we have the technology to protect not just the community but also those who enforce the law, namely, the members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> We must also know how the data are going to be stored. The Minister mentioned GDPR in his speech and the difficulties in regard to that. CCTV has been mired in controversy and difficulty for many years because of the role of local authorities in providing sites, monitoring and access. It has become a very difficult and fraught area. There is an opportunity in the legislation to streamline that and to get it right. We must ensure that we can do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> We must also ensure that data are stored appropriately. We must be able to reassure people that anything that is recorded by members of An Garda Síochána will not appear on Facebook, TikTok or any other social media platform, as has happened in the past in some instances we have seen. That has caused great concern for people. We must be able to ensure that we have the proper technology in place so that cannot happen. I seek assurances from the Minister that the recordings will not be going online or be stored in the cloud, which might provide access, and that the storage is independent of the Internet. That is the only way we can ensure that it cannot end up on social media. It is very important that we ensure that could be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The Minister referred to automatic numberplate recognition technology. That is something that has been around for many years but it is not appropriately used at all. It is something that should have been put in place a long time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I am also conscious that a large amount of the Department's budget goes every year to GoSafe vans that watch people speeding on the roads. I often wonder if the same amount of money was put into having gardaí doing the monitoring, that they would be monitoring more than just speeding. If an incident happens somewhere the Garda could observe who was moving on the road and other such matters. It does not make sense to have a private company being paid millions of euro just to watch one aspect of criminal behaviour when there is so much going on that requires the investment of State resources into the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> We must be conscious of the possibility of this type of technology being abused. We must ensure that rigid and strong safeguards are put in place so that it cannot and must not be abused in the future. That said, we welcome the direction we are moving in and the way gardaí and citizens will be more protected, but as I said at the outset, none of that is enough if we do not enhance the strength of the Garda Síochána. We must ensure that happens as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaDaly" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Pa Daly<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_488">I listened to what the Minister said about the Bill. It is understandable that there is some extra impetus behind it, given some of the recent assaults we have seen on rank and file gardaí. At the same time, doing so in a hurry creates a risk. The Minister's comments that everybody is entitled to go about their business without interference, and that everything should be proportionate, are interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Whenever I think of new legislation, I think of two cases from my previous work history. The first is when I was called to Store Street Garda station in the aftermath of the introduction of the drug trafficking offences legislation, which was supposed to target the large-scale criminals, the drug lords. The first person I was called to see was a young woman who was living in the Regina Coeli hostel in Dublin 7. Somebody had told the Garda that she had a small amount of drugs in her locker in the hostel. She had a young child in the hostel with her. When I arrived, she asked if it was true that she could be held there for seven days. There was also an implication that her custody of her child would be in danger as a result. Clearly, that is not what the legislation was intended for, but it was what happened on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I also think of a second person, especially in light of the automatic numberplate recognition that is coming in. It is being introduced to tackle criminals, but as the Minister says himself, everyone is entitled to go about their business without interference. An 18-year old young man from north Kerry came into my office who was attending one of the colleges in Tralee. He was stopped on Racecourse Road coming away from the college. He was pulled over by the Garda. I would say this young fellow had not even had a parking fine in his life, but he was stopped and asked a number of questions about drugs, if he had access to drugs, who he knew and if he could give information. I knew that he had no truck with criminality and when we dug deep into it, it turned out that one of the previous owners of his car had a history of drugs and the numberplate technology that came up in the Garda car identified the car as having been at one stage involved in drugs. He came into my office rather shaken over the whole experience, but while this type of legislation is again targeted at the big criminals, there is a danger that the young 18-year old man or the single mother in the Regina Coeli hostel are the ones that, broadly, could be targeted and upset and who could have their daily business interfered with by overreaching legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Notwithstanding the recent assaults - I understand the impetus - it is important to understand where and how these devices are used. We are somewhat hamstrung today, as the Minister in fairness mentioned, that some of the facial recognition technology has not been introduced and will be included on Committee Stage. It is difficult to have much of a debate about it because we do not know what is coming in. I note that the Garda Commissioner, as the Minister mentioned, recently gave an interview saying it was the intention to use facial recognition technology with the bodycams. One could ask if that is proportionate. We can tease that out later, on Committee Stage in particular. It would be important to put in place a pilot scheme in one or two areas before we rush into all of this to look at the effectiveness of this new technology before it is introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> On the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny, when we discussed the Bill last year, I raised concerns then about the wide discretion of the Bill for the use of such devices. The general scheme allowed for the use of the devices so long as it was "necessary and proportionate" for the securing of public safety and the carrying out of the Garda duties. The revised Bill improves on this somewhat, as it has more specific grounds for the use of the devices such as executing a court order or warrant, or recording damage to a property.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> I also expressed concerns on the definition of an "arrestable offence". In all of the other legislation, where somebody is to be arrested under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, an arrestable offence is defined as something which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years, but that covers nearly everything. If a person steals a Mars bar from a shop and the person is prosecuted by his or her choice or by the judge, on indictment, that falls under the Act. Is that necessary or proportionate? There should be some safeguards in that regard. Recording devices should not be used unless it is for one of the specific purposes. Perhaps an even more detailed set of circumstances could be set out before the legislation is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Another concern expressed in the justice committee at the time was related to the code of practice. It was unclear at the time when it was to be available and if the Dáil would have any role in scrutinising it. The phrase "code of practice" appears no less than 35 times in the legislation, which has about the same number of pages, and there is a presumption of lawfulness where any conduct confirms with a code of practice. The rank of garda who can approve a search of automated numberplate recognition data is also to be set out in a code of practice rather than within primary legislation. I can understand the need for flexibility on issues such as the type of recording device used, which I see is subscribed and has to be justified under a code of practice, but in other matters there does need to be more certainty. An easy solution would be to strengthen section 43 and give the Policing Authority more than just a consultative role in drafting these codes of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The provisions on data are fairly focused on removing legal obstacles for the smooth functioning of the system and address concerns about the storage of data and how these can be accessed by persons who encounter the Garda. Some independent and verifiable records of when devices are used and when a defendant can expect to access data, such as before trial or on foot of proceedings, are crucial. Footage can obviously be prejudicial to defendants, for good and ill. The equality of the legal arms of the State will be placed out of balance if the Garda has access to footage without any right for a defendant to view it. It is important to keep that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> I am pleased the Bill addresses the use of CCTV by local authorities. That is a good thing. For a long time, particularly since local authorities abdicated their former responsibility to collect waste, there has been an explosion of illegal dumping, especially in rural areas. Many people either cannot or will not subscribe to a private operator that demands that €30 is kept in their accounts and where there is a monthly fee of €14 or €15, whether people access the service or not. In a cost-of-living crisis, when money is tight, people will choose not to subscribe. They either go to the effort of bringing their rubbish to private operators or engage in illegal dumping. The amount of dumping can be seen along the sides of roads now that, by and large, is composed of plastic bottles. Something has to be done about removing plastic bottles. Domestic rubbish is also thrown by the side of the road. For a long time, local authorities decided they could not use CCTV to deal with this issue because of data protection issues but it would not be hard to do if they appointed data protection officers to be responsible for data storage. However, there was significant reluctance to do that. That is one part of the Bill that I welcome. It is to be hoped that it will tackle the scourge of illegal dumping, which is a particular problem in rural areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I look forward to further debate on the Bill. I ask the Government, especially those members of it who sit on the Joint Committee on Justice, to be very wary of the new, over-reaching legislation, especially in respect of number plate technology and facial recognition. Such legislation should be proportionate. Before anything is put in place, pilot schemes should be rolled out to see whether the legislation is necessary and proportionate before there is an erosion of civil liberties relating to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">I thank the Minister for his presentation. The Labour Party is broadly supportive of the idea of body cams for gardaí. However, we want to make a few points on this Stage. I was not a member of the justice committee, although I am now, when this Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny. I understand there was no reference to facial recognition technology at that time. I will return to the issue of facial recognition technology shortly but, as a matter of process, it is less than desirable that on this Stage a new element of this Bill is being brought in for us to deliberate on Committee Stage, when it represents a major change in the operation and organisation of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I will speak first to the positivity around the issue of body cams. It has been spoken about for a long time. The Government is moving on it and we are legislating for it, which is a positive. We have seen across the world, where body cams on police officers have been used, they have protected police officers, in addition to communities that previously were not believed regarding over-aggressive police forces and the interaction between police forces and their communities. The Black Lives Matter movement was emboldened because it had evidence from individual interactions between police officers and members of their communities and could prove the level of aggression that was there. Body cams will also protect members of An Garda Síochána. Even in recent days and weeks, we have seen the level of protests that are happening in some communities. Members of the public would not believe the type of vitriol and poison that is spouted and spat at members of An Garda Síochána until they see it, either live or recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> We rightly speak a lot about the abuse politicians and especially female politicians get. It is justifiable to speak out. Such abuse has to be rooted out and ended. There are so many public servants who get vile abuse. Female public service employees get disproportionately more vile abuse. That includes members of An Garda Síochána. We support body cams for two reasons: first, to protect the individual who comes into contact with An Garda Síochána to prove the nature of that interaction and whether the force used by a garda was appropriate and that interaction was respectful and, second, to protect the member of An Garda Síochána, again, by illustrating the type of interaction the civilian had with that officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> However, there is a trust deficit. We all know of the case of a vulnerable woman who was recorded walking down O'Connell Street in a distressed state and that the recording was shared among members of An Garda Síochána. We know that some sensitive material that members of An Garda Síochána are privy to is not treated with the delicacy it should be. Let us put it that way. We have to be clear that whatever recorded material comes from body cams that the Garda has will be treated with a lot of regulation and safeguards and that there will be penalties involved for anybody who transgresses that. If it happened in the case of the woman I mentioned, I am quite sure it has happened previously in other cases. We cannot have a scenario where very sensitive material of interactions between gardaí and individuals in the street is shared inappropriately, goes into the public domain, ends up on a social media site, and we reap a whirlwind of regret because we did not put in the safeguards on this Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> This is a major change in the dynamic of the interaction between a garda and a member of the public. It is a major change. We have to now, unfortunately, think of the worst-case scenario that could possibly happen from this dynamic and interactional change, prevent that happening, and work back from that worst-case scenario to where we are now. What would we say if, in years to come, some interaction between a garda and somebody in a state of undress or intoxication, or somebody who is well known or whatever, ended up online inappropriately? Would we then say we should have thought differently about the Bill when it was brought before the Oireachtas and whether we should have trusted the Garda enough to ensure the situation I outlined would not happen? Unfortunately, we have to work in the space where in the context of the individual right of the person interacting with the Garda, and that interaction being recorded, we are dealing with citizens who have to be assumed to be innocent of any transgression. If this interaction is now to be recorded, all of us have to be assured that the recording will be treated sensitively, and that it will not be tampered with, released, or end up in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Again, I support members of An Garda Síochána who are going about their daily work and are in confrontational situations every day. It is a difficult job. On that, it is fair to say we do not have enough gardaí. There are 650 fewer gardaí in the State now than there were three years ago. I am not suggesting this Bill is a distraction. This legislation is needed but within this conversation we have to also point to the fact that it is not a substitution for boots on the ground. The morale in An Garda Síochána has been spoken of, as have the reasons members are trying to get out, are seeking early retirement and are changing career because it is an unhappy place to work at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">When we have 650 fewer gardaí than we had three years ago, that has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> As for facial recognition technology, none of us want to oppose technology. It sounds great for a Minister to say, "Facial recognition technology is the way to go, the Garda Commissioner says the same thing, and who could be against that?" This is again a massive layer of change in the dynamic of how An Garda Síochána will interact with the public. Anywhere else it has been used it has proven to be problematic. There are districts in the UK where it has been shown that 80% of the cases that have used facial recognition technology have been defective. San Francisco has banned it. I understand EU legislation is being formulated to ban it in every European state. It does not make a heap of sense - this is my understanding of the EU position - for us to bring in legislation that enables An Garda Síochána to use facial recognition technology when it has proven so problematic in other jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the EU is formulating legislation to outlaw it and, therefore, we would be contradicting EU law before we start. That is notwithstanding the fact that the process in bringing it in is, we will all agree, less than perfect in that we are not having pre-legislative scrutiny, going by the Minister's contribution, and we are going to bring it into Committee Stage. Not only is facial recognition technology problematic, my colleagues in Sinn Féin have quite rightly said that it has been proven to be problematic in terms of the people it isolates and targets. There is a racial dimension to this as well, whereby it is disproportionately discriminatory against those of certain ethnic backgrounds. When the Garda Commissioner makes comments about every body cam having facial recognition technology, those are two major changes in one which we need to be careful about.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Let me put the position of the Labour Party clearly. We are in favour of body cams on gardaí. We feel they would protect the member of the public and the member of An Garda Síochána. There are major concerns as to how those data will be stored and not shared but protected and kept sacred, as it were, but we will work on that and we have to find regulations around that. On facial recognition technology, however, we are yet to be convinced that this is the right time to bring in this incredibly powerful tool on top of what the Minister is proposing when it has proven so problematic. The Minister will say that the technology can improve, that all these glitches can be overcome and that if we have the legislation, it can be amended in time. We feel that because the technology has proven to be so difficult to use effectively in other jurisdictions that have tried it, because police forces internationally are rowing back against it and because the EU, apparently, is bringing in legislation to ban it, we should not use this legislative process to bring it in. With the body cam there is enough of a change of dynamic between An Garda Síochána and the public for us to work on at this time. This seems to be a bridge too far at this point. We can toss it over and back on Committee Stage and we can bring in experts if the Chair of the committee is willing to do so to disabuse us of our difficulties with it, but there is a big difference between technology that can recognise somebody in a confrontational or criminal act and the recording of a public space where somebody is just innocently walking down the road. The usage of that technology to pursue that person is a different dynamic from the other of the two usages of facial recognition technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> I will reiterate that we support An Garda Síochána. We believe that body cams will assist them in their work. We want to know that the material they would gather would be treated sensitively. We want to be sure that the person being recorded will know that that interaction will not end up on some website somewhere. We also want to be sure that if there is an interaction that may reflect negatively on An Garda Síochána, there will be consequences for the garda who says the body cam just was not working, he or she forgot to plug it in or it went on the blink. There will be massive trust issues in such scenarios. Will there be an expectation that gardaí do not go on the beat unless the camera is working and that they check it before they go out? I can just imagine all those scenarios. On facial recognition technology, will the Minister please investigate what is being done at EU level and what has happened in other jurisdictions before he shoehorns in a major change in the dynamic that has been proven internationally not to work? The evidence we have is that this does not work and that police forces are rowing back against it all across the world. We could bring in legislation that will be useless because it will contravene what is happening in respect of EU law.</p>

        <speech by="#CathalCrowe" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_508">I welcome Councillor Shane Curley from Loughrea, a fine public representative from the west, who is in the Public Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> This is positive legislation. It is something I spoke about 18 months ago in the House. Not a week goes by that we do not see on social media gardaí being harangued, pushed, jeered at and, in some instances, punched and cars being driven at them by absolute thugs, scum. It is right that gardaí should be given every personal defence possible when uniformed, on the beat or driving their cars. A body cam is certainly the way to go about starting that and empowering them once again. Morale is low in the force at this time. I have seen body cams. Before I spoke on this matter in the Dáil some months back, I acquainted myself with what they look like. There is a light and a recording button. The individual standing in front of the garda at the moment of the interaction is not recorded unless there is a very good need for it or unless a situation has escalated. A light comes on. The individual is very much aware that the incident is being recorded. It is a no-brainer. It is about empowering our gardaí to once again become strong enforcers of the laws of our land, not to be pushed about by thugs on our street. We have seen far too much of that. I hope that during the Minister's tenure in the Department of Justice, as the helmsman of the Department, he will be the strongest defender of our front-line gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> As I said, morale in the Garda is low at this time. More than 100 gardaí are suspended. The Minister cannot interfere operationally in that. An investigation is under way with the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Some of the gardaí are suspended because they squared road traffic fines and others for worse alleged offences. The Minister cannot interfere with that. Some of those suspensions are now 18 months on. These are really good, qualified gardaí who are at home and being fully paid. They would be far better off back on our streets and on the beat. The Minister has to have some oversight of this to speak with the Commissioner. He cannot be judge or jury and find them guilty or innocent - that is for somebody else entirely - but surely this needs to move on. The Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation needs to move this on. The gardaí are either guilty or they are not. If they are not guilty, let them get back to what they are good at doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> Mobility in the force is quite limited as well. I have many friends in the Garda. When gardaí graduate from Templemore College, most of them inevitably end up in inner-city Dublin stations. There is a certain buzz about that because of the activity and the footfall on the streets of Dublin. As time moves on, however, gardaí get engaged, perhaps get married, start families and are drawn to come back to their home communities, but there is little mobility. There needs to be a perfect match. If a garda wants to come back to County Clare from Dublin, he or she needs somebody to go up to Dublin for him or her to come down to Clare. It does not always work perfectly. That in itself is a morale-draining issue of which the Minister should have some oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I wish to speak in my last minute about databases. We have had a DNA database in Ireland since 2015. It is now nine years old. We have the Eurodac database for fingerprints across Europe. Those data, I fear, are not properly stored or held. Eurodac erases its data every two years. Some countries have tried this in the past. It would be wonderful in this day and age if Ireland were to move to mandatory fingerprinting for all people. The majority of people have nothing to fear, and we have biometric passports now in a lot of EU countries, but when a crime is committed, there could be a data set there readily available to one's local Garda station and at the scene of a crime. At the moment it is hit and miss. It is a matter of dusting down the fingerprints and trying to collate those data.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Surely using all the scientific advances there have been in the world in recent decades we should move to some form of fingerprint database for all citizens so that gardaí are not left spending months trying to investigate something that could probably be solved quite quickly.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_514">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, in what is another component of the programme for Government and the adoption of the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing In Ireland, which called for the deployment of body cameras for members of An Garda Síochána. As many speakers have said, this is not just for the purposes of rooting out criminality but it is also for the protection of the public and members of An Garda Síochána itself. Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned in the initial part of his contribution that nearly every day in other jurisdictions body cameras are used for the purposes of identifying criminals or recording their activity, particularly in the US because we see the other side of it as well. I am not suggesting that there is some sort of widespread problem but if there is a minor problem we will be able to identify it if the body camera is on. Whether that is a matter of discipline for otherwise, it would be a matter for the member's superiors in An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> It is important that we have the opportunity, not just to explore the introduction of this legislation but that we explore other facets that the Minister has mentioned. The most important part of this Bill, outside of the body cameras or technology for An Garda Síochána, is the regularisation of CCTV, which every Member of this House and the Seanad, and every member of the local authorities up and down the country will know is plagued with problems. I can give examples of this and I am sure the Minister has one or two examples in his constituency as well, as I have visited it during large-scale events like the Bray Air Display. For instance, when there was a concert in my hometown of Malahide, CCTV was to go in to ensure orderly conduct, among other things. Some money was expended and cameras were acquired but they were never installed, even though a commitment was given, because of the concern we all know about between the local authority and An Garda Síochána. This Bill regularises that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Like Deputy Ó Ríordáin, I am a recent appointee to the Joint Committee on Justice. I was on it for seven years prior a number of years ago but I did not have the opportunity to look into this Bill when it came before us. I recognise its importance and the robustness of the terms of use are clearly important. I would go so far as to agree with Deputy Ó Ríordáin on his remark regarding facial recognition technology. If there is an opportunity for us to hear from outside bodies and officials within the Department, or both, in between Stages, then that could be facilitated by a Chair, on agreement with the committee membership. If there are genuine concerns, there will be an opportunity for that. I welcome the Bill, I thank the Minister for bringing it before the House and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me a few extra seconds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatriciaRyan" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Deputy Patricia Ryan<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_517">This Bill provides a legal basis for the use of body-worn cameras by members of An Garda Síochána, and for the extension of the circumstances in which CCTV and automatic number plate recognition devices may be used by the Garda. These changes were suggested as part of the report by the Commission on the Future of Policing. We in Sinn Féin are in favour of the use of body camera technologies as long as there is sufficient training for gardaí and measures are put in place to ensure the protection of all data collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The majority of policing services in Europe have been using body and dashboard cameras for many years. We believe gardaí should have the use of this technology in an appropriate manner. Fine Gael has held the justice Ministry for over a decade and has dragged its feet with introducing this legislation. Body camera footage is believed to act as a deterrent for those wishing to assault or intimidate gardaí. It can also assist in gathering evidence. It is vital that we get this legislation right and strike the balance between privacy and protection. I understand that some people will have privacy concerns, and these must be allayed. The Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are in favour of using this technology. We must take on board any advice offered by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> It would be remiss of me, as we are discussing the Garda, not to mention the elephant in the room and that is the issue of Garda resources. Yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m. there was an attempted abduction of a child outside a secondary school in Rathangan, County Kildare. The parents phoned the local Garda station and got no answer. They phoned Kildare town Garda station to be told that the garda was on her own in the station and she would arrange a car to call out to take a statement. Over four hours later, the gardaí arrived. This is not acceptable. I do not blame the individual gardaí, who handled the issue well; I blame successive Governments that have starved our Garda of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> The Minister should not take my word for it; he should come down to Kildare on Monday, March 6 at 3 p.m. to the meeting of the joint policing committee. Every answer to the issues I or other colleagues raise is that the Garda is doing its best but that the resources need to be provided. This Government's record is shameful; we have had enough of its hand-wringing and indifference. Our court system needs investment. Kildare has a population of 250,000 and we need a second District Court judge. We have the lowest garda numbers per capita in the State. We have had enough of excuses and we need something done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_521">As a Kildare Deputy I too would say that the ratio of gardaí to population has to match up. I have been complaining about that for many years. A policing service cannot be run without gardaí and counties Kildare and Meath are complete outliers in the ratio of gardaí to population. It is not enough to tell us it is an operational issue; there has to be a fairness on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I am not alone in having concerns about parts of this Bill and how the Minister for Justice has chosen to progress the Bill through the House. We are being presented with an incomplete Bill and the items not included in the Bill are the most important ones, namely the details about: how we use the powers included in the Bill; how they will operate; CCTV systems; body cameras; and automatic number plate recognition. We have no detail about how, when and why they will be used. We also have no detail about the level of oversight or data protection there will be, and those matters are all critically important.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The Minister without Portfolio, Deputy McEntee, has given us warning since last June that she intended to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage on facial recognition technology. Here we are eight months later and the plan is still to introduce a new and controversial power to the Garda on Committee Stage of the Bill. Does the Department not have the details of that ready yet? Eight months is quite a long time and here we are on Second Stage with critical information absent. As the Minister knows, Second Stage is the Stage when we talk about the principle of the legislation. It is difficult to talk about the principle of the legislation when there are big holes in it but that is what is happening. Facial recognition technology is not a tried and trusted method; it is highly disputed in its accuracy and in the ethics of its use. A significant bloc of the European Parliament, as has been said, wants to see it banned outright, and the European legislation governing its use will likely be finalised this year. From the latest reports I have read, Germany is looking to support an EU-wide ban on its use of real-time facial recognition, which is a measure the Department has indicated will be included in its amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I do not know what will be in the amendments, I am not on the Joint Committee on Justice and the Social Democrats does not have anybody on the committee but I am concerned that we do not have that information at this stage. We have no idea when this technology is proposed to be used and what the safeguards around it are. We do not have any information on that so why are we here with this legislation? We are being asked to legislate for something we know we might have to overturn and amend in a matter of months. Why, given the debate going on in Europe on facial recognition, are we expected to rubber-stamp its use in Ireland without proper oversight and debate?</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Joint Committee on Justice, which obviously has a Government majority, has stated that facial recognition technology should not be legalised. The Data Protection Commission has major concerns and has not been formally consulted. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Amnesty, the Immigrant Council, Pavee Point, Digital Rights Ireland and Irish Network Against Racism - I could go on - have all expressed significant concerns about and, in some cases, outright opposition to the introduction of facial recognition technology. It is unacceptable to railroad through a power on Committee Stage without the Bill going through pre-legislative scrutiny, a Second Stage debate or any kind of consultation with the bodies that oversee civil liberties and digital rights. It is an insult to the people of this country and Members of this House to give such little consideration to civil liberties.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> I am all in favour of using technology if it is appropriate and proportionate and there are proper safeguards in place. We are dealing with legislation and we have to think not only about what can go right but also what can go wrong. People will come back to this is something goes wrong so it is essential we give this proposal the scrutiny it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The use of the kinds of technology proposed in this legislation, namely, facial recognition, CCTV, body cameras and automatic number plate recognition, all have the potential to infringe on individuals' rights to privacy and data protection. In the case of most of these technologies, it is essential that we understand the need for safeguards and proportionality. Both the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights allow for the encroachment on the right of privacy where it is necessary and proportionate to do so but there needs to be a test of proportionality. There are 14 references to tests of necessity and proportionality in this Bill and not once does it detail what criteria would need to be met for those tests. There needs to be an assessment of what safeguards should accompany a surveillance measure before, during and after its authorisation. We do not have that. Operational matters are largely under the control of the Garda Commissioner but those safeguards could be the difference between an infringement on people's privacy rights and a reasonable tool for gardaí to have for their own protection. It is a matter of getting the balance right and we do not have sufficient information to do so. I could not be more critical of that particular aspect of how we are progressing the legislation. If there are correct safeguards in place, we could end up with something very good. If those safeguards fall short or if they are only at operational level and have not been predefined, we could run into serious problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The protection of human rights and digital rights is not an operational matter for the Garda; it is a responsibility of the Oireachtas and the relevant watchdogs. These codes of practice must be given to the Joint Committee on Justice to oversee before they are adopted. One of the most obvious questions that would need to be answered in relation to body cameras is who will turn them on and off and what are the circumstances around that? These are fairly simply questions but we do not know the answers. There is experience of this elsewhere. I am not saying our police force is anything like the many police forces in the United States, and I do not want to draw many comparisons, but a key issue encountered was the ability of some police forces to simply turn off cameras when they wanted to. We cannot have that kind of scenario. We have to be specific about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> While the intent behind the body cameras under this legislation is largely due to concerns about the safety of the police, it is a two-way system. If gardaí want civilians to be surveilled in their interactions with the Garda, gardaí have to be surveilled in their interactions with civilians too. It is a two-way issue.</p>

Those policy objectives, I am pleased to note, enjoy strong support from all parts of the House and I commend and thank colleagues for that co-operation. I acknowledge the constructive approach of all Members who have engaged with the process of bringing this Bill through the legislative process, in particular, the Chair and members of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> This Bill is the latest step in enhancing the Central Bank's regulatory powers. The transformation of culture in financial services organisations has been a key focus of financial regulators internationally in recent years and this Bill will place the Central Bank of Ireland among the most forward looking of these regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> This legislation will make individuals in financial services firms more responsive and responsible through driving individual accountability in decision-making at all levels, in particular at senior levels, in financial institutions. The repeated and very serious failures that we have seen in the leadership of financial institutions in the past are a constant reminder of how necessary it is to ensure that we have a system of regulation that is proportional, risk based and, most important, effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Like everyone in this House, I want to see a financial services sector that prioritises customers and in which honest, ethical and professional behaviour is second nature to everyone working in the industry. This Bill will play a key role in ensuring that this is the kind of financial services industry we have in Ireland, one that meets the needs of customers, stakeholders and the wider economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022 will introduce the individual accountability framework which comprises the senior executive accountability regime, conduct standards for firms and individuals performing controlled functions, and the duty of responsibility. By ensuring that there is clarity as to who is responsible for what and that every key part of a firm's business has someone responsible for it, the senior executive accountability regime will ensure that, in the event that there is wrongdoing in a firm which the Central Bank needs to investigate, the investigation can be more focused and effective. By providing for conduct standards setting out standards of behaviour for regulated financial services providers and individuals performing functions in relation to them and by providing for the sanctioning of individuals who breach their responsibilities, the Bill proclaims clearly the standards of behaviour expected of those working in the financial services industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Many of those working in the industry are in positions of significant trust and responsibility, positions where wrongdoing can have serious consequences for customers and others, and it is right and proper that people in such roles should be expected to act with honesty and integrity, due skill, care and diligence, co-operate with the regulator, treat customers fairly and comply with standards of market conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The Bill will also introduce enhancements to the Central Bank's existing supervisory and enforcement frameworks. There will be changes to the administrative sanctions procedure under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 and the fitness and probity regime under Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The fitness and probity regime will also be extended to cover various categories of financial holding companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> To facilitate the holding of individual's accountable for the actions the Bill will also break the existing participation link so that individuals can be held accountable for their own actions, whether or not this involved a firm's wrongdoing in which they participated. The Bill has also provided a timely opportunity to ensure the Central Bank's enforcement processes meet the standards of fairness and transparency required by the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the decision in the case of Zalewski <i>v</i>. Adjudication Officer and others. In addition to ensuring these processes conform to the required standards of fairness in the administration of justice, the Bill also provides for enhanced oversight by the High Court and includes other appropriate safeguards to ensure that the constitutional rights of all concerned are adequately protected and that the Bill will be able to withstand any legal challenge. Much of the detail of the individual accountability framework, including the initial scope of the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, will be included in regulations to be made by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> After the Bill is enacted, the Central Bank intends to conduct a comprehensive consultation exercise. This will present an important opportunity for all industry participants to engage with the bank on the detail of how the new regime will operate. I strongly encourage everyone concerned to engage constructively with this consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Once again, I thank Deputies for their support for the important objectives of this legislation and commend the Bill to the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_548"> On the four amendments, I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together as they are all very minor and technical in nature. These are technical amendments to ensure the proper operations of the provisions of the Bill, the requirement for which arose as a result of further examination of the Bill, as amended by the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_549">I acknowledge that the amendments the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, spoke of and his Department is bringing forward are technical and seek to address drafting issues in the latest version of the Bill. As the Bill reaches its Final Stage in the Dáil, it is appropriate to briefly comment on its provisions. We have waited a very long time, far too long, for the introduction of this legislation. Every customer has the right to be treated fairly and have his or her interests upheld. At a minimum, customers should have a guarantee that they will be protected from gross misconduct, unethical behaviour and corporate mismanagement. Where such injustice or misconduct occurs, the individuals who are accountable should be held to account. This has not happened. As we know all too well, customers in banking and financial services have not been afforded the protection of being confident that individuals will be held to account when they fall victim to mistreatment, mismanagement, overcharging or any of the other scandals we have experienced relating to financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> More than a decade has passed since the Irish banking sector plunged our economy into crisis. It is truly shocking that we are only now reaching the final stages of this legislation that will allow senior bank and financial services executives to be held to account for their failures. We have witnessed the tracker mortgage scandal which left more than 40,000 customers overcharged, with many losing their family homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> Public trust in the banking sector can only be restored when the culture at the heart of our banks changes. This can only happen by ensuring that individuals are held to account for failures when they occur. An individual accountability regime was introduced in Britain in 2016, seven years ago, in the form of the senior management and certification regime, and in Australia in 2016, six years ago, with the introduction of the banking executive accountability regime. In January 2017, six years ago, Sinn Féin successfully brought a motion before the Dáil calling for legislation that would ensure individuals in financial institutions could be held to account. The following year, in July 2018, the Central Bank published its report on the behaviour and culture of Irish retail banks on foot of the tracker mortgage scandal. Among its recommendations was for legislation to introduce a new individual accountability framework, including the new conduct standards for the senior executive accountability regime, and enhancements to the fitness and probity regime and the enforcement process. These recommendations were to ensure senior bankers would be held to account for their actions. We have been considering this legislation for four years since the Central Bank's report was published. This is an indictment of the lack of priority the Government have attached to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> That the legislation is finally before us is to be welcomed and today is a welcome day. The Bill grants regulation-making powers to the Central Bank to effectively implement the individual accountability framework in respect of senior executives in regulated financial service providers. It sets out four key pillars to the individual accountability framework. These are the new senior executive accountability regime; the new conduct standards for regulated financial service providers and their management and staff; enhancements to the Central Bank's fitness and probity regime; and stronger enforcement capabilities of the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The senior executive accountability regime, or SEAR as it is commonly known, will be introduced mainly by amendments to the Central Bank Act of 2013. This Bill provides regulation-making power to the Central Bank, with the bank to set out the details of allocated responsibilities and requirements regarding management responsibility maps and statements of responsibility. The Bill does not set out the sectors to be included in SEAR. These will be set out in the Central Bank regulations, although it is intended that the SEAR will initially apply to banks, insurers and certain investment firms. We will await the sectors to be included under the regulations but we in Sinn Féin hope they will be expansive. We are aware that in Australia, for example, plans are under way to extend the country's banking executive accountability regime to other financial services entities following recommendations from the Hayne royal commission. Similarly, it will be important to ensure the scope of these regulations is kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I raised a number of issues with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on Committee Stage. These include the training that will be needed by firms to ensure those responsibilities they have under this legislation can be implemented in line with the requirements. We also discussed the choice of six years as the length of time an individual can remain subject to a Central Bank investigation after leaving a role. I raised the point that many issues often do not come to light within such a timeframe and noted that this could pose a problem for ensuring accountability after the fact. I received a commitment from the former Minister for Finance that the Department would consider this issue. I ask the new Minister for Finance to do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I also raised issues with section 15 and the discontinuation of an investigation for reasons of lack of resources. It would not be acceptable to have this written into legislation in relation to a Garda investigation and I see little reason for it to be acceptable in this instance. Again, I ask that the Minister consider this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> While the Bill is very welcome, it is long overdue. Regulators and the public have waited far too long for this legislation that will finally enable the regulator to hold senior bankers to account. Those subject to untold and significant harms at the hands of our banking sector have had to suffer, while those responsible have gone unnamed and unpunished. That should never be allowed to happen. It should not have happened in the past and it definitely should not happen in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> We look forward to the regulations that will flow from this legislation. We also look forward to engaging with the Central Bank of Ireland on those regulations and ensuring this legislation enables the Central Bank to deliver what is so desperately needed, namely, accountability. It is crucial that we make sure this legislation is fit for purpose, not just today but in the months and years ahead. We need to be nimble on our feet and quick to respond if there are instances in this legislation where we can see that others are able to skite around.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_568">In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_569">
            <b>“Report on operation of Scheme</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_570"><b>2.</b> (1) The Minister shall cause a report on the operation of the Scheme to be commenced on the day that is six months after the establishment day and to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after its completion.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_571">(2) A report under this section shall consider the following matters:</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_572">(a) whether and to what extent persons engaged in the management, administration or operation of relevant institutions should be permitted or required to contribute to the cost of making payments under this Act;</p>

          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_578">(g) whether payment rates under the Scheme should be increased.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I acknowledge that it was Deputy Sherlock who originally proposed this amendment on Committee Stage. This redress scheme is a deeply insulting and disrespectful response to the unimaginable pain and suffering endured by thousands of people at the hands of the State and church. It is a shameful and intentionally inadequate response to the scale and magnitude of State-sanctioned abuse, violence and injustices perpetuated against girls and women, victims of rape and incest, disabled people and people of colour. While no amount of money can ever compensate the survivors, this is about recognition and the State fully and completely owning up to its past. Instead, the Government is clearly and loudly declaring that only the trauma of some survivors matters and only some violations will be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Mother and baby homes, institutions and county homes were involved in criminality and extreme human rights violations. They targeted abuse at some of the most vulnerable people in society. The Government's Bill intentionally excludes 40% of survivors, dismissing the pain and trauma of whole categories of people with arbitrary and cruel thresholds and zero understanding of trauma and transitional justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Unfortunately, this amendment is the only way we can legitimately raise the most egregious aspects of this so-called redress scheme. The substantial changes needed to remove the massive exclusions and denial of justice cannot be discussed. The Government is using its money message, as the expansion of the scheme would have a budgetary implication, to prevent even the consideration of these essential matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The scheme should include those who suffered forced family separation, people who were boarded out and people subjected to illegal medical trials. The survivors, with whom the Minister consulted strongly, advocated for the scheme to recognise all survivors. Numerous UN human rights officials also called for this and all Members have received hundreds of emails from ordinary Irish people on this matter. Despite all of that, the Minister is determinedly and wilfully telling up to 40% of survivors that their horrific experiences and the breach of their human rights are not sufficient or valid enough to be acknowledged in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Compounding this is the fact that we cannot talk directly about these issues today. I cannot propose an amendment for the scheme to include children who spent less than six months in a mother and baby home or county home. I cannot propose an amendment that recognises the horrendous crimes of forced family separation or illegal adoption. I cannot propose an amendment to ensure the scheme covers approximately 5,000 people who were boarded out as children. I cannot propose an amendment to acknowledge the children illegally experimented on by pharmaceutical companies facilitated by the State and religious orders. I cannot propose an amendment to provide redress for mixed-race survivors who endured particular abuse and discrimination. The only relevant amendment I can propose is to seek a report on the scheme, after six months, that would consider these fundamental flaws. I emphasise that again. After years of campaigning by survivors and advocates, after evidence from human rights experts and after thousands of ordinary people contacted us, the only thing I and other Opposition Deputies can do today is ask the Minister to consider a report. There are no words for how much this Government has failed survivors and now the rules of the House are failing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The number and categories of survivors being excluded from the scheme are deliberate. The Minister, the Government and senior officials in both the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform are all aware of these issues. They know what the OAK report's recommendations from survivors were, what UN bodies and officials have told us and what the Irish people want and they do not care. The denial of justice and disregard of survivors are startling. The Minister is directly responsible for crafting and leading this process, but every Government backbencher and Independent who quietly votes with the Government shares culpability for this injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> This amendment is the only instrument we have to discuss any of these issues. It is a gesture, a last call for some decency. Anyone who has engaged with survivors recently, or seen their posts on social media, will know they are tired. Survivors know the State will ultimately win. They have been worn down, so well done to the Minister and the Department as it seems that was the goal from the beginning. I am genuinely struggling to find the words to describe how wrong this is, to sum up how this redress scheme is more insulting than nothing and that it is just a new form of abuse, and I cannot even propose a meaningful amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> There is an opportunity to show some sort of decorum and understanding by letting this amendment pass. We know the Minister will ignore the report in any case but perhaps it will give his successor a basis to bring in a new and proper redress scheme. At this stage, all I can hope for is a new Government that will be willing to stand up for survivors and finally give them something more than empty promises.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenFunchion" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome members of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance in the Public Gallery who have been active not only on this aspect of the scheme but on everything connected with the mother and baby institutions over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> I speak in support of amendment No. 2 and my amendment No. 62, which is similar. I agree with Deputy Cairns that it was Deputy Sherlock who first gave us the idea that we could seek the publication of a report as it would mean our amendments would not be ruled out of order. There are very important aspects of this scheme that need to be discussed. If people were genuinely looking into their hearts, they could not support these aspects of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> I do not understand how a person born in an institution who spent less than six months there can be excluded. A person who spent seven months in an institution would be included, yet another person who spent five months, three weeks and three days in the same institution would be excluded. We cannot quantify the horrors, abuse and appalling treatment inflicted on women and children under the eyes of the State, and the religious institutions - let us not forget them. The State mainly oversaw these institutions. We cannot say that the suffering of a person who spent one month in an institution is less than that of a person who spent six months, a year or longer in one. It is very cynical and leaves out 40% of survivors. We all know it is a cost-saving measure by the Government. It can be dressed up in any other way but the reality is it is the reason the Government is doing the scheme this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The scheme also excludes those who were boarded out. The argument for doing that is that it is difficult to identify people. With so many advocacy groups and people working with survivors of mother and baby institutions, it would be very easy to identify them. At a minimum, an attempt should be made to identify those who were boarded out and ensure they are included in this scheme. The costs would be astronomical for the State but if we are genuinely sorry, we need to stop talking about it and match our words with action. When I used to work for a trade union, we often came across people who would say it is not about the money. They wanted an apology and recognition of what was done to them. The best way of getting that is by a person showing action. A financial payment of redress is one of the best ways the State can do that. It can show its sincerity by getting rid of the six-month rule and not excluding those who were boarded out or certain institutions. The scheme includes only the institutions that were covered by the mother and baby home report, which we all know was flawed. There were huge issues with the report and an addendum was inserted in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">So the State to a certain extent is acknowledging the flaws and the issues with that report yet all of the institutions that are not covered by it are also left out. Unfortunately, we will not be able to support this Bill because we cannot justify pitting survivors against each other - those with more than six months who were born in the institutions and those with less. It is impossible for us to support it. </p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I also want to mention the OAK report because as I have said before in this Chamber, for the most part, people were happy with the consultation process and felt they were listened to. The report was commissioned by the Department and now the very good recommendations of the report are being ignored. This is double cruelty. It is adding insult to injury to ignore all those reports when people were finally listened to properly. It is the same patriarchal mindset that forced women into the institutions in the first place and stood over stealing people's children. We are seeing the same mindset throughout this. </p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Mixed-race children were placed as babies not only in mother and baby homes but also in nurseries of other institutions. This is not being looked at in terms of a breach of international human rights. We have the chance to create a really good scheme that does not exclude people. I have often said that it is difficult to know how to put price on any of this but the very first thing you do is ensure you are not excluding somebody. A scheme that excludes 40% of the relevant people is wrong and flawed to begin with. We need to change that, include boarded-out children and all of the institutions and look at the actual report commissioned by the Department and its recommendations. I know there are a lot of amendments so I will speak on some of the other points later. I feel really strongly about the six months. I do not think any person could honestly say he or she believes that is fair and right. It is clearly a cost-saving measure and really needs to be removed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">I do not mind repeating some of the things I said the last time I spoke about this. I support this amendment wholeheartedly on the basis that it gives us a meagre opportunity to address the issues on behalf of the 24,000 survivors who were cold-heartedly excluded from the scheme. I do not know if the Minister thinks that way or if he thinks he needs to give them a reason but he has never given an acceptable reason for excluding people who spent six months or less in the homes. Is there a suggestion that six months of your life does not matter? Is it believed that the separation and the trauma of what happened to you and your family do not matter for the rest of your life? It is unfathomable. It looks like the work of a cold-hearted accountant whose main job is to minimise the cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> It is funny that we are revisiting this theme, having visited it over and over again in the Oireachtas in the past two days in the shape of a denial of redress and compensation to people in nursing homes or people with disabilities. There is a theme running through this from Brigid McCole to CervicalCheck to nursing homes and now to the survivors. The State scrimps and saves when it comes to looking after ordinary people, which is disgraceful, yet the Minister will come in another day and boast of the billions we have in reserve because we are doing so well. We have great multinationals and we do so well on corporation tax but we deny ordinary people their rights. This is outrageous. There is a significant amount of anger about it. I am sure the Minister has been getting hundreds of emails, as have I and everyone else in this Chamber over the past couple of days regarding this issue. It is almost as if you can feel survivors are gasping for air. This is their last chance for somebody to listen and do something for them. Some of the emails are terribly sad but mostly it is the anger that comes through. The anger is speaking to the Minister, who claims that he is pursuing twin tenets of acting with kindness and doing no harm but in their words, this scheme's exclusions are heaping abuse upon abuse. Even this discussion and this Bill, which will be passed because the Government has a majority, is another act of abuse. It is another act of hurt, abuse and pain that ignores people's real lives. I am baffled that the Minister is not doing the right thing by survivors, that he will not widen redress, that he believes that what he is doing is okay and that somehow he thinks he is acting with kindness or having the interests of these people at heart. It is not. It is all about saving the State money.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> At the same time, the State does not pursue the religious orders. I mentioned this previously. The Bon Secours order, which was responsible for a significant amount of this pain, hurt and abuse, is the biggest provider of private healthcare in the country and has lots of coffers, land and profits and we are still looking at a meagre system of redress that excludes almost 40% of the people who suffered under this system.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> The Minister is signalling a complete failure of the State to recognise the lifelong consequences of forced family separation such as the loss of identity and the abuse this has meant for generations, and it is generations who suffer. It is not just the immediate survivors who suffer. That suffering and scarring is passed on almost like DNA to other generations because it hurts so much and leaves people in such isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> This is our chance to raise those concerns and I hope the House passes this very meagre amendment. Fair play to those who tabled this amendment to say we need that report, which will give us a chance to revisit this. We would love to scrap what the Government is doing and redesign a scheme that treats everybody fairly, equally and decently and not to have to stand over this Bill not for the rest of our lives but for the rest of their lives and all the future may contain.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> This attitude runs through the Government and the State. You can go down a line from Brigid McCole to CervicalCheck to nursing homes and now this. The Government should hang its head in shame. I would have expected better from the Minister. I am not trying to personalise this but I would have expected better from him. I would have expected him to throw all his toys out of the pram until every single survivor was included and nobody was left behind.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">I add my voice to those of the preceding speakers. It is vital that we ensure the redress process moves forward but the way this is being circumscribed is unacceptable, unconscionable and unreasonable. It is quite arbitrary in lots of ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> A man came to visit me in my constituency office on Monday. He wanted to tell me about his experience. I told him that typically when we instance cases, we do not necessarily mention names but he said it was important to him that his name was mentioned because he said he did not want to be just a number. His name is Paul Lynch. He and his twin brother were fostered out at 23 months. They were 13 months in Roscrea and nine in Bessborough. They were taken away from their parents. Such was the insidious way the system operates, he believes that there was no legal basis for them to be fostered out and that their parents were married. He believes this can be proved. Still this was the basis on which they were fostered out. He never met his mother and it causes him enormous pain and upset to this day. </p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I have met many survivors over the years. He was just the most recent one. They are anxious. The State has accepted that redress is justified and necessary in the context of the huge pain and suffering that happened, the grievous injustice and the State's responsibility for that. Obviously these were private organisations and church organisations but the State was complicit and aware. It co-operated, participated and gave these organisations free rein to establish, run and perpetuate this regime. </p>
          <p eId="para_603"> It was part of a whole system. Sometimes we can talk about these things as separate and distinguish between the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and the county homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_604">While there were differences and there are different issues, ultimately they were all part of the same system and culture and reflected the same attitude to institutionalising people, particularly women, who fell outside of the mores and morality that had been deemed acceptable. Other things often came into it too, including race, class and all kinds of other snobbery.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> It is clearly important that redress is delivered. Many people are concerned that we reach that point as early as possible and rightly so, because they have waited long enough and many survivors have been waiting for far too long. This proposal to exclude those who were boarded out or who spent less than six months in the institutions is incomprehensible to me. Some other institutions that were not specifically named in the report are excluded too. The six months seems incredibly arbitrary. It goes against so much of what we now understand about infant mental health, adverse childhood experiences and the impact that trauma can have right from the start. That separation would have been immensely traumatic for infants. It is being proposed to simply disregard that as if anything before six months is of no huge consequence or great significance. There is no other rationale for that cut-off point except that it is the attitude the Department has adopted; is é sin, nach raibh an phian nó an fhulaingt chomh dona roimh an sé mhí, gur chaith siad tréimhse ghearr ann agus dá bharr bhí siad ar a gcumas a saol a bheith acu ina dhiaidh sin agus nach raibh an tionchar céanna orthu. Is léir gur imríodh drochthionchar uafásach mór orthu agus go raibh tionchar á leanúint ar a gcuid saol tar éis é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> There is no doubt that it would have continued. It shaped the rest of their lives. Of course, in that context, they should be entitled to redress. I cannot understand any kind of rationale that would exclude them and likewise for the other institutions. It am not sure whether it is due to Standing Orders or the Department but it is a shame that we are so restricted in the amendments which can be tabled. There is still time, through these institutions, to revise this. The weight of public opinion is clear. The Whip shall apply but if one asked people privately, I think the weight of opinion in here would not favour this kind of restrictive approach. It is clear that the weight of opinion among survivors is appalled, and rightly so. I urge the Minister to please reconsider this through the forthcoming Stages. Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire smaoineamh air seo agus gur féidir cur chuige níos deise, níos féaráilte agus níos córa a chur ar bun chun ceart agus cóir a thabhairt do na daoine a bhí sna hinstitiúidí seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">In my seven minutes, I would like to deal with the amendment, because when I am in the Chair, I make people deal with amendments with relevant contributions. It is difficult not to refer to the overall context of this amendment. We put our names to that amendment. I thank Deputy Sherlock for having the foresight to see that this amendment might be left in while the others were ruled out. The first amendment I had was to deal with the Title. It sought simply to include anybody who had been resident in an institution, period. It was ruled out of order. I wanted that in the context of many reports, some of which can be seen here. In fairness to the visitors in the Gallery and to Catherine Corless in Tuam, without whom there would be nothing, this goes back to 2012, with eight years from 2012 to 2020 and three more since. During that time, we had various reports. I do not want to keep repeating this. This is our last opportunity unless the Minister sees sense tonight. When this is adjourned, I ask him to take on board what has been said.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> We look at the human rights issues. We go from Catherine Corless in 2012. The commission was set up in 2015. There were eight interim reports in the end. The Minister kept the final report on a shelf from October until the following January, when he organised a webcam and told everybody the survivors were going to get a copy, but they did not. We have outlined this before. It is important to say it again because, all the time, we hear this lovely word that I cannot stand, "learnings". We are supposed to learn from experience and change. We have done nothing like that. We were supposed to learn from the original institutions redress scheme that made it a criminal offence for me, when I was a barrister, or my client to disclose what we got. This Dáil passed legislation criminalising the disclosure of the amount of money people got from the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Fast forward to the Magdalen laundries scheme, called maladministration by the Ombudsman, and to Caranua, which I have said many times is an abuse of the Irish language. "Cara nua" means "new friend", when really it was the old enemy in disguise. I have said this over and over and I have to repeat it. We are here tonight to address an amendment based on what we learned. We spoke about consultation. We got the OAK Consulting report. It is a private company which did a good job. It listened to the survivors. I understand that more than 500 came forward and said what they wanted. What jumps out from that is that they asked for no more division, no more discrimination, and inclusiveness. They asked to be listened to and included. They asked for the wrong to be acknowledged and for the apology to mean something for the future so that those who spent time in institutions and their families will have better lives as a result of the apology and the redress that we make. Redress in financial terms can never be enough. It must be part of an overall thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, set out the principles that should be in the Title, which I could not even change one little bit. IHREC set out the guiding principles for relevant human rights and equality at a minimum. It listed what should be in the legislation so that we could learn and show survivors that we have learned. We have not done that either. The Minister has stood over a system where there has been so much exclusion from this, while his press releases have put an emphasis on what he has included. He has left out people who were boarded out and those from mixed-race relationships. They have made many submissions pointing out the trauma and range of suffering that was involved. There is also the issue of children under six months. I understand that when the Minister was asked about that, he said, "I suppose children who were in there less than six months wouldn't have been aware of their experiences and would have been too young to remember their experiences." We have the <i>tabula rasa</i> approach of children being a blank sheet when they are born and still a blank sheet six months later, with nothing having affected them in any institution, not even this break with their mothers, so we exclude them completely. That is what the interdepartmental group did and the Minister is standing over that.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I am standing here with two minutes left to address an amendment that my name is on, in the hope that we can shake the Minister a little. He was on "Morning Ireland" this morning. All through my time in the Dáil, I really avoided personalising any debate, but he went on "Morning Ireland" and I waited with bated breath for the interviewer to ask him a question about the scheme he has boasted about as being the most expansive, most inclusive and biggest scheme ever to make redress, but there was not a single question from our national broadcaster. Was that accidental? When the Minister was asked how his Department came to exclude babies under six months, did he give answers to any papers or anyone who asked him, or did he come back and say that the Government is doing it for their good, that it does not want to upset them and that it does not want to tell them why it has excluded babies under six months? Tell me if I am wrong. I will be the first to say sorry because we all make mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I am here talking to an amendment which highlights seven parts to be included in a review after six months. That is the most basic thing the Minister could agree to in order that we could learn. It would give some meaning to the word "learnings". It is a ridiculous word that has been made up and makes a mockery of language. We are looking for a review after six months to see what we have actually learned from people on the ground. We have been forced to do this because most of our other amendments are out of order. If I was in the Chair, I would have to preside in that role too and say that they are out of order. There is something seriously amiss with this system when we have to do it like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">This debate is scheduled to go to 8.30 p.m. If the Minister has any sense, he will put meaning into words and say he is willing to listen. There is a finite number of people in this group. They have bent over backwards to work with the Minister, work with us and tell us. I think we have learned more from our experience with survivors than the entity of the Government has ever learned or looks like it will ever learn. </p>

          <p eId="para_614">First, I commend all those who have fought and campaigned, and continue to campaign with the emails they are sending to us in this House and particularly to the Government. They are appealing to it, even at this late stage, to rethink what it is doing and not to deny the survivors of mother and baby homes the closure and justice they deserve. After all they have suffered and been through and all they have had to fight for, this day should be the day when they get that closure and justice. Instead, as the Minister well knows, they will not get that. Tens of thousands of people will feel excluded and insulted. The abuse, suffering and injustice they endured at the hands of the church and the State for decades and decades continues if the Minister denies them that closure and that justice. This is not just an insult to those who are excluded on the arbitrary grounds on which the Minister has excluded; it is an insult to every mother and child who suffered forced separation in the mother and baby homes. It shows a singular failure on the part of the Government to understand what the crime and the abuse was that it can come up with this arbitrary, unjustifiable scheme which includes some, excludes others and has a league table including a price tag which commodifies your suffering. Does the Minister not understand how insulting that is for all the people have suffered?</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> One of the particularly dark, terrible ironies of something else going on at the moment is that there are dark and sinister forces running around this city for the last few weeks who are claiming utterly falsely that vulnerable, desperate immigrants and asylum seekers are a threat to women and children in this State because they are foreigners. Those people need look no further than this House, the political institution that is supposed to represent the Irish people and the religious institutions. The Irish religious institutions and Irish political institutions orchestrated decades and decades of systematic abuse of mothers and children - not poor, desperate immigrants or asylum seekers - and the State is continuing to do this and to insult and abuse those who suffered. I searched the Minister's speech on Second Stage and his other speeches in vain for any justification by him of this arbitrary exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> I am an adoptee, as the Minister knows. I was born in a mother and baby home. I was in a couple of them, actually, because I was sent off to England to be ushered out of sight. The child of a fallen woman, an illegitimate child; that is how the mothers and the children were characterised. I was then brought back. I do not even know how long I was in a mother and baby home. It is irrelevant whether you were there for one week, one day, six months or two years because the central crime that church and State committed was the primal wound of separating a mother from their child which, from the moment it happens, has a lifelong affect on mother and child. It is the primal wound that begins on day one. I always say that my story turned out to be lucky. I was eventually reunited with my mother and I was adopted by a wonderful family. Regardless of whether your story of what happened is terrible - and for some it is absolutely terrible; they suffered all their lives because of the primal wound inflicted by church and State when they were boarded out, suffered abuse, as mothers were forced to work essentially as slaves, were shamed all their lives and had to endure the stigma of illegitimacy - the truth is that to a greater or lesser extent everyone had a crime committed against them from day one when they were torn out of the arms of their mother and the lives they would have lived were taken from them because of the twisted, perverted morality of church and state that deemed some people legitimate, some people illegitimate and some women "fallen women". It is shocking, perverted and twisted stuff. Now we have a league table of arbitrary exclusions and a failure to acknowledge the individual, specific suffering that some people may have endured because of being boarded out, because of discrimination because they were mixed race, or whatever it was. It is shocking and still we have no justification.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I appeal to the Minister, if he is serious, and to the officials or whoever came up with this plan, even at this last moment. We do not just want a report. That is just a way of trying to force a debate. I am putting it to the Minister at the last minute that he needs to rethink this so that people can finally get the closure and the justice. He should step back from this now and listen to the survivors, the people who are at the wrong end of the systematic abuse and crimes that church and State committed. For God's sake, do not negotiate with the religious organisations that were responsible. There is no negotiation required. Take their assets off them and make them pay the redress and all the compensation for the crimes that they have committed. We should not be talking to them. We should be telling them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_618">First, I welcome the members of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance who are in the Visitors' Gallery listening to the debate this evening. Let us take as an example what happened in Tuam between 1925 and 1961. It took the courage of Catherine Corless to come up with the findings on that. Listen to the outcry among the public at what happened there and in other places. The light of hope came from the fact that first, the State apologised and a redress scheme was going to be put in place for the survivors. I have spoken to a large number of survivors. It is not about the money. It is about the principle, which is that anyone who was in a mother and baby home - any child who was separated from their mother and any mother who was separated from their child from birth - is a survivor.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> There is no such thing as an apprenticeship for six months before you feel anything. Every child deserves that to be said for them. There is no reason to put a timeframe on it. Anybody who has been affected by this and who has been separated from their mother should, in all honesty, be included in the redress scheme. Some very good amendments have been put down which have been ruled out of order for one thing and one thing only, that is, because it is a cost to the State. That is the damning thing about what is going on here. </p>
          <p eId="para_620">I know the Minister wants to do the right thing but the people in the Gallery, and all survivors across this country, deserve what was intended to be their ray of hope after years of holding a secret themselves. People here have spoken passionately about it, far better than I ever could. There is an opportunity right now, this evening, for us as politicians to stand up, hold up our heads, put out our chests and say we are going to do the right thing for all these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I ask the Minister to consider that everybody who was in a mother and baby home and everybody who was separated be included in the redress scheme, and that anybody who was fostered out also be included. There is no logical reason people should be excluded or to create division. We should not categorise survivors. It is unbelievable when you think about it. We have to consider the survivors, what they have said and what they continue to say. This Bill is meant to do something for survivors but in effect it is actually a negative, given that 40% of survivors will be ruled out of the redress scheme for no reason other than a decision that was made to save money. I cannot see any other reason for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> People have waited a long time for justice. The Minister has done a lot of good work since he came into office and I respect him and the work he has done. We talk about the past and the dark days but today we can shine some light or some ray of hope on this horrid saga. We as politicians right across the House should be able to agree we will do the right thing. I cannot say it any other way. I cannot support the Bill as it is because we are excluding people from it. I ask the Minister to consider it, to go back to his officials and say we have to do this right or not do it at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> People are truly upset, which they should not be. They have had enough upset in their lives. People are concerned and they have been sending us messages over the past number of days. I have probably received up to 500 messages, each of which I replied to out of respect for these people because that is the least they deserve. We just need to call a halt and look at what we are doing and what we are trying to achieve. What we are trying to achieve is justice and justice is not served if 40% of the people are ruled out. I plead with the Minister to please reconsider the whole issue of the six months.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_624">There is no testimony more compelling than that of Deputy Boyd Barrett today because that is a first-hand account. If that does not impact on all of us, and particularly on the Government, then we are in cold times as regards the promulgation of this legislation. I put forward this amendment on Committee Stage because like others, we in the Opposition feel so constrained in seeking to amend legislation. The only tool we have in our toolkit so as to avoid a charge on the Exchequer is to put down these amendments and seek to have them repeated from Committee to Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> This amendment is proportionate. The Minister will say it is not but I would argue with him that it is because this scheme is vast in its undertaking and given the number of people who would be potentially omitted from it, we believe that at the very minimum this amendment deserves to be passed. All it calls for is a report into "whether and to what extent persons engaged in the management, administration or operation of relevant institutions should be permitted or required to contribute to the cost of making payments under this Act". I do not see how that is disproportionate. It seems reasonable to me. Second, the report would examine "whether the 180 days residence requirement provided for in section <i>13(1) </i>and <i>(4) </i>should be amended or repealed". There is nothing wrong with looking back at a section of legislation that has been passed to ask whether it is fit for purpose and whether it should be reviewed. Third, the report would look into "whether the Scheme should be extended so as to make provision for recognising persons who were boarded out as children as relevant persons". </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> When I put forward my amendment, which I am happy to share with colleagues, the Minister addressed the issue of the 180 days on Committee Stage. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_627">Absences of up to 180 days will not disqualify somebody from making a claim. The reason for that is that we know there were people who, because of what happened in the institutions, the ill health they suffered, the poor conditions or the poor treatment, spent large amounts of time not in the home but in hospital, often returning to the home ...</p>
          <p eId="para_628">We just want those people to be included. We want any report into or review of the scheme to ensure those people are included so they are not excluded forever or so the next generation of politicians is not revisiting this in 20 or 30 years' time. If the lessons of the last week or two are anything to go by, we will be revisiting this, mark my words, as sure as night follows day. The people who were aged from zero to six months will wish for this to be revisited somewhere down the line. I have no doubt about that. The evidence of the correspondence we have received should be enough to jolt any government into action in respect of that cohort of people who need for this to be dealt with, now and in a contemporary way - not down the line but now. That is the hallmark of fairness, for it to be dealt with in the here and now.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> In the amendment, we are looking specifically for a report into whether the duration of the scheme should be extended. That is not unreasonable. We were very conscious when we were putting forward the wording of this amendment that we would seek to be reasonable in our approach. We did not want to be rhetorical but ask the Minister in the hope he would see that nothing we are requesting here is unreasonable or disproportionate. That is why we find ourselves here today on Report Stage, because we failed on Committee Stage to have those measures put into the legislation and we are now asking again. We are coming back to the table to ask that those people be looked after.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Looking at the Minister's response in respect of section 42 of the Act, he again stated: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_631">The intention of section 42 is for two reviews to be conducted on the scheme. One is an interim review to be commenced two years after the establishment day while the other is to be commenced after the completion of the scheme. Section 42 sets out a list of matters that should be considered as part of these reviews and allows for the Minister to specify any additional matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Minister has the power to specify any additional matter. Furthermore, he stated, "Section 12 provides that the chief deciding officer shall prepare an annual report on the performance of his or her function and that each annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas."</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We are putting much store in what the chief deciding officer will determine. The Minister can "specify any additional matter." Those were the Minister's words when he spoke on Committee Stage. I am sure he will repeat those words at Report Stage. All we are asking is for the report on the operation of the scheme to include the subsections we have set out in amendment No. 2. That is not an unreasonable request. I say this in an absolutely non-partisan way and in the spirit and tone of being very conscious about the impact of this issue on society. There is a psychological scar on society because of this issue and the attempts by this generation of politicians who have this mandate now to try to improve the scheme in a way that ensures we will not be revisiting this at some future date.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">This legislation is long overdue but it is incredibly flawed, specifically, in how it proportions redress based on the time a person has spent in an institution. That is obvious to anybody who reads this legislation. Who is the Minister to determine that someone who has spent 179 days in an institution is any less deserving of compensation than someone who has spent 181 days in an institution? It is absurd.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> From speaking to survivors, it is clear to me that much of the abuse occurred when they were farmed out or boarded out from their homes. In many cases, people who were born in mother and baby homes were sent to local families where they were often ill-treated. They were required to work hard on the farm without pay and with no prospect of inheritance, in atrocious conditions, sleeping in sheds, sometimes with animals, and eating their dinner separately from the biological children in the family. This is not to mention the stories of physical, emotional and sexual abuse of the worst kinds that were experienced by so many, or the societal attitudes at the time that so many of these survivors had to deal with. They were deemed by many people to be second-class citizens, an attitude that was certainly the case in Tuam and that was reinforced, in many ways, in the State's education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Catherine Corless often talks about how the phrase "home babies" was used to separate other children in the national school, and how children who misbehaved in school were often treated with the statement, "If you do not stop, I will put you sitting with the home babies." This Bill makes no provision for persons who might have left an institution early but were placed by the State in settings where they were still abused, still suffered and were still othered.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I thank my parliamentary assistant, Mr. Luke Silke, who hails from Tuam and who has put a lot of work into drafting these amendments that seek to write the wrongs and injustices that are clear in this legislation. I sincerely hope the Government and Minister will listen to the debate and that he meant what he said when he told me he would listen to and take into consideration what we have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> An amendment pertaining to the Glenamaddy home has been omitted from the Bill. This institution is long closed but it is possible that some survivors are still alive. Even if there are not, it is important that we recognise the lives that were spent or lost there. I am thinking of Mary Crowe, who died from TB 100 years ago today in Glenamaddy at the age of one. She was one of more than 50 children who died between 1922 and 1925 in Glenamaddy for whom Mr. Silke has obtained a death certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> Some of the amendments we are seeking to bring forward relate to the time restrictions. Basically, we want to see a situation where applicants to the scheme are granted a decision within a period of three months and in a speedy fashion. Many of these people are of a certain age and need to have these decisions made fast. Within one year of the application, they should be given access to all their files and documents. That needs to happen. We cannot seek to withhold information from people. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure timely redress to people who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I have also tabled amendments that will seek to ensure that the scheme, when it is up and running, will seek to initiate and make contact with the survivors rather than just relying on survivors to initiate contact with the scheme. If the State is truly sorry for the way it has treated survivors, it would be actively reaching out to them and asking people for help in the process of redress rather than just sitting back and waiting for people to make contact.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I want to mention a very special lady today. Ms Sheila O'Byrne gave birth in an institution. She cycles regularly to the gates of the Dáil in rain, hail or snow with little handwritten placards and stands outside to hold this House to account and ensure there is justice for her and others like her. She is a fierce and formidable woman with a very big heart. I urge other Deputies to stop to chat to her if they get an opportunity because there is much they can learn from her.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> Throughout the history of the State, the survivors of the mother and baby homes were made to feel that their lives, due to the circumstances in which they were conceived, were of less value than the lives of others. This is wrong and this needs to be refuted wholeheartedly, as many times as we can. All human life is equal. They have as much right to this country as anybody else. They have as much right to life as anyone else. They have as much right to the Dáil and to justice as anyone else and anybody who has implied otherwise, at any stage of their lives, is absolutely wrong. The State must never stop apologising for how it has treated survivors. In reality, it needs to go beyond an apology. It needs to provide recompense for the wrongs that have been inflicted on these individuals. It must be done fairly and with a little bit of humanity. That is sorely missing from many aspects of this Bill. It is a shocking situation. It is deeply frustrating for the likes of myself. We tabled nine amendments, seven of which have been ruled out of order. Seven logical, reasonable, common-sense solutions to help have been ruled out of order, and I believe that is an injustice too.</p>

          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">I am both glad and sad to contribution on this Stage. Here we are on St. Brigid's Day, the patron saint of pregnant women and their children, at a time when new life is returning to the earth, and the lack of respect to the new lives of those who were born in mother and baby institutions is still being debated in this Dáil. Here we are again, with the Government's same old refusal to listen to the survivors, their advocates and families. We received thousands of emails on this and again, yesterday and today, I received multiple emails talking about the trauma because that is what it is. It is intergenerational trauma, which the stinginess, mealy-mouthedness and meanness of this Government is leaving for another generation to fix.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> We can be in no doubt that we all carry this whether it happened in our families or not. It is an act of extreme disrespect that children who spent less than six months in a home are not to be compensated. I have spoken to the Minister several times about this previously and about a particular case of a lady who spent just less than six months in a home. It is clear that this Government has its eye on the cost to the State and not the cost to the people on whom unspeakable wrongs were inflicted in how they were ignored in the exclusion. With what is going on now with this Government dodging its citizens, we can see that old habits die hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I am a representative for County Kildare, and while St. Brigid's light shone across Kildare from the Hill of Allen last night, there is no fear that it found a crack in this heartless Government because, obviously, no light shone into it. The Government's refusal to listen to and heed these people is so chronic that it is cultural. The Minister seems to have fallen into that quickly and easily. It is cultural selective deafness to people who were grievously wronged when they were babies and who are still being grievously wronged now.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I thank my Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy Funchion, in particular, and all the members of her committee for the work they have put into this. I also thank the people who have written to me over the past few days and every time that this issue comes up. I had to apologise to them when I was replying to a few of them this morning because I was not able to respond to them all individually, such was the volume. There were thousands of emails. The volume is growing because the mother and baby home survivors have lit a fire under people that will not be easy to put out. This issue touches people because so many families have experienced some kind of loss or know a family or friend who has. This is small island. We all know somebody who has been affected by this. </p>
          <p eId="para_649"> What the Minister is doing is cruel and despicable. His name is on it. It is even more cruel and inexplicable that he is content to pass it on to the next generation to carry and to resolve. This shows a lack of insight and a lack of courage. My heart goes out to all the survivors. I welcome the survivors who are present this evening. My heart also goes out to those who did not survive, all the dead babies, and to all who carry pain from past generations that might still be unidentified and unnamed but who suffered these events in their lives. They might be able to tell their stories but their stories resonate with everyone. We all know what happened. It is a story we will be going back to. We will certainly go back to it under a Sinn Féin Government to correct this absolutely disgraceful position taken by the Minister.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_650">First I will address the people who are here in the Public Gallery. I welcome them. I am glad they are here but I am sad that they have to be here. Like others over the years, I have heard the horror stories about what people have had to endure.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Children born into this world have only one chance at childhood. For the majority of people, all we want is that our children have happy-go-lucky, carefree and happy times and that when they grow up into adulthood, they can look back on their memories with fondness and smile and think of long summer days maybe out in a field of hay or going to the bog cutting turf and helping out, doing the ordinary, simple things such as going up a country lane to pick strawberries. We wish that they will have nice memories of doing nice things. </p>
          <p eId="para_652"> Some of us are fortunate enough that when we look back on our youth, that is what we think of. We now have to think that there are other people, who are adults today and who will think back on when they were little boys or little girls, who were being physically, mentally, sexually or any other way hurt or mistreated, or not being dealt with kindly. That is an awful thing. It is robbery of the worst type. It is the robbery of your youth, a thing that nobody can give you back. </p>
          <p eId="para_653"> I do not stand here today criticising the Minister or saying that he did anything wrong; I do not. What I am saying is that he inherited this problem and his issue on this is how he reacts to the problem. I feel that the Government has been brought kicking, dragging and scraping along with this. The advocates and abuse sufferers themselves, their families and the people who have helped them tried to seek redress. When I say “redress” I am not talking about anything to do with money or anything like that; what I am talking about is that these human beings would feel that the State recognises, “we were hurt, we were harmed”. Their childhoods were robbed from them. That is the big concern they have. Deputy Mattie McGrath and the others in the Rural Independent Group feel strongly about this because each one of us, in our political lives, has come across survivors of the abuse. It is so upsetting. I have heard other people speak far better than I speak this evening, and give their account of what they have come across. Other people are able to put the words together better than I can. We are so sorry for the people who are not here today, people who have gone on to their eternal reward. They will never get their youth back again. All everyone must try to do is try to make a young person’s life happy and joyful but we cannot do that for these people. What we have to do, politically, is do our best. We have to try to let them see that the politicians from all sides care, and we are all sorry and disappointed for what happened to them. </p>
          <p eId="para_654"> It is important to say, and survivors would have to agree with this, that there were people in the institutions of the State who were not like this. There were nice people in the clergy and in different institutions, who were kind. They did not want to hurt or mistreat anybody, and they never did. It is like everything; we have to be careful. Of course, there were horrible people who did vile things. There is the issue of people being out in the community and being hurt in the community. That was an awful thing to happen. People were entrusted to take care of a child and bring him or her into their home. There is no problem in the world with the work if a person was what I call “helping”. That was great but there is a great difference between helping and being treated like a slave. There is a great difference between being kept busy and being treated cruelly and between being part of the family and being shunned from the family; in other words, being with a family but not being with them. That is an awful thing to do to any child because a child is such an innocent, open page, with a pure mind and pure body, and a child will soak up everything. If they are treated kindly they will soak that up and enjoy their childhood. That is not what happened, in many cases. We also have to be mindful not to condemn all the institutions of the State, not to condemn all the clergy or all the priests and nuns because they were not all like that. To say that they were, would be wrong. There were kind people. I am so sorry that the survivors of this abuse did not meet those people. I am so sorry that what happened to them, happened to them. However, politically our job now is to try to do the right thing for the survivors, and let them see in what I call their “getting older years” that the politicians of today, from all sides of the House are there to stand up for them, to fight for them and to look them in the eyes meaningfully and say, “We are so sorry that the State let you down, we are so sorry that you were hurt while you were in care and we are so sorry that such a thing could happen in the Ireland that was there before”.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> We have to remember that to this day probably awful things are happening to children. We should always do everything that we humanly can to make sure that type of abuse, or any type of abuse, of our lovely little boys and girls, will never happen again, or be allowed to happen, on our watch, or on anybody else’s watch in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RodericOGorman" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_656">I will respond to the amendments first and then speak to some of the wider points. The Bill as it currently stands provides for a review of the operation of the scheme under section 42. The intention is that two reviews will be conducted on the scheme. The first is an interim one that will commence two years after the second anniversary of the establishment day, and the other will be commenced after the completion of the scheme. Section 12 also provides that the chief deciding officer shall prepare an annual report on the performance of his or her function and that each annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Section 42 sets out a list of matters that should be considered as part of these reviews and it allows for the Minister to specify any additional matter. I consider that these matters are appropriate to the purpose of this section, which is to allow for a comprehensive review of the scheme as enacted. It is for this reason that I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 2 or amendment No. 62 as both amendments propose matters which represent a review of the parameters of the scheme and a broadening of the eligibility beyond what has been agreed by the Government and what is being provided for within this Bill. This is not a function of the legislation and it would require distinct Government approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> However, I have given consideration to the matters raised on Committee Stage in regard to the manner in which this review was published and the timescales for commencement. As outlined on Committee Stage, I did not think it was proportionate or feasible to commence a review of the scheme six months after its establishment, as proposed in amendment No. 2. However, I was of the view that proposals brought forward on Committee Stage and today by way of amendments Nos. 59 and 60 from Deputies Ward and Funchion are reasonable. These amendments propose that reviews should be commenced not later than six months after the second anniversary of the scheme and the cessation date. Therefore, I am proposing amendment No. 58, which provides that the first or interim review of the operation of the scheme should be commenced as soon as possible but no later than six months after the second anniversary of the establishment date for the scheme, and that the review on completion of the scheme should be commenced as soon as possible but not later than six months after the cessation date for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> I am also proposing amendment No. 61, which explicitly states that where a review is completed, a report will be prepared and submitted to the Minister, and that the Minister shall cause this report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. It was always the intention that this would be the case. On Committee Stage, Deputy Sherlock pointed out that this was not explicit, and the amendment now makes the matter explicit.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> As I have acknowledged in previous proceedings in regard to this Bill, I am acutely aware that no one scheme can provide a response to the full range of individual experiences, pain and suffering suffered by survivors as a result of the legacy of these institutions. The State is proposing a scheme where applicants will not be required to demonstrate or bring forward evidence in regard to their experience, or enter into an adversarial individual assessment process. This learns from the experience of previous redress schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The general payment approach recognises time spent in the institutions but also the harsh conditions, the emotional abuse and all other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced in the institutions. The increase in payments, based on time spent, also recognises the impact of the longer stays in these harsh institutional settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I have said before that the payments scheme is one element of the range of responses by the State to survivors and former residents. This range of responses includes counselling services for all survivors and former residents, the very significant information and tracing Act that was launched in 2021, a service which provides guaranteed access to birth certificates as well as early life information, the establishment of a national centre for research and remembrance, the support for local memorial initiatives, the appointment of a special advocate, a children's fund to provide supports for children who are currently experiencing disadvantage, and the significant work to advance the excavation, exhumation and identification of the remains of infants in the Tuam burial site.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I know from my engagement with survivors that redress comes in many forms and means different things for different people. For many people who went through these institutions, a key desire was to have access to their information and, as we know, that is now provided within the birth information and tracing legislation. Over 6,500 people have sought information through that scheme and, already, just short of 1,500 people have received access to their information, some of them for the very first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> The Government has agreed a payments scheme which, as I said, has an estimated value of €800 million. It will cover an estimated 34,000 former residents and survivors, recognising the huge impact and the huge scale of impacts that these institutions had across the State over many decades. This is far beyond what was recommended in the commission's report. It is far beyond even what the interdepartmental group proposed to Government. This scheme stands alongside the other elements of the action plan, the information and tracing legislation, the legislation to allow for the exhumation at Tuam and the provision of a records and memorial centre. It stands as part of an overall response that the State is making in seeking to make amends to survivors of these institutions, although I have always said we will never be able to do enough.</p>

        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_665">It was incredible and somewhat excruciating to watch the Minister speak for almost seven minutes and not reference the main concerns that were raised in the Chamber, particularly the concerns raised by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Connolly. The Minister is right to highlight that this is one aspect of what has been going on in regard to mother and baby homes. For the past three years on the children committee, chaired by Deputy Funchion, we have been working on the birth information and tracing legislation and the burials Bill. The birth information and tracing legislation was announced with such fanfare in regard to people getting their information, yet it is a basic entitlement that everybody else in the country already had, so it does not deserve any kind of a medal or anything like that. People are actually waiting far longer than was promised for their information and they are still getting in touch with all of us to say they have not got their information yet, so there is no kudos for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> With regard to the burials Bill, we have a situation where the Minister has legislated to just intervene at Tuam. That is very welcome and there needs to be intervention there, but we know there are mass unmarked graves all over the country, and the Minister has legislated to not intervene there. Here we go again - the bare minimum, the exclusion of people and hierarchy. It is the same thing again. I am glad the Minister highlighted it because it is important to give context to that. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> I want to re-emphasise the need to, at the very least, give an explanation as to why the Minister has excluded people who spent less than six months in an institution. The Department carried out the OAK report. The findings of that report stated that the highest thing that survivors reported they wanted the redress to be based on was what Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about, namely, separation of mother and child and forced family separation. That was the main finding of the report. The Department ignored that and went much further down the list of things in the feedback, and went with time spent in institutions. Can the Minister outline to the Chamber and to the people in the Visitors Gallery how on earth the Department came to that conclusion? We still do not know. It was printed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> yesterday that a freedom of information request was submitted to the Department for it to explain how that conclusion was come to. What did they get back? That it was in the national interest for the Department not to say how it came to do that because it could upset a “vulnerable group” of people. It is basically saying “We are not going to tell you why you have been shafted because it might upset you.”</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> The general public do not accept this treatment of survivors any more. It has gone on for far too long. I do not think the Minister quite realises how much people are against this. I agree with Deputy Sherlock that we will not see the end of this and that cases will be taken in court if the Minister does not change tack.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">To be fair, one could have anticipated the Minister's response because it is consistent with the response on Committee Stage. I was hopeful there would be some movement by the Minister in respect of what we were seeking to do in amendment No. 2. I share the views of Deputy Cairns in respect of the culture that seemingly exists within the Department in respect of the freedom of information request that was put in by Elaine Loughlin and Conall Ó Fátharta, as reported in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, which reported: "Premature release of policy deliberations into the public domain carries significant risk to policy decision-making processes, particularly in areas that are highly contentious."</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Do not infantilise people who have a voice themselves. Do not referred to them as a "vulnerable group". These are people who are well able to stand up for themselves. Do not condescend to them. Do not patronise them. Meet them as equals. We know that the scheme is flawed because we know there are so many who are excluded because of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">We know that quite a number of people will not have access to healthcare. All we are seeking, in what we feel is a very reasonable way, is that the Minister shift a little bit towards the position the Opposition is promulgating.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Within the very limited means we have, we want to at least keep on the agenda the very people we are seeking to represent, namely, those who were boarded out, people who were born in mother and baby homes, and the people who are in birth to six months age category. I have a daughter at home who is six months old. Any of us who have children see the importance of the first six months in any child's life and the importance of the interaction between the parent and child. For the life of me, I do not see how, logically, we can exclude people in that category. The logic of the position being taken by the Minister is down to finance and how much money will be spent on the scheme. So many people are being excluded, which is not fair. On that basis, we will press the amendment and seek to vote on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">It is noteworthy that the Minister is sitting on his own and there is not a single other Minister or backbencher beside him. That in itself tells a story about the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> In his seven-minute contribution the Minister outlined that no scheme will cover everything. The point about this scheme is that we are meant to have learned from the past. I spoke about the situation in 2012. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae captured it when he said that we were dragged screaming to it. None of this was done proactively by any Government, not just the current one. It was the work of Catherine Corless, the people in the Gallery, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Clann Project on the ground and many others. They repeatedly educated us, backed us up and supported us, as they did in respect of the Government. They did not discriminate like the Minister's scheme does. The scheme is discriminatory, divisive and faulty. We will have learned nothing if we go ahead with it. At a most basic estimate, the Minister is excluding 40% of the people affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The Minister had no answer to the question asked by Deputy Cairns regarding the basis on which he made the decision. Is he still holding to the <i>tabula rasa</i> approach and saying that children do not matter? Is it the case that Deputy Sherlock, who has minded his child for the past six months, has utterly wasted his time because it did not make a difference? What the Minister is saying is that he could have simply left the child because it did not make a difference. I do not think he means that, but that is what he is saying. He did say it in the past, but I am sure he has changed his mind. This is a scheme that cannot go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Where are the religious orders? Part of our review and the points set out is that we look to see where are the other organisations. The Minister sent a letter or negotiated with them back in January 2021. What happened? What have the religious organisations said? What is the overall value of having an inclusive scheme and what needs to be contributed by the religious orders?</p>

          <p eId="para_677">I mentioned the Tuam group earlier, but we also have with us James Sugrue and Peter Mulryan, two of the boarded-out children. They want the point to be made that they were given a commitment by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, about their own cases and that they should not be forgotten. The difficulty we have had with the Government is that members say one thing when they meet survivors but when it comes down to brass tacks, we see a totally different approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> I am struggling for words because we have had so many debates on the mother and baby institutions and so many committee meetings, including through Covid, when we had to figure out how we could bring people up to Dublin so that we could hear directly from them. We overcame all the difficulties and, as a committee, we worked very well and very hard together on a cross-party basis. That does not happen very often. Yet, here we are and the scheme still excludes so many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> I agree with the other speakers that we need to know why people who were born in the institutions or spent less than six months in them are being left out. With all due respect, the reason the Minister does not want to answer that is that it is a cost-saving measure. I believe that if the Minister was in one of the seats over here, he would not fundamentally agree with this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I also want to briefly mention the religious institutions and the pharmaceutical companies because they must be pursued. I said on Second Stage that we should seek to pursue them through the courts because they must pay their fair share as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I know I am running out of time but I beg the Acting Chair to indulge me for 30 seconds. Before Christmas, when a health Bill was due to be guillotined, the debate was adjourned with a view to coming back to it after Christmas. That was the first time in the seven years I have been in this House that the right decision was made on such a matter. The same can be done with this Bill. We could adjourn the debate and, without going back to the drawing board, devise a scheme that will include everybody and ensure that all those who spent even a few minutes in an institution are included in it. Deputy Boyd Barrett summed up the entire situation in his contribution. I commend him on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">I thank Deputies Funchion, Sherlock, Cairns and others for their comments and contributions. For clarity, I want to respond briefly to something Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said. Of course, there were many decent people in the church and State, but there was a system that was official, orchestrated and systematic. It was approved and endorsed at the highest level of the State for most of its history and at the highest level of the church. Yes, there may have been individuals who were appalled, tried to do their best and so on, but this was the system of the State and the church. Every single mother and child who had their identity taken from them, every child who was torn out of his or her mother's arms and every mother who had a child torn out of her arms is a victim of abuse by church and State. There is an idea that we can exclude them. Of course, beyond that, some people suffered much worse, but it had nothing to do with an arbitrary date of six months. It often had something to do with being boarded out or being discriminated against on the grounds of colour or class, but it had nothing to do with arbitrary dates of a week, a month, six months or whatever. There is no basis for these exclusions, including the exclusion of institutions for the failure to acknowledge particular suffering, or for arbitrary dates. It is shocking that the Minister will still not respond to that central point. There is no justification for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I did psychology in university as one of my subjects. There are many schools of psychology, but there is not one serious school of psychology that believes there is a blank slate for the first six months and that things that happen to a person from day one do not impact on a lifelong basis. If a person is traumatised and something is done wrong to him or her, such as mothers and children being separated at that age, it leaves a lifelong imprint on the person. The person has been wronged. The State must acknowledge that but it is failing to do so. The Minister has not even shown the decency of explaining to the survivors how he came to this decision. Perhaps it is because there is no explanation. It is an accountant's decision and that is compounding the abuse, suffering and injustice of so many.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. As I said previously, I fully understand there are survivors, including those joining us today, who are not happy with the determinations made regarding the ambit of this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Government has made the point that during the engagement we had, when we spoke to survivors, which was referenced by Deputies, and when they gave their accounts of what they wanted to see in terms of the State's response, as I said previously, each person's account and recognition of what they wanted to see the State do was different. Many of them, especially those who spent shorter times in these institutions, placed their focus on the issue of information and the fact that they were denied their information for such a long period. In response to that, the State passed the Birth Information and Tracing Act. Deputy Cairns is correct. We are not seeking to clap ourselves on the back for the passage of that legislation. It should have been passed many years ago. However, it is in operation now and is providing people with their information.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> We believe that designing a scheme that does not require people to come forward or to give evidence of the abuse they suffered, but is designed on the basis of the length of time they spent in a particular institution - Deputy Boyd Barrett criticised the Bill for the list of times provided for in it - is the way to provide a scheme that will give people access to redress. It does not require them to provide information and does not require the cross-examination we have seen in previous redress schemes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">It is completely disingenuous to give that justification for excluding people who spent less than six months in institutions from the scheme. Some people highlighted time spent in institutions as a matter to look into in the context of redress. It is completely disingenuous. The Minister is completely and blatantly ignoring all the concerns that have been raised in the House, and all the concerns raised with Deputies by the general public, by acting as if he believes this is the right thing to do. We all know that there is no explanation for it and that it is completely indefensible. That is why the Minister consistently avoids answering the question, why there is nobody sitting with the Minister, and why nobody on the Government side ever attends debates on this matter. It is because this is completely inexcusable. The Minister commissioned a report. Its findings were that redress should be based on forced family separation. He ignored that, went down the list and chose this option. His reply is disingenuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> As it is the last word on this report, and all the other amendments we will speak to are technicalities and do not address the bigger and broader picture, I will say that I genuinely thought, when this six-month criterion was put in, that it was a red herring to distract all of us from the fact that the overall redress scheme offers such a low bar for payments. I thought this six-month requirement would definitely be scrapped-----</p>

People might get €3,000 or €5,000 for that. I said it before and I will say it again - you would get more if you fell over a pavement. The entire thing is an absolute disgrace.

          <p eId="para_838">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_839">In page 6, to delete lines 2 to 7 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_840">“ “applicant” means—</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_841">(a) subject to<i> paragraph (b)</i>, a person who makes an application in accordance with <i>section 19</i>, or</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_842">(b) in the case of an application to which<i> section 36</i> or <i>37(2) </i>applies, or proceeded with under<i> section 38</i>, the person on whose behalf or for the benefit of whose estate the application is made;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The amendments in this grouping relate to the definition of "applicant" and the treatment of applications which are made on behalf of relevant persons where the relevant person is incapacitated or deceased. The published Bill defined an applicant as "a person who makes an application in accordance with section 14, or a person on whose behalf or for the benefit of whose estate such an application is, in accordance with this Act, made, and a reference in this Act to an applicant shall, where the context so requires, include a reference to a person who makes an application in accordance with section 31 or 32 or who proceeds under section 33 with an application". Therefore, the term "applicant" could mean the relevant person, that is, the person who spent time in an institution, or a person acting on behalf of such a relevant person. Despite the definition providing that a reference to an applicant could be so construed, it was still creating some confusion in respect of parts of the Bill where the chief deciding officer required information in respect of both the relevant person and the person acting on behalf of the relevant person. There were also difficulties in respect of section 14(4)(b) and section 14(4)(c) where the chief deciding officer is required to establish an applicant is a relevant person and, if so, make calculations in accordance with section 19. The definition is, therefore, being stripped back in the interests of legal clarity and under the proposed new definition in the amendment, an applicant is solely the relevant person.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> On Committee Stage I flagged that amendments would be tabled on Report Stage to provide further clarity on the making of applications on behalf of a relevant person and this is provided for in amendment No. 51. With the assisted decision making (capacity) legislation now successfully enacted, these provisions can be updated to take full account of that legislation. That is what this amendment does. It also ensures we are fully catering for arrangements that might be in place in respect of persons who lack capacity both in Ireland and abroad. Subsection (a) of the provision provides for applications on behalf of a relevant person to be made by "a person who is authorised by or under an enactment or an order of a court to make such an application". Subsection (b) provides for an application "where the relevant person is ordinarily resident in a place outside the State" to be made by "a person who is authorised, under the law of the place, to act on behalf of the relevant person".</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Amendment No. 55 proposes the inclusion of a new section 34 to support sections 31 to 33, inclusive, and also as a consequence of the proposed amendment to the definition of "applicant" in section 2. This provides for instances where an application is made under section 31 on behalf of a relevant person who lacks capacity; section 32 where the relevant person is deceased; or section 33 where the relevant person dies while the application is being processed. In those situations, the chief deciding officer should satisfy him or herself that the person is authorised to make an application under these sections. The person making the application should furnish the CDO with any "contact details, personal data and information" required in order for the CDO to be satisfied that the person is duly authorised. When it has been established to the satisfaction of the CDO that the person making the application is duly authorised to do so, for the purposes of this application, that person will become the proxy applicant. The CDO may, therefore, deal with this person as though he or she were the applicant and the powers and duty under this Act shall be exercisable or carried out by this person. This proposed arrangement is important as the proxy applicant in this case will be engaging with the scheme on behalf of the relevant person and making all decisions in respect of that application, including the significant decision of whether or not to accept an offer from the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Amendment No. 5 provides for a definition for the term "enactment" as referred to in the revised section 31. Amendments Nos. 40, 41, 45 to 47, inclusive, 52 to 54, inclusive, 64 and 66 are all technical and consequential in nature. They all provide for amendments to other sections to take account of the changes to the definition of an "applicant" and the inclusion of the new section proposed by amendment No. 55. Previously in these sections, the word applicant was used to take account of the relevant person or a person acting on behalf of a relevant person. It is now necessary to specify applicant; a person who is making an application on behalf of a relevant person in accordance with section 31; or a personal representative who is making an application under sections 32 or 33.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> Amendment No. 54 provides for the deletion of subparagraph 3 in section 33. However, the provisions of that subparagraph are now being dealt with in the proposed new section arising from amendment No. 55.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_850">In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_6" eId="para_851">“ “dissolution day” means the day appointed under section 13;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> On Committee Stage I outlined my intention to bring forward amendments to provide for the office to be formally dissolved and for any residual functions of the chief deciding officer to be transferred to the Minister. New sections covered by amendments Nos. 15 to 19, inclusive, provide for the dissolution of the office of the chief deciding officer following the cessation of the scheme. These new sections partly reflect comparable dissolution provisions included in the Institutional Burials Act 2022. They are important to ensure clarity regarding the wind-up of the office, the smooth management of residual issues and the long-term management of records.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Amendment No. 15 provides the Minister with the authority to appoint a day on which the office of the chief deciding officer will cease to exist, with this day not being than the cessation date for the scheme, as already provided for in the Bill. The inclusion of this section necessitates a definition of "dissolution date" to be provided in section 2 and this is done through amendment No. 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Amendment No. 16 allows for functions that were previously assigned to the chief deciding officer to be performed by the Minister following the dissolution of the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Amendment No. 17 provides that any legal proceedings in train to which the chief deciding officer is a party may continue in the name of the Minister and the office may still be dissolved. Reference to the chief deciding officer shall henceforth be construed as references to the Minister. Where relevant, anything that has commenced but is not completed prior to dissolution day shall be completed on or after the dissolution day by the Minister. This is provided for in amendment No. 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> Importantly, amendment No. 19 provides that records in the possession of the chief deciding officer will be deposited with the Minister for the purposes of performing any residual functions. The records will be considered to be departmental records within the meaning of the National Archives Act 1986 and the general data protection directive and all relevant protocols will apply.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_857">I do not support this group of amendments and I have a number of questions about it. The Minister stated that he outlined his intention on Committee Stage. I am open to correction but I do not remember that there was talk of a dissolution day and the scheme being dissolved. It is not a scheme that will last forever. As flawed as the scheme is, I am not comfortable that we are talking about dissolution of an office and the transfer of powers to the Minister of the day, especially if there are any outstanding claims or legal proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> We often look for reviews in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">If I remember correctly, on Committee Stage, one thing we agreed on was that there would be a review. Would it not be more appropriate at that point to look at how the institution or agency would be dissolved and the handling of that? I am very uncomfortable with the fact that we are talking about dissolving the agency before it is even up and running. It gives too much power to the Minister and the Department, by default, regarding deadlines. I find it difficult to talk about the technicalities of the scheme because I am fundamentally against it due to everything we have just discussed on the previous amendment. I do not support this and it should not be included in the Bill. If there needs to be, for technical or legal reasons that someone may point out to me in respect of dissolution, can it not be done when we review the legislation? Are we not saying that we will review it at a two-year stage? I will not support these amendments for that reason.</p>

          <p eId="para_860">I raised the issue of the role of chief deciding officer on Committee Stage. There is still no clarity as to the status of that role. Will it be a Civil Service role? Will it be subject to the Public Appointments Service process? What grade will the appointed person be? Is there an equivalent grade within the Civil Service in respect of that role? What role will public representatives have? I draw similarities between when I make representations to the HSE or the Department of Social Protection. There are any number of officers with whom I deal with depending on the issue and there is a hierarchy there. First, we need to be able to make representations, on behalf of our constituents, to the deciding officer or a designated person. Second, what is the infrastructure around that person? What we do not want is a situation in which we are seeking to advocate on behalf of people in a reasonable fashion but we are disbarred from doing so.</p>

On the duration of the scheme, it states that, subject to subsection (2), the scheme shall cease to operate on the following date, in the Act referred to as the "cessation date", which will either be the date that is the fifth anniversary of the establishment day, or such date that the Minister may, by order, specify that is earlier than that date. There is provision for a cessation date for the scheme to close and, after such time as the scheme closes, there would be a dissolution of the office that was designed to provide the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> In response to Deputy Sherlock, there are several sections dealing with the establishment of the role of chief deciding officer. The method of appointment is set out in section 8. The chief deciding officer will be a member of the Civil Service. It is important to note that the role will be independent in terms of the functions, which are clearly set out in the legislation. Section 9(3) states, "The Chief Deciding Officer shall be independent in the performance of the functions conferred upon him or her by or under this Act." While the person will be a member of the Civil Service, there is a clear, legislative protection of the independence of the functions under this Act. An office will be established under the chief deciding officer that will undertake the various administrative roles necessary to implement a scheme of this scale. </p>

          <p eId="para_865">It does not make sense that we would set a date in the legislation as to when it will wrap up, yet we are supposed to do a review. If we do a review two years in, it will nearly be at the five-year stage by the time the review is done, the way things operate in this place. I find it difficult to support any of these amendments going forward given the nature of the debate on the previous amendment. When we had an opportunity to do the right thing, unfortunately, that amendment was not accepted. I will call a vote on this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_867">I understand Deputy Funchion’s concerns, but the legislation clearly sets out that after five years, the scheme will cease and that is it. The issue is if we are interested in having a meaningful review, the review could come up with a recommendation that the scheme should go on for longer. I am fundamentally opposed to the Bill in the manner it is laid out. I am now tweaking legislation that I am unhappy with. I am simply asking questions in relation to it. We are pre-empting the outcome of the independent review. In amendment No. 2, which we lost, we were setting out important criteria that would allow the scheme to be extended. I am fundamentally against the five-year limit. Another scheme - I think it was for the Magdalen laundries - was open for longer. Precedents have been set. We could also consider leaving the scheme open-ended. No justification has been given for the five-year duration. We are now pre-empting the review and the review cannot extend the duration of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> The role of chief deciding officer is supposed to be independent. I have a difficulty with that based on my experience of Caranua and comments made publicly by the former director and so on. The office will be within the Minister's Department. The chief deciding officer will make the decision within the Department. The appeal will be heard by a panel of individuals, one of whom can sit. When they make their judgement, that decision goes back to the chief deciding officer who conveys the decision, which is very unusual. When a decision of the Circuit Court is appealed to the High Court, the High Court gives the judgment. A person does not have to go back to the Circuit Court to get the judge to give the decision of the High Court. Whereas in this case, extraordinary power is given to the deciding officer who is then the conveyor of the outcome of the appeal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> Another section concerns me. I am usually good at identifying them but I am very tired now. There is a section that allows the chief deciding officer to request more information. The deciding officer can request a sworn affidavit from the person if he or she is unhappy with the information provided. The deciding officer can also seek information from relevant institutions or entities that have information. I could be wrong, but when I read that, I saw no provision-----</p>

          <p eId="para_883">Regarding Deputy Funchion's point, it was always understood even when I announced the pre-legislative process that the scheme would run for a limited period and would have a five-year duration. That is provided for within the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Regarding Deputy Sherlock's question on engagements by elected representatives, specific representations from Deputies or Senators will be dealt with in the context of the scheme. Members will be able to make representations to the office. Issues to do with privacy must be taken into account. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> Regarding Deputy Connolly's question, it is important to say legislative protection of the independence of the office is set out. There is a process for an appeal against a decision of the chief deciding officer that goes to the independent panel referred to by the Deputy. There is the final possibility of appeal to the High Court on a point of law. </p>
          <p eId="para_886"> In terms of information shared, section 17(4) addresses some of that. A full account of the decision will be provided in a letter in accordance with best practice and natural justice so there is a provision there. I understand section 17(4) addresses the provision of the information on which the chief deciding officer makes the determination.</p>

          <p eId="para_887">I have it marked it here and what I have underlined is "may". The chief deciding officer may share with the applicant a copy of information assessed. The word "may" is worrying. Who is going to guide the officer if he or she decides not to share the information? A decision was made not to share how the Minister came to the decision that every child under six months should be excluded because it would seem subject to further clarification from him that he did it for the good of people. He has not shared the basis of that decision. If we continue with that patronising patriarchal approach, whoever is the deciding officer can decide not to share the information because he or she thinks it is not really in the interest of the survivor or applicant and it is a case of "we know best". The word "may" is way too vague.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">I support the amendment. That the role be as independent as possible has been called for by the joint committee which is cross-party. It is set out in the committee's recommendations of which there are 27. It stated: "The independence of the Chief Deciding Officer will be critical to this and should be shored up as much as possible." Similar points were made in a slightly different way by various entities. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission made points about the need for proper training for the chief deciding officer as well as for the appeals officers and that they would have training in human rights and so on in relation to hearing appeals. Therefore I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">I am not in a position to accept the amendment. We had some discussion of this on Committee Stage. The Bill provides for the establishment of the office of the chief deciding officer of the mother and baby institution payment scheme within my Department. That office will be overseen by a chief deciding officer who will perform the functions set out under section 9 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> In reference to Deputy Connolly's point, section 9 provides that the chief deciding officer will be independent in the performance of these functions. That independence is set out clearly in the legislation. The chief deciding officer will be assigned staff to support the administration of the scheme. The responsibility for this function lies with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> Work in regard to the recruitment of the staff for the executive office is already under way as it is necessary in order to ensure that the necessary resources are in place and staff are fully trained prior to the launch of the scheme. As discussed, the scheme is intended to be non-adversarial in nature and will not require the applicants to bring forward evidence of abuse suffered. All staff involved in administering the scheme will be trained in trauma-informed approaches and the relevant communication processes. A training-needs analysis of members of this office has already been completed. It identified a range of necessary training modules that staff working in this office will need including issues to do with the equality delivery, in terms of call handling and also in terms of trauma-informed care, for which there will be an explicit module. There will also be an explicit module looking at the historical and cultural background to mother and baby and county home institutions. This range of training is being prepared for the staff who will work in the chief deciding officer's office. </p>

          <p eId="para_1055">My whole difficulty with this relates to "assigned staff". Where are those staff going to come from? It is somewhat similar to what Deputy Sherlock spoke about earlier. I mean no disrespect to them but there may be existing staff in another role in the Civil Service who will be moved over to this. If we want them to be fully independent the chief deciding officer should be able to advertise for staff and decide what type of staff is needed for that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">It should be solely with that office. It should not be assigned staff from the Department. That is the Department's way of being in and out at the same time. Deputy Connolly made several references to Caranua and every time she said it I could not believe I had forgotten to speak about it. People's experience with that institution was just horrific. The stories we could tell about people's interactions. There is a fear that this is going to be similar. This would be better for everybody. It would be better for both the Minister and the Department if this office was totally independent and they had no role whatsoever in assigning staff. It should be the chief deciding officer. That is going to end up being a very frustrating role if that person is asked to do something and then their hands are tied. We need that to be totally independent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1057">I have the same reservations as Deputy Funchion. The definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expect a different result. Do we ever learn from our mistakes? The Caranua experience was an unmitigated disaster. I do not think the Minister was involved in setting that up - he was not even here at the time - but it was a disaster. Surely we should learn but we are going back to it. In the last couple of days, the <i>Mail on Sunday </i>broke the story about the nursing homes, the charges and the fees. Several Attorneys General, several Cabinets and several different people were being briefed and it was all about who said what, when and where. It all boils down to one thing, an chéad rud mór, which is minding the system, protecting the system and keeping the system intact, whatever about the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> I too welcome the people in the Gallery, although some of them may be gone. Horrific things happened in the mother and baby homes and with the delays. I will not say this legislation is rushed because there has been enough talk about it but it is half-baked and not fit for purpose and should be taken away. Why would we not have staff who are independent? The same kind of thing happened with Tusla. Staff moved over from the HSE. Can we not go out and get independent staff and expertise that would be coming with a fresh mind and an open mind to deal with this objectively? No. The Department, like Big Brother, has to have its tentacles in everything and its engagement and overall management. I have seen it too many times. I saw it one time when I was on the Irish Council for Social Housing - I might be straying a bit - and a nomination came up for a place on the board of Pobal. There was an excellent lady and sister from Limerick and we said we would love to get inside Pobal to see what it is like. The meeting had to be adjourned in a panic in case any of us might get it and they came back after lunch and said it had to be a representative of the Minister. That makes an ass of any kind of independence or objectivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> I am very disappointed about what has happened in here as well. It is a matter of the State having done wrong but it has perpetrated the wrong now for ever more. It is trying to keep the lid on it but the lid is going to be blown straight off it in many areas across the State because people are thankfully fed up of it and tired of it. The system is going to crack. We have whistleblowers in many areas and I salute the vast majority of them. They are brave people. This is not fit for purpose. There is no objectivity and no independence from the Minister and the Department. We had the awful experience of Caranua and the unfortunate people who were dealt with there. They had been traumatised and went there for the trauma. Where is our humanity and compassion? Where is our self-worth and the value of people and their well-being? We talk all the time on different committees about mental health and well-being and valuing people's lives and yet here we are. The Government wants to keep them in this time capsule and keep them quiet about anything else, so they might go away. They will not go away. They are not going anywhere and we will not rest either until this is corrected.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2023-02-01T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1060">I just want to support Deputy Funchion's amendment. We have enough reason to worry given the Government has set its face against the appeals of survivors and people in this House to not exclude people. It has not provided an explanation for that because we all know the explanation, it would appear, is about penny-pinching on real justice and redress. That is in line with the sort of other issues we have been talking about in the Dáil over the last few days where the State has done everything it can to cover itself against what it sees as financial exposure, regardless of the consequence for vulnerable people or people who have been wronged by the State. We have seen it tragically played out again with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> It is telling that we say there is going to be a deciding officer who is independent but the definition of independence in this particular role is somebody who is willing to disagree with the Government if necessary, who has staff and so on and would, if necessary, disagree with the Minister and take the Minister on. We are dealing with a group of people who have been wronged by the State, who have very considerable concerns and are deeply unhappy with the redress that has been established because it excludes and because it is so minimal. The very least you would expect is that the deciding officer would have the capacity to be a bit independent. Critical to that, he or she should at least have the opportunity to recruit some of his or her own people, people the deciding officer feels are experts or particularly suited to doing the jobs necessary. That is not a negative commentary on staff that might come from the Minister's Department because I am sure many of those are well-suited and well-qualified but the deciding officer, if he or she is independent, should have the right to decide what sort of staff resources he or she needs, including what kind of people and what kind of qualifications they might have. This clearly sets out that it is really the Minister who is going to decide on the officers and the staffing of the independent deciding officer's office. The two things do not add up. It is not independence if the Minister is making all the appointments. It is a reasonable amendment Deputy Funchion is putting forward but I suspect that, as the Minister has ignored the appeals on the bigger and more substantive issue, he is probably going to ignore these appeals too.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I want to speak to the importance of this. I am looking at the advisory paper to the interdepartmental group from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission independence and oversight. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1063">The UN Special Rapporteur has set out minimum requirements that a domestic reparation programme should fulfil, including that the programme be:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1064">“monitored through processes that include consultation with and the participation of survivors” ...</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">IHREC recommends that the Government establish both an independent redress body to administer the scheme and an oversight mechanism to review decisions of that body. It recommends that survivors and individuals with expertise in human rights and equality, transitional justice and alternative dispute resolution should be represented on the redress body and any oversight mechanism. </p>
          <p eId="para_1066">What is being repeated all the time in this report is the importance of trained people. On one level it is positive that there will be training but I hear the word "module" being used. It is not possible to get training in a module. You have to have people with expertise, background and experience who understand the complexity of trauma. If we are moving from a position where we are talking about children between zero and six months being a <i>tabula rasa</i>, we have a long way to go and a module is not going to sort that out. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties also points out the importance of an independent process with regard to appeals. That is the theme throughout all these papers. There is a requirement for a human-rights based approach to set out the principles and then the process functions with that overall thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">That has not happened. I read out the basic principles from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which asks for the most basic elements to be enshrined in the Bill in order that we and the people administering it would know what we have learned and what we want to achieve. That also has not happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">What is being proposed here is not similar to Caranua. The legal structures are different. It is really important that we put this on the record at the outset. The independence of the decision-making on each of these applications as they come in, which is the central role for the chief deciding officer, is protected in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> The decisions of the chief deciding officer can be appealed to an independent appeals panel and those decisions can go to the High Court on a point of law. The protections that Deputy Connolly spoke about are built into the decision-making processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> On staff appointments, which are essential in the context of the amendment before us, Deputy Funchion described the ability for all staff to be appointed independently. That is almost an entire State agency. That is a State agency model. I have spoken about this previously. During the debate on the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, we spoke about the amount of time it will take to establish. Maybe the Deputy thinks that should be done. However, we have all spoken about the need to act quickly to make sure survivors and former residents can actually avail of their redress. We know the amount of time it takes to create a new agency in this State. Even with the work done by the Minister of Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, acting in her stead in terms of the domestic violence agency, they are looking at an 18-month period. I believe in a process whereby we have an independent office in a Department, which can use the strengths of the Department in terms of HR and the ability to get people into relevant places in good time. Importantly, however, it must have legislative protection and the independence of the decision-making function is the best way to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">The chief deciding officer should be able to appoint his or her staff independently. The idea is that the chances of having to appeal decision with a genuinely independent staff in place will be reduced. I am not talking about setting up a whole new State agency, which is different from what we proposed on the birth information legislation. If I was appointed in the morning as an independent person and I said I needed to appoint five, six, seven or eight staff, there is no way that would take 18 months. I cannot understand how that can be used as an argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> There might be many appeals, which I 100% support. Appeals are really important and they should be independent. I welcome that part of it. However, there will be less likelihood of appeals if we have a really decent, genuine, independent service that goes by what is right and by the regulations, and which is not necessarily kind of tainted in its view, for want of better words.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> I honestly cannot understand what the issue is with this. If the person is supposed to be independent, let him or her appoint his or her own staff. That is one of the key things about being independent. I cannot understand it. Part of me is annoyed at myself for being annoyed because this whole legislation is so flawed. I forget her exact words, but Deputy Connolly spoke about trying to change something that is already so flawed. These are minor things. I really think the Minister can concede some of these points. I honestly do not see how there is any difficulty with somebody who is forced to be dependent appointing his or her own staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_1270">In committee proceedings, I outlined my intention to bring a Report Stage amendment to section 13(6). The published Bill contains a provision in regard to double recovery and the residential institutions redress scheme, RIRS. The provision specifically relates to the inclusion of one institution, St. Patrick's, Navan Road, Pelletstown, in the scheme as this institution was also included in the scheme of eligible institutions for the residential institutions redress scheme. In practice, section 28 of the residential institutions redress scheme of 2002 prohibits a person who receives an award from the RIRS from disclosing any information in regard to that award. Therefore, in recognition of the potential difficulties for affected applicants, the administrative complications and the risk of causing unintended hurt and upset for those applicants who were unsure whether the provisions might apply to them, Government approval was obtained on 15 November 2022 to amend the Bill by removing section 13(6). This is being done through amendment No. 24. Amendment No. 25 is a consequential amendment to section 14 following on from the removal of section 13(6).</p>

The Minister is making specific provision to have St. Patrick's Institution included, which means somebody who may have gone to the residential redress board and got something but was prevented from disclosing it is now allowed to disclose it. Is that the case? The Minister might clarify those points.</p>

          <p eId="para_1276">I move amendment No. 26:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1277">In page 14, to delete lines 19 to 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">This amendment seeks to remove another exclusion based on spending a minimum amount of time in an institution. The section relates to people who make another application to the scheme in the unlikely situation that another institution is added to the list of institutions, and the arbitrary six-month criteria is relevant here as well. The arbitrary six-month exclusion has been widely criticised and highlighted as having no basis in evidence other than as a tool to exclude survivors. From a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year, we know that documents from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform warned that extending the scheme would “create a significant precedent regarding claims from many others in society who may feel they are also entitled to some form of redress or recognition payment based on any length of residency or attendance in an institution or other setting”. In a statement wholly ignorant of any research or personal experience of survivors, it is claimed that those who spent less times in homes would likely have gone on to live “comfortable and contented lives”. This position is, frankly, indefensible. I know we discussed it earlier but I do not think it can be said enough, and I would like to go into some more of the detail. The disregard for those who were born and spent time in a mother and baby home is highly immoral. It is disgusting that people are being denied any form of recognition because of what are, frankly, ignorant and hurtful statements from the Minister and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279"> It is important to give a sense of the overwhelming evidence and recommendations for all survivors to receive redress, especially this group. First, I want to quote directly from the OAK report, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1280">...the majority of those who participated in the consultation process supported a universal, inclusive scheme. The largest proportion of written submissions stated that all mothers and babies who resided in mother and baby homes should be eligible for redress, regardless of the duration or year of their stay and regardless of whether children were accompanied or unaccompanied by their mothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">Will the Minister address this in his response? The OAK report specifically states that survivors are seeking financial redress for those who spent less than six months in homes as children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">The Minister is going to claim that the overwhelming priority need expressed is for access to records, but that is not what the OAK report says.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283"> Second, when this restriction was first published last year, more than 30 clinical experts wrote to the Minister stating that childhood trauma has the greatest impact early in childhood. They pointed out that there is no threshold of time linked to this trauma and, as a result, having an arbitrary period of six months exposure is simply that, arbitrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284"> Third, a whole range of groups and bodies are calling for the removal of this exclusion, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Clann project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285"> The committee was very clear in its recommendation that the six-month residency requirement must be removed. Anyone who was resident in the institutions should be entitled to a payment, regardless of the time spent therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286"> In contrast to all of this, we only have the Minister's assertion that children would have been "too young to remember their experiences". In his response, could the Minister clarify if this is still his position? As Minister for children, what is his perspective on the importance of the first six months of a child's development and the role of parents in that period? There is no doubt that survivors were deeply impacted by their time in mother and baby homes and that they should be included in the redress scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287"> Amendment No. 63 relates to the addition of other institutions to Schedule 1. It could have a significant impact on many survivors. It is important that the Bill enables institutions to be added as easily as possible to facilitate survivors' accessing redress. This comes under the principle of timely access to compensation and the removal of time-based barriers, as outlined by the UN Human Rights Committee and survivors. Under the Bill currently, the Minister would need the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to add any institutions. Besides the implicit chilling effect that would have on any proposals, it is also a complex process prone to interdepartmental delays and discussion. Instead, amendment No. 26 proposes that the chief deciding officer and Minister are best placed to add institutions to Schedule 1. This is a simple and more efficient process that keeps the decision as close to those impacted as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1288">This again gives us the opportunity to speak about the six-month timeframe. One of the things that we did in the pre-legislative process in the committee was to bring in specialists in childhood trauma. It is probably one of the best sessions that we have ever had because it was so insightful and very interesting in terms of how it works. None of us can know or say what damage is done if one spends two years, two weeks or two days in an institution. One cannot say that someone who spent more time there is more deserving of redress. We are looking for the Minister to accept amendment No. 26, but given the way the debate is going, I have a feeling that it is not going to happen. It is wrong to exclude 40% of the people who are affected. The Minister can make all the arguments as to the difficulty of knowing how the State genuinely apologises for this, but he should certainly not start by excluding a whole bunch of people. That is totally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289"> Amendment No. 63 seeks to ensure that the other institutions that were not covered by the mother and baby home report, of which there are several, are included. We all know of many such places. I do not know the terms of reference of the report off by heart, so I am open to correction, but I imagine that it was supposed to be a sample or a point of reference. I do not believe it should have been just the institutions that were investigated that are eligible for redress. That would make all of the apologies by the State totally meaningless when it comes to paying out the money that would make such a massive difference for so many people. The trauma they have is as a result of the actions of the State in conjunction with the religious institutions. For example, so many people were never able to hold down full-time work. They are in a different financial situation now totally based on the fact that they had this childhood trauma. I totally stand against this, but for the Government to say that a person had to have spent six months in an institution to qualify is wrong. I do not care if I end up saying that 100 times in here tonight. While we have the time and the opportunity we must keep saying it. The same is true of the children who were boarded out and treated so horrifically. We are failing people all over again. I will certainly not have my name attached to that. That is for sure.</p>

          <p eId="para_1290">The point has been made by many here, again and again in this debate, and in previous debates. It is tragic and unacceptable that the Government is not willing to acknowledge the central point that is being made. I will take this last opportunity to dramatise the issue for the Minister about why the exclusion is so completely unacceptable, and fails to acknowledge the human reality that the separation of mother and child involves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291"> One of the features of mother and baby homes is that when children were born in a home, which demonstrates the wrong that was done to the mother and child, is that the nuns required the mother to immediately bandage their breasts so that there would be no bonding at all between the mother and the child. If there was any bonding, that would make it more difficult to take the child away from the mother and <i>vice versa</i>. Can the Minister imagine how traumatic that was for the mother and the child right from the first moment, which is normally a moment of joy for the mother, when the instantaneous and unique bond is created between a newly born baby and his or her mother? However, that was immediately denied. A bond could not be created between the baby and its mother. It goes from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292"> If people think about their own children at one week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks, and that someone snatched their baby out of their hands and said they would not see the baby again, they could imagine the trauma that involves. The idea that we can set a timeline of six months and that before that there is not a trauma or something that deserves to be acknowledged as an abuse and as a crime against the mother and child is utterly incomprehensible. It flies in the face of everything we know about the relationship between a mother and child, and about the development of children and the shaping of a child's character as well as the scar the mother carries from that moment of separation on for the rest of her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293"> The point has been made, but we need to take this last opportunity to appeal to the Government not to do this because it subverts, sabotages and undermines what was supposed to be the acknowledgement of the State of the wrong that was done and the abuse that was perpetrated. It makes hollow all of the apologies or the claim that the Government has learned from this and is serious about redress for all of those who suffered that forced separation - the mothers and the children. It is not too late for the Minister to reconsider.</p>

          <p eId="para_1294">It is St. Brigid's Day. Brigid was a significant woman in Christian and pagan times. I try to take strength from her because we are tired. We do not want to do this but we have no choice. We have listened to people's sheer frustration, upset and disbelief. I lost a little patience with someone I talked to yesterday because I thought that person was still hopeful. I was left in the position of saying we will go through a charade tomorrow with these amendments. I then thought that was not correct and I should not do that, but it was a reflection of my own frustration. People came to Leinster House today with hope. They communicated with us hundreds of times. My staff have worked all this week to reply to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295"> I do not know if the Minister realises the frustration out there. I would prefer to be in the Chair and maybe go home to read a book, but it is my duty, my job and a privilege to stand here, read this material and say it back to the Minister. I do not wish to do that in a personal way but the Minister is standing over a system with so many exclusions, from people of mixed race to those who were boarded out to the six-month requirement. There are so many problems with this legislation. The worst part for me is that it is being done under the guise of upholding human rights when it is exclusionary, divisive and insulting. The six months are purely arbitrary. As I said, Deputy Sherlock should not have bothered minding his child for six months because that is the logic of what the Minister is saying. The Deputy has just invested six months loving his child, with his partner I am sure, but for what purpose? This Government is telling us that is nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296"> The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is present. I have the greatest respect for her but she and the Minister are standing over this system. It is a case of <i>tabula rasa,</i> a blank slate. To help the Minister, I will read a letter into the record and ask the Minister once again what his response to it was and how he justifies the six-month requirement. This letter is very unusual. I worked as a psychologist and many times I pulled out my hair hoping that psychologists and psychiatrists would speak out. Some 32 or 33 of them spoke by putting their names to a letter dated 21 November 2021. which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1297">Dear Minister,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1298">We are writing to you as a specialist group of clinicians working in the area of childhood trauma in Ireland. We are aware that in releasing details of the Mother and Baby Homes redress scheme you have received a number of responses from various quarters to date and we want to add our contribution which is coming from a place of compassion, [missing from the Government], concern and desire [foolishly and naively] to have theory influence policy in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1299">In reading the details of the scheme what strikes us the lack of integration of the latest research regarding childhood trauma and brain development. [Remember that Science Foundation Ireland is constantly telling us about evidence-based research, which I note because these people are struck by] ... the lack of integration of the latest research regarding childhood trauma and brain development, which in turn lead to erroneous conclusions and pathways for those with lived experience of Mother and Baby Homes. The issues are complex but there are a couple of important points ... </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1300">Firstly, childhood trauma, which includes separation from primary caregiver and exposure to multiple caregivers in an institutional setting, has the greatest impact early in childhood. This is due to the rapid growth in brain development at this time and the importance of consistency of adult-child interaction to ensure adequate stimulation for optimal brain growth. We are so fortunate to know so much about this area now thanks to recent developments in neuroscience and attachment [which is completely missing from the Government's approach] and indeed to have clinicians in Ireland who are informed by these principles. However, some information is not entirely new. For instance, we know that early separation from a caregiver is intrinsically stressful and has long-lasting impact throughout the lifespan. Thus, to state that young children, who might have been in Mother and Baby Homes for a period of 2-3 months early in life were less impacted by those who spent longer, is simply not scientifically correct. Indeed, the opposite is true. The earlier the impact of trauma the more ... lasting the effects.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1301">Secondly, [and I will push it] ... having an arbitrary period of 6 months' ... is simply that, arbitrary. What is known from research in the area of childhood trauma is that it is the combination of adversity and quality of relationships which confer risk.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1302">[...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1303">Thirdly, an understanding of the impact of trauma on development allows us to understand how issues are likely to present, depending on the age and [the] stage ... For example, mothers and older children might be able to narrate [and articulate] their experiences ... Those who were babies at the time of experience and consequently ... pre-verbal will not have developed the language and cognitive abilities to narrate [not to understand but narrate] their stories. This leaves these individuals more vulnerable to embodied trauma, that is trauma held and expressed through[out] the body [and so on].</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1304">[...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1305">We are seeking a revision of the recommendations ... [of] the report, with inclusion of best practice guidelines regarding neuroscience, childhood trauma and attachment. [The Minister knows this. I am reading it out for the record but he knows this because he has read it.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1306">[...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1307">One final point. These women and children have experienced complex trauma and adversity in their lives. Yes, the money will help, there's no doubt about it. But there is also an opportunity to right a wrong, to empathise at a human level and seek to understand. We want to minimise the risk of secondary traumatisation and invalidation of survivors and their families which is most likely where experiences are not heard, respected and redressed. Fundamentally, it is about mothers, children and families being seen and heard and having their lived experiences validated. Collectively, we can surely strive for this?</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> How naive it is to think we can collectively strive for this? I would like to think that too. I am becoming more cynical, but there is a duty on me to rise above that cynicism. I appeal to the Minister to go back. Let us do this right. It is a finite number of people and a finite amount of money. We have not even asked the religious orders about this. God knows, they might come forward in a co-operative manner and work with us.</p>

          <p eId="para_1309">I will speak to the amendments in the order in which they were tabled by the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310"> As I outlined on Committee Stage, I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 26. In that context, I am of the view that the provision in section 15 has perhaps been misinterpreted. I will explain its intention. The section provides for a person to make a further application to the scheme in circumstances where another institution in which he or she resided is added to the list of institutions covered by the scheme. In all other circumstances, only one application should be made under the scheme in order to streamline the process for the applicant and enhance the efficiency of the scheme. Where a further application is made under section 15, the intention provided for under this section - the section that would be deleted if this amendment is successful - is to afford the most advantageous calculation possible in assessing the applicant's eligibility for payments and access to health services under the scheme. Therefore, when it benefits applicants to do so, section 15(4)(b) allows for their previous application to the scheme to be decided alongside their new application in order that the total number of days they spent in the combined institutions will be reckonable in affording an enhanced medical card, or a payment, where they had previously not satisfied the eligibility criteria for such benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> By way of example, a person might make an application to the scheme in respect of time spent in an institution listed in Schedule 1. In the context of this application, it is determined this person spent 150 days in the institution as a mother and is entitled to the general payment of €10,000. An additional institution is subsequently added to the scheme. This same applicant also spent time, 80 days, in that institution and makes a second application to the scheme in accordance with section 15. Taking her first and second application together, this applicant, having spent 230 days in total in the institutions, is now also entitled to apply for an enhanced medical card. This provision allows for the best possible and most favourable interpretation in calculating the benefits an applicant gets under this scheme. This amendment would remove that particular section. I do not think that is what Deputies want to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 63. It seeks to give the power to insert an institution into Schedule 1 to the chief deciding officer and to remove the need for the Minister to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when adding institutions to Schedule 1. The scheme covers the institutions considered by the commission of investigation to be the main such homes that existed during the 20th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">The inclusion of an additional institution or institutions in Schedule 1 would expand the scope of the scheme. In that case it would be inappropriate not to seek the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to include additional institutions. It would also not be appropriate for the chief deciding officer to have the authority to expand the scheme as his or her functions are restricted to the operation of the scheme and decision-making in terms of the eligibility of applicants from institutions listed in Schedule 1. The expansion of the coverage of the scheme is a policy matter for the Department to consider in accordance with the specific requirements set out in the legislation and, due to the cost implications of any additions to Schedule 1, for the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to give consent to.</p>

          <p eId="para_1314">The Minister is right on this one in the sense that it is of benefit, but we are all in the position of having to read something very quickly and then trying to fit in everything else we want to talk about because our amendments have been ruled out of order. That is all I have to say. I thank the Minister for the clarification.</p>

          <p eId="para_1316">I move amendment No. 27:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1317">In page 15, line 17, to delete “as soon as practicable” and substitute “within a timeframe of no longer than three months”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">Most of the debate until now has been on the radically contentious and extremely controversial aspects of the Bill and the early years of the survivor's life, and for good reason. The first six months of anybody's life are extremely important. I am shocked that the Government discounts the importance of the relationship between mother and child and the physical effect and the emotional effect it has at that time. The Government's perspective is anti-science and anti-evidence and goes against the experience of every mother in the country. One of the difficulties I have with the Government's approach, and this Bill is an element of the Government's approach, is that the State has a long history of fighting citizens tooth and nail in trying to delay or stop redress. That is one of the reasons the country is now convulsed with the nursing home crisis and the crisis in CervicalCheck. There is not one person who has suffered an adverse experience with this State who does not face a combative, aggressive battle with the State to achieve justice. This is just another iteration of that long-time Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> My worry, and the focus of this amendment, is that many of the survivors are at the other end of their lives. I believe the average age of survivors who would reach even this point in this controversial Bill is 70, which is incredible. It is stunning in all the wrong aspects. Many are not in great health. Many have had their health damaged by their experience with the State. My amendment simply seeks that the redress decision be made within a reasonable period in order that individuals can achieve the redress to which they are entitled and should get. Basically, I do not want to see a person wait for a further elongated period. With all the best will in the world, the State has previous form in delivering all these processes really slowly. The Minister's Bill states "as soon as practicable", but how long is that? Is it six months? Is it 12 months? Does a person have to wait a year or three years, potentially, before this is resolved? This amendment is a sound, fair, common-sense amendment which makes the process set in stone in law.</p>

          <p eId="para_1320">Amendments Nos. 28 and 50 are very similar. They seek to have "as soon as practicable" deleted and substituted with "within 28 days". I say this on foot of the situation with the Birth Information and Tracing Act, where people are waiting far past the recommended time. Unfortunately, just today I spoke to somebody who is still having difficulty getting their information, particularly their medical information, so when I read "as soon as practicable", I think, how long is a piece of string? That is just not acceptable. There needs to be a much tighter timeframe. To substitute those words with the words "within 28 days" is the very least that can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> Amendment No. 30 is specific to people aged 75 or older and seeks that they would be prioritised on the basis of age and that their applications would be processed within 15 days.</p>

          <p eId="para_1322">These amendments - I am speaking to amendment No. 50 in particular - seek to ensure applications are processed in a timely manner. The current wording is too ambiguous and allows for too much scope. Survivors have waited years for any form of justice, and it is essential those who are eligible receive their redress as soon as possible. The only way this is possible is by adding this limit. I have no faith this system will be survivor centred, as with other schemes supposedly to help survivors. This would be bureaucratic and drawn out. We see this already with the immoral delays in people accessing their birth information under the Birth Information and Tracing Act. State bodies instantly interpreted the Act to allow them the maximum time to reply and then cite the exceptional range permitted. If we are to learn from that experience, it is important to add this limit. These amendments are especially important in the context of the Government's refusal to grant interim payments as requested by survivors. The OAK report states that the most commonly held view in respect of financial recognition was that an immediate interim <i>ex gratia</i> common experience payment should be made as urgently as possible. The least the Government should do, after repeatedly ignoring this point, is ensure the timely processing of applications is provided for in the legislation. Also, it should be noted this refers to 28 days in total. That is four weeks, not 28 working days.</p>

          <p eId="para_1331">I support amendment No. 27 in the name of Deputy Tóibín and the other amendments. As my colleague, Deputy Funchion, said, how long is a piece of string? There is a lack of clarity. We have had sad experiences with most elements of our public system now. That extends even to getting a passport or a driving licence, which are totally mundane issues compared with the seriousness of what we are dealing with tonight. There is the impact on people's lives and the age profile of the survivors. The Bill is just not fit for purpose in any manner. I said enough earlier. I support amendment No. 27.</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">I support this proposal. People have waited long enough and there should not be uncertainty over getting a prompt decision. As has been said, we had reports and they were relayed to the Minister here recently. When was it we last discussed this? Was it a few weeks ago? We spoke about people having experienced significant delays in getting their personal information, so there is a problem. In locking this in, at least there will be a clear imperative and obligation on the Government to ensure people get decisions promptly and are not left waiting even longer. They have waited long enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_1333">As I outlined during Committee Stage proceedings, I am not able to accept amendment No. 27 or amendment No. 28. This scheme we are creating will be the largest of its kind established by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">It is important that we are realistic about the timeframes within which the applications under it can be processed. Every intention will be taken to process the applications as speedily as possible. I assure Deputies that everything is being done in my Department to build the administrative infrastructure; operate the scheme and ensure we can have it open as soon as possible after legislation is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> However, this is complex work and the administration of the scheme will require those operating it to engage with tens of thousands of applicants, particularly at the start when the scheme first opens. In many cases, because of the design of the scheme and because proof of residence in an institution will allow an application for many people, for the vast majority of people this will be a simple process. Due to the historic nature of the records, there may be occasions where there are challenges and there will be in the region of 34,000 applications coming in under this scheme. It is not possible to anticipate in every situation whether there may be some barriers to finding the relevant information that is necessary to prove an applicant's residency in an institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> We want to move these applications as quickly as possible but the Bill is being crafted to recognise that there may be some more complicated applications, and in that situation, allowing the chief deciding officer to deal with them as soon as practicable allows for a more realistic timeline than some of the deadlines that are proposed by Deputies today. The Bill proposes to prioritise elderly applicants. If you look at section 16(3)(b), it clearly states the chief deciding officer "may accord priority to the examination of an application where he or she considers that it is in the interest of fairness and efficiency to do so, having regard in particular to the personal circumstances, including the age and state of health, of the applicant". In light of that provision, as we have a clear obligation to consider age and health status, I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 29 or 30. Those points are already reflected within the context of that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> As referenced, in considering all of these proposed amendments and the potential concerns behind them that I acknowledge Deputies are trying to address, I am bringing forward amendment No. 57. This amendment provides within the Bill that "The Minister may issue guidelines for the purpose of providing practical guidance" to those involved in any aspect of the administration or delivery of the scheme. It is anticipated that these guidelines will serve to provide a detailed roadmap on how applications will be handled and the various points where an applicant can expect to hear from the scheme administrators in respect of their applications. Those guidelines will also set out in more detail, stemming from section 16(3)(b), how the prioritisation process operated by the chief deciding officer will work.</p>

          <p eId="para_1338">The State has much previous form in fighting people to the very end. With the CervicalCheck scandal, the State fought women in court up until the time they died. Many people have felt that in the past, the State has prolonged redress and justice for financial reasons. We see that the Government is wedded to the protection of its financial interests over its moral interests. Many people have died already while waiting for redress. It would be incredible to think we would have an open-ended process. If we need to employ people to get the job done at the right speed, then that should be the priority. What are the staff numbers that are likely to be working in this process to make sure it happens in time?</p>

          <p eId="para_1482">I thank members of our usher staff, who are unfailingly helpful to us, for having brought to my attention earlier the fact that a Deputy is celebrating his 40th anniversary as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas this week. The Deputy in question served for four years in Seanad Éireann and has served for 36 years in this House. Deputy Brendan Howlin has contributed enormously over those years to these Houses. His dignity and integrity have always been his outstanding features, and his contribution to public life in Ireland has been without parallel. Let us give him a round of applause.</p>
