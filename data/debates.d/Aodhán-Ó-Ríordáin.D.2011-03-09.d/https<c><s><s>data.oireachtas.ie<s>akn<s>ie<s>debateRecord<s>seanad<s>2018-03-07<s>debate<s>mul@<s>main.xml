          <heading>Garda Deployment<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T10:40:00+00:00"/></heading>
          <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">There is rarely a day when policing scandals are not front page news. From made-up figures to the smear campaign against whistleblowers, it is frankly becoming an issue that even the Government cannot spin its way out of. Crime is rampant and people are suffering, including the ordinary garda on the street. It is within that context that I have asked for the Minister to be present and to comment on the shocking cut of 136 gardaí in my area of Dublin South-Central.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> I will start with some information I collected from a constituency-wide survey I carried out last year. When asked what was the biggest issue for the area, 20% of people said anti-social behaviour. Crime, dumping, drugs, gangland activity and murder accounted for 36% of answers. There is no doubt those issues have not been dealt with because of the lack of gardaí. When asked what people would change about the area, one constituent referred to anti-social behaviour and a lack of Garda presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The nitty-gritty of the cuts the Minister has imposed on Dublin South-Central are as follows. Kevin Street station has lost a massive 52 gardaí in the past seven years. Crumlin and Sundrive Road stations have lost 24 gardaí over the past seven years, and the number of gardaí in Ballyfermot station has reduced to 16. Last year the acting Garda Commissioner said that Ballyfermot would be one of the areas where a new Garda station would be opened rather than the suspect decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station. What possible justification is there for such cuts? There simply is not one. Saving money to spend on a Government spin unit is not of equal worth to the safety and security of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The details of the cuts to the number of gardaí is as follows. Dublin South-Central has lost 31 Garda sergeants since 2010. A newspaper ran a story only last week about the predicted crisis nationally from the delay in recruiting new Garda sergeants. Why should that be imposed on the people of Dublin South-Central? What about community gardaí? Nationally, the number of community gardaí in the force has fallen from 1,112 in 2010 to only 691 in 2017, a decrease of 38%. That shows the Government has no interest in investing in community policing although that is the future. Community gardaí are at the front line in tackling anti-social behaviour and creating good community relations. Having community gardaí can be transformative for communities. A good community garda can make connections, build relationships and work with the people in a community. In spite of that, Dublin South-Central went from having 99 community gardaí in 2011 to only 30 last year. That is a significant drop and the community is paying for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The effect of the drastic lack of numbers means gardaí experience fear on the streets. It is dangerous for the force not to know whether backup is needed in dangerous situations. Sinn Féin submitted a comprehensive document on the future of policing last month. I wonder whether the Minister read it. In it, we made more than 50 recommendations for the reform of policing. Those included reversing cuts to community gardaí, but there were also measures to strengthen accountability and protect whistleblowers. I urge the Minister to read it if he has not already done so.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I should say at the outset that the distribution of gardaí is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no direct role in the matter. I am informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda division, including the Dublin metropolitan region, south-central division, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I am further informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that the overall strength of the DMR, south-central division, as of the 31 January 2018 was 612. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí in the south-central division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the armed support unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Senators will be aware that the closure of the Garda College in Templemore in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across the country in all divisions. Since the Government reopened the college in Templemore in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána and have been assigned to mainstream duties across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Of those, 719, or 45%, have been assigned to Dublin, of whom 141 have been assigned to the south-central division.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Senators will appreciate that the challenges presented by gangland crime in the Dublin area have necessitated additional investment in the specialist units to enhance their capacity to support the fight against this scourge. I am advised by the acting Garda Commissioner that extra gardaí have been assigned to the specialist units over recent months, including the drugs and organised crime bureau, which is particularly active in the fight against organised crime in the Dublin region. In addition, a dedicated armed support unit for the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, was established at the end of 2016 to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and free up the resources of the emergency response unit. I understand that the allocation of resources to these units has affected disproportionately the number of divisional gardaí in the Dublin region. This will be one of the factors taken into account by the acting Commissioner when considering the allocation of new Garda recruits. I am pleased to say that 200 new gardaí will pass out of the Garda College next week and be assigned to locations around the country, with a particular focus on the Dublin region.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, including on the streets of our capital city, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. Real and tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of more than 600 since the end of 2016. I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce. This year, a further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College in Templemore, with 200 having already entered since 29 January. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, with 200 due to attest next week. Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities, enhance visibility within our communities and enable the acting Commissioner to provide additional resources across the DMR, including the south-central division, as new Garda recruits come on stream.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The Minister stated that the distribution of gardaí was "exclusively the statutory responsibility for the Garda Commissioner". As an elected Deputy and someone who has been appointed to the position of Minister for Justice and Equality, though, surely he should take a more hands-on approach to the root-and-branch reform of the Garda, especially given the scandals. He needs to have a more direct role. We have seen the skewed and inappropriate behaviour at some levels within the Garda Síochána. Perhaps the Minister should have more of a guiding input into how the reform is undertaken. It is doubtful that the scandals of last year can be put to bed at this stage, but I call on the Minister to be more proactive with the Garda after the necessary root-and-branch reform. In the meantime, we need to invest in the Garda in Dublin South-Central, which has increased in terms of its population and, unfortunately, crime levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">"Hands on" one day is "political interference" the next. I assure the House that the Government's focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of the Garda. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the acting Commissioner with the appropriate level of resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of gardaí across divisions, including the south-central division. In addition to the Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000, the investment in personnel is complemented by a substantial investment in resources across the board. A total budget of €1.65 billion has been provided to the Garda this year, an increase of 2% on 2017. Some €98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime this year, representing an increase of €10 million on 2017's initial allocation. It should be noted that the Garda allocation continues to benefit from the significant additional funding that was provided in 2016 and maintained in 2017 to fund a sustained response to gangland crime and the continuation of Operation Thor and measures to prevent international terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Some €342 million, including €217 million in additional funding under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. This investment will continue under my watch and facilitate the provision of more effective policing services. I expect that the south-central division, like all other Garda divisions, will continue to benefit from the new resources that are now becoming available.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Cathaoirleach's office for selecting this Commencement matter. I warmly welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy Phelan. To get to the kernel of this Commencement matter, there has been media coverage in recent days relating to the proposal or suggestion of an elected executive mayor for the Dublin area, including the commuter belt towns of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath. That this has been reported is not to say it is fact, but it was published in the media. There was also the suggestion of a directly elected executive mayor for Cork city and county. Will the Minister of State outline the facts of this case?</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> I wish to home in on the question of devolving powers. It is a great idea, but from whom are we taking those powers and to whom are we giving them? With devolved power comes devolved responsibility. Who are we taking responsibility from and to whom are we giving it? With devolved power comes funding, with the implications of that for the local property tax and commercial rates. Who are we taking the funding from and to whom are we giving it? To whom will these people be accountable?</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I would appreciate it if the Minister of State shared with us his vision in this regard, throw some light on the facts and tell us how the Government intends, if it intends at all, to proceed with having elected mayors. Will they be figureheads or executive elected mayors? There is a subtle but important difference.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">I apologise for being late. Traffic on the Naas Road is unpredictable at the best of times and chaotic at the worst.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter. A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a number of requirements in terms of local government reform, some of which we have discussed previously. In particular, it envisages the submission of a report to the Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, all of the issues that the Senator referenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Proposals to address a number of the programme for Government requirements have been the subject of consideration by the Government, most recently last week, in light of which it is envisaged that the matters involved will be referred to the Oireachtas for consideration. Among the issues being addressed in this context is municipal governance, including the questions of town or borough status and local electoral areas, as referenced in the programme for Government. Pending referral of the matters involved to the Oireachtas, I am not in a position to provide full details on them, but I am prepared to have a further discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The Department is preparing a report on the programme for Government commitment on directly elected mayors for Dublin and Cork. This paper will examine the range of functions that might be assigned to a directly elected mayor and the governance structure that would underpin the role. Of importance is the geographic area relevant both to the mayoral role and the electorate that would vote for it. Consideration must also be given to potential impacts on existing local government structures following on from the establishment of directly elected mayors in those city areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> At its meeting on 26 September 2017, the Government agreed as part of an indicative schedule for a number of referendums over the next 18 months that a plebiscite on directly elected mayors could take place in October 2018. The Department is drafting the legislation required to give effect to this decision and it is included in the Government's legislative programme as a Bill to be published in the first half of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">I also note that proposals brought to the Government and the Oireachtas on directly elected mayors will need to be cognisant of the new national planning framework and its strong focus on sustainable unpacked development of Ireland's cities and urban areas. Work on the report on directly elected mayors for cities is at an advanced stage in the Department. I thank the Senator for his interest in the matter. </p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Local government performs a wide range of functions and delivers a broad array of services. Any change must strengthen it and ensure it will remain fit for purpose. I also take the opportunity to thank the staff and membership of local authorities across the country who responded so effectively in the past few days to events during Storm Emma. </p>
            <p eId="para_41"> In the case of Cork city and in respect of the newly expanded boundary which has not yet been provided for in law but which will, it is hoped, come into effect in the middle of the year with a local government Bill, it seems pretty clear, based on the geographic area, where a directly elected mayor will operate. In Dublin some people believe a directly elected mayor should just be for the city; others believe he or she should be for the four Dublin authorities, while others believe the area should stretch to include the three neighbouring authorities in counties Meath, Wicklow and Kildare. There is the question of whether such a role should slot into a similar pattern as in the case of the existing local government heads rather than have executive power. In the case of Dublin and Cork, that would mean a change in the role of the chief executives in these organisations. A directly elected mayor would have these powers and carry out these functions for the term for which he or she was elected. All of these matters are being considered. It will be another month before the report goes to the Government and it will include the options. The Government will make its decision and there will then be a discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I thank the Minister of State. There is still a lot more work to be done, from which I am not taking away. The Minister of State used the term "plebiscite". Whatever decision is made, there has to be change. We should never be afraid of change, but it is important that, in respect of local democracy and government, we initiate a plebiscite. There is now a connection with local property tax and for the first time people believe they are putting their hands in their pockets. It is to be hoped there will come a time when all taxes gathered locally will be retained locally, but we are a long way from that happening. Where I live, money is being handed the other way. Empowering people through a plebiscite is a very important aspect of any change. I again thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this matter. </p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I commend the work of the Transgender Equality Network of Ireland, TENI, and the #ThisIsMe campaign which has been raising issues about a clinic for some time. I also commend the work of the Department and the HSE which have committed to the provision of additional resources for the clinic which should help to make an impact on waiting lists. However, there is currently only one full-time public endocrinologist who is based in St. Columcille’s Hospital, Loughlinstown with expertise in hormone replacement therapy, HRT, who serves the needs of adult transgender people in the State. The number of posts will soon be increased to two. There is also a part-time clinic in University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, with very limited hours. Owing to HSE policy, HRT is only administered to trans people at these two clinics, despite the fact that HRT prescribed for cisgender people or in any other instance can be administered and monitored by a local GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> In the clinic in Loughlinstown there is a two-year waiting list. The waiting time has been attributed, not to service users but to the cancelling of clinics by consultants and the enforcement of the medical and diagnostic model by the HSE. The additional resources can be largely offset as the lead consultant within the clinic, Professor O’Shea, takes on the role of clinical lead for obesity. While I hope waiting times will improve, all of the indications point to the fact that the clinic will continue to be stretched beyond capacity. It is also worth noting that those aged 16 or 17 years who wish to apply for a gender recognition certificate must have supporting documentation from the clinic which will only accept referrals from certain psychiatrists who also have strained waiting times. </p>
            <p eId="para_46"> The model of a full-time Dublin-centric clinic meeting the needs of a community spread across the State is one that contravenes international best practice, namely, the World Professional Association for Transgender Healthcare, WPATH, guidelines which are the standard for most developed countries and also in keeping with the European Social Charter. It is not viable for a Dublin-centric clinic to support the needs of our island-wide trans community. It is fair to say the current position has led to a spike in mental health issues and the incidence of suicidal ideation among vulnerable persons and a rise in unmonitored self-treatment where individuals are forced or opt to buy hormones online.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The NTPF publishes the inpatient and outpatient waiting list figures by specialty and hospital each month. This information is available on <i>ntpf.ie.</i> The most recent figures published by the NTPF for January 2018 indicate that there is a total of 38 people on the national inpatient day case waiting list for endocrinology and a total of 9,339 on the outpatient waiting list for endocrinology. Of this figure, almost 1,900 are on the waiting list at St. Columcille’s Hospital. Figures show that 42% of these patients have been on the waiting list for 12 months or less. Almost 40% have been on it for 18 months or more. However, I am advised by the HSE that urgent referrals are usually accommodated within four to six weeks. It is important to highlight that the NTPF waiting list data are extracted from the overall waiting list figures for the specialty and do not differentiate specific procedures for transgender patients from procedures for other patients on waiting lists. Reducing waiting times for the patients who have been waiting the longest is one of the Government’s key priorities. Consequently, in budget 2018, €55 million was allocated for the NTPF. This significant increase in funding almost trebles its 2017 total allocation of €20 million.  To date, the transgender service in Loughlinstown has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and all referrals are managed within general endocrinology OPD clinics. The service is operated between the psychiatry services, primarily in Cluain Mhuire, and the endocrinology service in St. Columcille’s Hospital. Patients who require an endocrinology assessment must have been initially assessed and referred by a consultant psychiatrist. The psychiatry clinics are held weekly in St. Columcille’s Hospital and can accept only one new referral per week. </p>
            <p eId="para_49"> It is welcome that the HSE has, as part of its 2018 budget, allocated funding of €100,000 to St. Columcille’s Hospital which will ensure dedicated funding for transgender services and see increased capacity within psychiatry and psychology services. This will increase the capacity of the clinic to see additional referrals. The HSE has advised that recruitment to fill the additional new posts at St. Columcille’s Hospital will commence in early 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The existing care pathway for transgender people in accessing HRT follows international best practice. The guidelines were devised by experts in transgender health care, with members of the international transgender, transsexual and LGBT community, and supported by TENI. The care pathway generally begins with an approach by an individual to his or her GP. The GP may refer the person to the local community mental health team for support and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist. A thorough assessment is a prerequisite to commencing hormone suppressers. This is to ensure the correct path is being taken for the individual and comorbidity issues are identified and addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">It would be inappropriate for me as Minister to comment on the assessment process as this is a matter between clinical personnel and the individual concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">The waiting list time and the admission that this service has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis proves that this model simply is not working or is not economical in the long term. I accept that the waiting list data are extracted and do not differentiate specific procedures for transgender patients. However, if we accept that there are 1,900 people on the waiting list and compare that figure with the number of people who have availed of a gender recognition certificate in this State, which would be about 300, although I do not know the number off the top of my head, those numbers are staggering in comparison with those who have availed of a gender recognition certificate, so that is a concern. As I said in my opening speech, it is not international best practice for a service to be so Dublin-centric and to not be available around the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Will the Minister of State commit to working with the Department and the HSE to ascertain if we can broaden access for hormone replacement therapy? What medical professionals would be able to administer and monitor the treatment? Will the Minister of State request that the Minister meet TENI and the This is Me campaign? The need to meet the Minister results from the fact that all the correspondence that TENI, the community or we get is from the Loughlinstown clinic itself. There is a bit of silence on the part of the Department, so that is a concern given that there were hundreds on the streets of Dublin at the beginning of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I reiterate that recruitment is taking place, as I alluded to in my speech. This involves one consultant endocrinologist, one social worker, one speech and language therapist, two senior psychologists, one clinical nurse specialist and one grade five. Some of them will be whole-time equivalents and some will be part time. That should help the waiting lists but I will certainly pass on the Senator's concerns to both the Department and the HSE. I will also pass on to the Minister the Senator's request that he meet TENI at the first opportunity.</p>

My Commencement matter relates to the proposal in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, for a new hospital in Cork. The priority is not long fingering it and leaving it as just a proposal. I want action to be taken. The population of Cork has increased from 410,000 to 542,000 in the past 30 years. It will continue to grow under Project Ireland 2040. Cork city and county will be the fastest growing area of the country. Therefore, there is a need for improved medical facilities and one of those facilities is a new hospital.

            <p eId="para_57">I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the Seanad on the proposals in the recently published national development plan with regard to a new hospital in Cork. The health service capacity review, which was published on 23 January 2018, identifies additional capacity requirements in our health service and also makes it clear that, in the absence of major reforms, the demand on our hospital system in particular will become unsustainable. The review clearly states that, together with reformed models of care, we need extra capacity across acute hospitals and primary and social care. It concludes that acute hospital bed capacity will need to increase by 2,600. I am delighted that the very significant increases in capital funding in the health service as a result of the national development plan will allow us to deliver on this capacity as well as on a range of other health capital projects and programmes across acute, primary and social care.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> Under the national development plan, capital funding for our health services will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was for the past ten years. This is a sea change commitment to capital investment in our health services. A total of €10.9 billion over the next ten years provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care, and modernise how we deliver health services. The new hospital for Cork is one of the major investment projects promised in the national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> It is important to recognise that the national development plan is a long-term plan. It provides for a large number of health developments throughout the country, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and social care. Many of its proposals are at an early stage of development, including the new hospital for Cork. Further planning to progress the investment in a new hospital for Cork will now be undertaken. This will include full evaluation of local capacity and infrastructural needs as well as a framework for decision-making on the optimal location from a clinical and population needs perspective. For all projects, we must ensure that we carefully plan the use of all capital funding using robust methods of appraisal, assessment and selection to meet population needs and achieve value for money. In this way, the unprecedented health capital investment of €10.9 billion over the next ten years will allow the health services to provide the necessary infrastructure and equipment to support the Government's vision for a high-quality, safe, accessible and sustainable health care system into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">Unfortunately, the reply that was furnished to the Minister of State by the Department and the HSE does not actually deal with the question. The question is quite specific. I just asked what process has been put in place to identify the site. It is important that we establish a group or that a process is clearly identified to identify this site and move forward with this project. I suggest that I be allowed to raise this issue again to allow the Minister of State to get further information so that we can find out whether this is just on paper at the moment, whether some process has started, if one has not started, when it will start, and the target date for identifying a site. This is important information for me because I do not want to be raising the same matter in 12 months with nothing done.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">I appreciate the Senator's sentiments and that my response was rather vague on detail at this stage. If the Cathaoirleach is happy to allow the matter to be raised again in the House, I am happy to come back and get more detail for the Senator. I have some knowledge of it as a Minister of State from the area and had some discussions with the hospital group on the future of this hospital before the national development plan was announced. One thing I remember being struck by at that meeting was that one of the difficulties and challenges faced by the HSE, and I appreciate that this is a separate debate, was having to deal with two separate local authorities when discussing issues of infrastructure, sites and support services. Be that as it may, there is nothing we can do about that in this forum. I am happy to get further information for the Senator on the specifics of the process involved in identifying a site.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">In the aftermath of Storm Emma we have been left with considerable chaos with respect to two topics I wish to raise today. Both relate to shortages, the first a shortage of water and the second a shortage of blood. Regarding water shortages, we have learned from the Kennedy analysis that we have a 57% leakage rate in Dublin. We know that Dublin's pipes are ancient, corroded, full of holes and generally not fit for purpose. We also know that in London, which has leakage rates of less than half of what we have in Dublin, they are replacing their old Victorian water mains. To date, Irish Water has no such plans. Instead it is planning on a mega project to pump water 172 km from the River Shannon to Dublin. No doubt this is a great plan which would give us a sustainable water source into the future, but surely we need to start replacing our old water mains and Victorian pipes at the very least. What is the point in pumping water into leaky pipes? It does not make any sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Dublin 12, 8 and 6W have some of the oldest pipes in the city, which corresponds with the fact that Dublin 12, 8 and 6W have some of the oldest and most beautiful homes in the city, and they have been most affected by the water shortages to date. Local shops in Dublin South-Central have literally run out of bottled water, a sight one would not see in Third World countries. There has been some confusion of late in the media regarding the use of the word "demand". People are not using more water. On average, Irish people use less water than households in the UK. The term is being used interchangeably with the term "leakages". The recent weather and the result of freeze-thaw action has seen a further deterioration in old Dublin pipes and drains.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I call on the Government to make a commitment to this House to replace the old Victorian mains in my beloved city. I also want to echo a call made by my party colleague, Councillor Paul McAuliffe for Irish Water to publish daily information on treated water levels in our capital. As our former Taoiseach used to say, "Paddy likes to know".</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The second issue I wish to raise is that of the blood supply in this city. With people confined to their homes during the storm, blood donations fell and that has put serious pressure on blood supplies. Many cancer patients know, as do their family members, the importance of blood donation and blood supply for cancer treatment. My father, over the course of his 15 years of illness, would have had to receive litres of blood from generous blood donors throughout the country. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service stated on Tuesday that it has three days' supply of common blood types of regular blood and only two days' supply of blood group O. Its aim is to collect 7,000 donations between now and St. Patrick's Day. If people are suitable donors, I ask that they make their way to their local blood donation clinic. It is very important that we increase our supply, especially in light of the fact that we have 600 people waiting on trolleys to be treated around the country and there is a bottleneck with respect to supply due to the storm. I request the Leader to call on the Minister to make this happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">I wish to raise two issues, one relates to Dún Laoghaire Harbour and the second relates to the Seanad by-election. I will deal first with the issue of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. For those who may have read today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, they would have seen pictures in it of decimated, bashed up, collapsed concrete in Dún Laoghaire Harbour as a result of the recent storms. That sets the context in terms of other political and financial storms that have affected this harbour. To set the context for this, Dún Laoghaire is one of the biggest harbours in Europe and one of the best harbours in the world, and is recognised as such. It comprises 250 acres within the harbour walls. The piers are each a little less than a mile long and that represents 100 ha. It is an enormous national asset for this country but particularly for sailing.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> There has been no commercial activity in the harbour. It was the subject of much debate with respect to the ports policy, at which time the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - our harbours come under that Department - was the current Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar. A decision was taken to transfer control of small ports of regional significance to the local authorities. It was decided that control of this harbour would be transferred to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Yesterday a very extensive meeting took place with the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county councillors to consider an independent due diligence report on the liabilities that would come with that transfer of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The transfer is mandatory. That is covered in the legislation. There is no choice. As a result of an independent due diligence, validated by the Department, the council is now faced with a cost of €34 million to cover the liabilities, of which €1.4 million relates to liabilities concerning a pension fund for employees that are on the books. The sum of €34 million is an enormous amount of money. I call on the Government to have a debate on the matter, in particular with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to whom I will speak in the coming days if I can. The Government must set aside a capital reserve to assist the local authority in taking on this asset. It cannot just wash its hands of a State company by handing it to a local authority while it has €34 million in liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> To provide some context, the local authority was informed yesterday that if it were to take on those liabilities the impact would be an increase of 4% in commercial rates and an 8% increase in local property tax next year right across the county. The harbour is unique and special. I appeal to the Leader to arrange to have a debate or perhaps I need to raise the matter as part of the Commencement debate. The issue is an important one and I have been asked by local authority members to raise it, which is why I speak about it this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Could the Leader inform the House whether he has any knowledge of the intentions of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government this week - not next week - to sign and trigger the order to give effect to a by-election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of the outgoing Senator Denis Landy on the agricultural panel? I understand such an order is imminent and I think we should know. If the Leader does not know perhaps he could find out and tell the House later or tomorrow as the information is important and we should know it.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">I rise today to talk about the impact of the recent weather on the farming community. I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would come to the House to discuss what emergency plan he has put in place, in particular to deal with the fodder crisis, which has been ongoing for some months but because of the weather we have had in the past week the crisis has escalated and it needs an immediate response. The Minister must look north of the Border to examine the funds that were put in place there when farmers experienced hardship. The crisis is not confined to fodder. Sheds have collapsed and people have had to destroy milk. An emergency package must be put in place for farm families which form the backbone of many rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I also wish to speak about yesterday's meeting of the finance committee which was attended by Commissioner Oettinger who spoke about the EU budget. He told us about the proposed reduction in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, funding to meet the €5 billion gap that will be created following Brexit. The Commissioner said he has travelled around many member states and the people to whom he has spoken have referred to reductions of up to 30% in the CAP budget. That is absolutely unacceptable. The Commission must look beyond CAP in terms of the gap that will be left by Brexit. It can look, for instance, at reducing the EU militarisation programme. The average income of a farmer in the west of Ireland is perhaps a little more than €3,000 a year and it is not acceptable to expect his direct payments to be reduced while increasing the budget for EU militarisation. That is not what the EU talks about in terms of incorporating the views of all member states and being all-inclusive in its approach. We must stand up for agriculture and agricultural families in this country and for the role they play in rural areas. In terms of food security, we will not know how valuable farmers really are until they are gone. Too many family farms have been destroyed because of Government policies and due to inaction by the EU. We have an opportunity to address that during the CAP review. Currently, 80% of CAP payments are directed to 20% of the highest earners in agriculture and that wrong must be righted in the CAP review as well.</p>

I also welcome the Supreme Court decision announced today reversing the decision of Mr. Justice Humphreys in the High Court in so far as he ruled on the rights of the unborn extending beyond Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution. I listened with great interest to the Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke's summary of the judgment and I look forward to reading the lengthy judgment in more detail, but it is clear from the summary that the judgment does provide the necessary legal clarity to enable us to move forward swiftly to bring in the legislation necessary to hold the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. I look forward to the referendum legislation being before us in this House in early course. If he can, I ask the Leader to provide a suggested timeframe. I accept it is early days yet as the judgment has only just been delivered but it does provide the necessary legal clarity and I welcome the ratio, the key aspect of the judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I also welcome the Leader's scheduling today of a series of statements on women's suffrage to mark the centenary of women's suffrage. The statements will commence at 2.30 p.m. today and I look forward to taking part in the debate. It will give us all an opportunity to reflect on the series of events being run in the Oireachtas to mark what we are calling Vótáil 100, the 100th anniversary of women obtaining the right to vote. It is a very significant year and clearly a very significant centenary and we have a number of very important events of which colleagues will already be aware and will support throughout the year. I welcome the opportunity to have that debate. I think we should also use it to mark the necessity of ensuring that we have increased numbers of women representatives in the Oireachtas in future years and to look at ways in which we can increase women's representation in politics.

In October 2016 we in the Seanad led the way in agreeing a cross-party motion condemning the bombardment of Aleppo, which we brought to the attention of the Russian ambassador, given the complicity of the Russian regime in Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime in Syria.

          <p eId="para_95"> I rise today to highlight what I believe to be good and clarifying news.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">This week, the European Court of Justice ruled that investor-state dispute mechanisms, which have been discussed previously in the House, in particular, the intra-European mechanisms, are incompatible with European law. The court, the highest court in this area, has found that the rulings of arbitration courts to award compensation are incompatible with the European treaties. The specific case on which it ruled this week involved a decision requiring the Slovakian Government to pay more than €25 million to a private company. This is the third significant ruling on this matter. The European Court of Justice ruled previously that the European Commission was wrong to believe it could bypass national state ratification of trade deals. It has also ruled that the Commission was wrong not to engage with a large-scale citizens' petition in respect of trade deals, specifically the investor court system that has been found to exercise a chilling effect in important areas of health, environmental, social and equality regulation in many countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Belgium has lodged a case with the European Court of Justice related to the investor court system, which is a new version of the investor state dispute mechanism proposed as part of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. These mechanisms are clearly not working. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on alternatives to trade deals such as CETA and TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The House should discuss how we can move past this failed model for doing trade and ensure we have trade that works for citizens and not only corporations. </p>
          <p eId="para_98"> The House will later discuss the issue of suffrage. I am proud to have been part of the Vótáil 100 committee.

          <p eId="para_99">It is important that the Oireachtas marks appropriately the occasion of 100 years of women's suffrage in Ireland. Before raising a couple of other significant historical events we should also remember, I find it astonishing and highly ironic that Fianna Fáil Party Senators have complained about leaking pipes and water shortages in Dublin. I remind them that the purpose of establishing Irish Water was to invest in water infrastructure and modernise the water network. What did Fianna Fáil do during the general election campaign? It undermined all the progress made in this area in the interest of populist politics. It is a little rich, therefore, to hear Senators from that party complain during a crisis when all of these matters were meant to have been addressed by now.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> I raise a significant event and an important person in Irish history. This day 180 years ago - on 7 March 1848 - our national flag, the tricolour, was flown for the first time at the Wolfe Tone Confederate Club at 33 The Mall, Waterford City, by the Irish patriot, Thomas Francis Meagher. In April 1848, Meagher stated: "The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between Orange and Green, and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood." The Seanad should pause and reflect on these significant words which are as relevant today as they were in 1848. This Republic should respect all traditions and religions and we should remember the legacy of Thomas Francis Meagher, a Waterford man. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Another significant point in history was the centenary yesterday of the death of the great Irish parliamentarian, John Redmond. This week a number of commemorative events will be held in Dublin, Waterford and Wexford to mark Redmond's death. As Senators will be aware, Redmond was the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party for more than 18 years and made a significant contribution to politics in this country. He was involved in negotiations with landlords to transfer land ownership to tenant farmers. This legacy endures and should be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Redmond was often criticised for his interest in the British war effort. In modern Ireland, we have a better understanding of the reasons Irish people fought in the First World War and we must respect those reasons. Whether we agree or disagree with Redmond's views, we should remember and mark his legacy both in Parliament and the country. His life will be marked in Waterford this weekend in a conference featuring a number of important speakers who will do his memory justice. </p>

          <p eId="para_103">The scale of community spirit or meitheal was evident throughout the recent storm and is still much in evidence. The Garda, ambulance service, fire service, Defence Forces and other front-line staff rightly received much praise but an entire army of other people, who I would describe as good neighbours and great citizens, also deserves praise. Many people were left on their own, cut off entirely from the family and friends who normally visit but were unable to do so. After four or five days, the solitude and sense of confinement and isolation will have been overwhelming. Let us imagine how those who experience this every day, with no end in sight, must feel. Last year, as part of a campaign to highlight the impact of loneliness a young man, Joseph Lindoe, spent a week alone at home in the United Kingdom to find out what it was like for the thousands of people who go this long without speaking to anyone. Mr. Lindoe did not have access to the Internet or a telephone and did not have any means of communicating with other people. He documented this time on video and in his own words he felt "truly trapped". Mr. Lindoe was able to count down his days until freedom but for many people who are lonely or isolated, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I will post his harrowing video on social media later and I urge all Senators to take a moment to watch it.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> I echo the sentiments expressed by Mr. Seán Moynihan, chief executive officer of the Alone charity, with whom I worked on the loneliness task force. Mr. Moynihan has asked all of us to maintain the community spirit evident in the past week. We all have a better understanding now of what it is like for some people all year around who cannot get out, do not have company and lack some of the supports and services they need. </p>
          <p eId="para_105"> On behalf of my party, I welcome the St. Brigid's home school liaison team and members of other teams from the Coombe area who are visiting the Seanad today. </p>

          <p eId="para_106">Some former colleagues of the Leader and myself will once again stand outside the gates of Leinster House today seeking equality of pay in the education system. As everyone knows, we cannot fix the wrongs that led the country on a trail of destruction from 2008 until 2012 or thereabouts. The problem we have is that the salary available will not entice people to enter education. The cost of training has gone through the roof because the period of training has increased to two years and the State provides no assistance. In many of the English newspapers, we see advertisements enticing people to move to England, have their teacher training costs paid for and receive a salary that provides a reasonable living standard. We must do something in education because we are losing the best as the system bites. While I acknowledge the problem cannot be fixed overnight, a clear indication must be given to teachers that better times lie ahead. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> On the matter of women's suffrage, as the brother of eight sisters, a husband and a father of one daughter and grandfather of one granddaughter, it is great that we will celebrate women's suffrage today. It is also great that we have seen some degree of equality. While I do not like to generalise, it is great that the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a female and that women are making serious inroads into society. The one area of life in which they are not making inroads is politics. To make it in politics a woman must be better than the best. If we are discussing women's suffrage one hundred years after it was introduced, we should have a look around both Houses of the Oireachtas because we are not there yet. Unfortunately, I will not be present for the debate on women's suffrage as I must attend a committee meeting. We need to start at the top and work our way down, as has been done in the trade union movement where a number of general secretaries are now female. Unfortunately, the number is still not half enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Another problem I experienced in my previous role in the trade union movement is that we do not create an environment that makes it easy for women to enter trade union politics or politics in general. I recall women resigning from the national executive of my union because all meetings were held in Dublin and they had to get home to their children by a reasonable hour. </p>
          <p eId="para_109">However, meetings of the executive often went on until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. Similarly, female Members of the Oireachtas have to return to work immediately after having a child. There is no maternity leave for politicians. We must start looking at how we can be more equal in terms of how our colleagues are treated. Grand statements will be made today but I would love to see some action.</p>

It is a landmark decision and will allow us to move forward to a May referendum without delay. The only constitutional right to life is that which the Supreme Court has identified: that contained in the eighth amendment. That was unanimously and clearly articulated by the Supreme Court. I urge all Members to accept the judgment in good faith and to move forward in a civilised and respectful manner, as has been the case for the most part to date. We must focus on ensuring that we set a date for the referendum. My sincere hope is for a constructive, factual and respectful national discussion on the issue and for the Irish people to finally have their say.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Noone and urge the Leader to ensure this Chamber does everything required to ensure we do not miss the deadline of the referendum date. I very much welcome the decision made by the Supreme Court this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I wish to raise the issue of a decision last Monday by the board of Trinity College Dublin to introduce a flat fee of €450 for supplemental exams, also known as repeat exams. The introduction of fees for supplemental exams was always going to cause some upset but I do not believe anyone could have expected the outrageous figure of €450. To put it into context, UCD charges €230 per exam, while UCC caps its charge at €245, regardless of how many exams a student resits. Some students already fail exams because of financial uncertainty and instability in their lives as they juggle long hours and part-time jobs. This is a cruel further pressure upon such students. The introduction of the charge will disproportionately affect the students already most at risk of dropping out for financial reasons. When one considers that Ireland has the second-highest third level fees in Europe and that students fork out more than €10,000 for accommodation during the academic year, it is clear this new financial cost will price more students out of an education.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The decision was made against the will of the students' union. In a preferendum held earlier this year, 80% of students voted to oppose fees for supplemental exams. Their voices have been ignored and they have been disrespected in the name of financial gain for the university. I understand the students' union is now considering strike action, boycotting services, protesting in front arch-----</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I wish to draw the attention of Members to this being brain awareness week. Some 800,000 people in Ireland have neurological conditions. The campaign involves organisations such as the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, the Migraine Association of Ireland, Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, MS Ireland, Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, the Parkinson's Association of Ireland, the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland, Enable Ireland, the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and it is important to name them. Some or all Members know of those organisations and the work they do. The House has dealt with issues related to their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> People in Ireland may have to wait up to two years to see a neurologist. We have 34 neurologists but should have approximately twice as many. Things have improved over the years but we still have quite a way to go in this area. Specialist nurses is another area in which there are significant deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> The brain awareness week campaign is looking for an investment in neurology, which must happen because it would lead to better outcomes for people and a reduction in cost and the suffering endured as a result of the debilitating nature of these conditions. I commend those organisations and groups on organising the awareness week and bringing it to the attention of Members and I request that the Leader organise a debate with the Minister on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I wish to acknowledge, as have many Members, the efforts made by communities in regard to the recent storm. Public services such as the Garda Síochána, Civil Defence and medical services did a fantastic job but in many ways communities rallied together to ensure older or younger people were safe, which must be acknowledged. I particularly acknowledge the farming community for clearing the roads. In my part of the world, there was snow of up to 2 m in depth and we would be still entrenched in it were it not for the farming community becoming involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I wish to raise what is a very important issue in Cork, which is going through a major process of the consideration of an extension of the city boundary. We have also had the 2020 vision for Ireland and must consider what it is we want for Cork. However, the lack of joined-up thinking between the two local authorities in Cork is a major issue which has again been highlighted in publications in the past week in respect of a planning application for a major development in a county council local authority area that is being processed through the strategic housing development route to An Bord Pleanála and to which the city council has lodged a four-page objection. Where is the joined-up thinking? What is the future for Cork if one local authority is objecting to an application for planning permission in another local authority area? This development of more than 600 units is badly needed in that area and has been put forward for strategic funding for social housing by the Government, yet the local authorities are playing petty politics, which is inappropriate. Local authorities in Cork need to work together rather than object to each other's proposals. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has no issue with the development but the city council is objecting to its planning permission. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, must get involved in such issues in Cork and ensure he knocks heads together in order to avoid situations such as this, where one local authority is objecting to planning permission in another local authority area. Action is required. In many ways, it is important that the Minister should intervene so that something can be sorted out in this scenario.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I wish to be associated with the remarks made by other Senators in complimenting the local communities, the fire service , council workers and volunteers who played a great role in responding to the major crisis during last week's storm. I wish to discuss a new line of crime that came to light as a result of the storm and was highlighted on radio this morning, namely, the large-scale theft of home heating oil. One lady who spoke on radio told of how, after running out of fuel, she had ordered more from her supplier. He arrived at 2.30 p.m. with 700 litres which cost her €500. Her plumber arrived at 4.30 p.m. to bleed the heating system to get her back up and running, but the tank was dry. There was a two-hour window. It is said people are following fuel lorries around. It is a major problem. I highlight a good initiative being taken for the first time this year by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, under which people can claim fuel allowance in two lump sum payments, with a view to giving them some buying power when buying home heating oil in bulk, which is more economical than buying it weekly. Owing to bulk buying, however, they are vulnerable to thugs. When the Department makes lump sum payments, it is important that it inform its clientele of the risks involved. The oil tank of the woman in question was located in a remote area well hidden behind her house, but someone only needs to click on Google Maps to be able to see into everyone's backyard and find out where the oil tank is located. The perpetrators have vans with pumps and long hoses. The vans which might be marked can be parked 50 yd. up the road. A houseowner could even be talking to the perpetrators in the van while oil is being sucked out of the tank through a long hose. In the case in question, the tank would have been empty had the perpetrators arrived two hours earlier and they knew exactly when to take it. They had followed the lorry and knew who was receiving a delivery that day. We need to get the message out that people need to be conscious of this issue. Being able to receive fuel allowance in two equal payments during the year in order that people can buy kerosene is a great initiative, but it has led to people being made vulnerable.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">As a fellow sports fan, the Leader will join me in being deeply concerned and somewhat dismayed and confused, if not offended, by the remarks of the Northern Ireland soccer manager, Mr. Michael O'Neill, over the course of the weekend. In an interview which was published online, subsequently removed and republished in a toned down form he accused the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, of employing sectarian tactics and poaching players from the North. It causes me deep concern, in the first instance, because it pertains to issues related to equality of citizenship, identity and our right as fellow citizens to be full and equal participants in the life of Ireland. It is for the FAI to speak for itself and I would not presume to do so, but I imagine that one of its first comments will be that many of the players from the North who will ultimately end up playing for the FAI do the approaching in the first instance as opposed to it poaching them. I do not understand the rationale behind it and do not know how to take it, as sport should not be brought into the political domain. Focusing solely on the issues of identity and citizenship is concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> We must ensure we stand and act as guardians of the right of citizens in the North to be full and equal participants in the life of Ireland, including playing for the national soccer side unhindered and without the incessant and relentless abuse that, for example, has been levelled at people from the city of Derry who have dared to pull on the green jersey and do what I contest is an exceptional job for Ireland on the field. It is not up to Mr. O'Neill or anyone in the FAI to impose a perceived citizenship on anyone else. An easy solution would be something for which we have called in this Chamber, namely, the creation of an all-Ireland soccer team in line with what happens in boxing, rugby, hockey, cricket and every other sport. Another way around it would be for the FAI to engage with young people in the North from an early age in order that these problems and issues will not present in the later stages of people's careers. In many instances, it is not young people's fault that they have to go through the Irish Football Association's structures in the North. That is the system in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Let us talk about how to resolve this issue and open up participation in FAI sports to citizens across the country. The reality is that for very many young people in the North, going to play at Windsor Park under the defunct flag of the old unionist regime and having to stand and observe "God Save the Queen" as an anthem is a cold house. They do not want to do it. Many others have an affinity with it. Fair play and good luck to them and more power to their elbow, but we must collectively acknowledge that a growing number of people do not have that affinity and should not be forced to go through these structures. When such a prominent and eminent sports figure like Mr. O'Neill presumes to say people playing for Ireland is somehow sectarian, as guardians of Irish citizenship, we must call it out for what it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I raise an issue that has been discussed by many Senators this morning, last week's difficult and extreme weather conditions and their impact on the retail sector. The weather conditions carried a significant cost for the industry in lost sales, employee wages and clean-up costs. It amounted to hundreds of millions of euro and retailers have been left to pick up the pieces, as was evident when listening to Ms Lorraine Higgins of Retail Excellence Ireland on radio this week. She outlined the advertising costs retailers would incur to eke out their losses from last week. I have an issue with the non-existence of cash in post offices, which exacerbated retailers' losses during the extreme weather event. It was reported that post offices in counties Dublin, Louth and Offaly and some in the midlands had been emptied of cash as social welfare recipients queued to collect payments. This posed an additional challenge to retailers who were already facing extreme weather conditions and lost opening times.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Given that no similar problems surfaced at ATMs and banks, did the Government properly plan for the doubling of the fuel allowance? Did it ensure that An Post had enough cash reserves and a satisfactory plan in place? Were cash logistics de-risked to ensure that such threats to cash supply would not happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> We are all aware that this matter had an impact on social welfare payments because many people did not receive what they were told were their entitlements. Unfortunately, the situation will continue this week and it will continue to have impact on retailers for the coming weeks. We need to debate this issue and ensure that small independent shops in towns do not suffer in this way again. I urge consumers to continue to support their local shops which are key stakeholders in their communities. Only for local shops in many areas, people would have been left high and dry. </p>

          <p eId="para_145">Thomas Francis Meagher not only ran for parliament, unsuccessfully, for Westminster in 1848, he was a leader in the rebellion in Ireland of 1848 for which he was put on trial for high treason. He was the last man in Ireland to be sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered. Prior to sentencing the judge asked him if he had anything to say, to which he replied: "Well your honour, I give you my word as a gentleman that if you do not sentence me to death, I will try again." The judge obliged and sentenced him to death but the sentence was commuted to transportation for life to Australia. He escaped from Van Diemen's Land and travelled to America where he joined the 69th regiment of the Union Army in the American Civil War and went on to become the Governor of Montana. As befits a man who had an extraordinary life, he had an extraordinary death. One evening he was on a paddle steamboat on the Missouri River but the following day he was gone never to be seen again. He was only 43 years of age when he died.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> It is important to note that Thomas Francis Meagher gave us the flag and his aspirations for the flag. He said: "I trust that beneath its folds the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped, in generous and heroic brotherhood." His message is as true today as it was 170 years ago. I ask the Leader to make a few comments on this historic occasion. Let us bear in mind that this House formally adopted, for the first time ever, protocols for the national flag.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I thank the 17 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business today. I wish first to recognise, as Senators Coffey and Mark Daly rightly said in their contributions, the importance of the flag and what it symbolises. I commend Thomas Francis Meagher on giving us the Tricolour. As Senator Coffey has said, we should reflect on what the Tricolour represents. It is important that we remember Thomas Francis Meagher on this day and, equally, as Senator Coffey has said, the role played by John Redmond. As the country celebrates a decade of commemorations, it is important that we recognise all parts of this country, all sides, all denominations, all people, all religions, all colours and all races. We may be an island nation but we are at the heart of Europe and not on its edge, which gives us enormous credibility across the world. Last week, President Trump designated March the Irish-American month in the United States. Next week, An Taoiseach will travel across America and will represent all of us. It is important that we stand strong as a nation and remember the sacrifices and heroism of so many people who got this country to this point. Like Senators Coffey and Mark Daly, I urge people to remember what Thomas Francis Meagher did today so many years ago and I wish Senator Coffey well when he attends the commemorative events in Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I join Senators Swanick and Ardagh in welcoming the St. Brigid's home school liaison team from the Coombe area who do Trojan work in this city. I wish to highlight the importance of home school liaison and the significant role that it plays not just in the Coombe area but across the county. The scheme is a vital and important part of the education system. I thank Senator Ardagh for welcoming the delegation to the House today. </p>
          <p eId="para_156"> In terms of the contributions made during the Order of Business, I started on a positive note and I am reluctant to commence a discordant attack on Senator Ardagh. However, it is ironic that Senator Ardagh unfortunately lamented the fact that water is a challenging issue in the capital city and in some parts of the country when her party played absolute populism with Irish Water. Her party played Molly Bawn with the Irish people in 2016-----</p>

I join Senator Ardagh in asking Irish Water to communicate effectively and efficiently with the people affected by the current water crisis. There is a need to recognise the fact that there are water leakages. There is an issue with the water supply in the reservoir but, unfortunately, we cannot do anything about it this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> We had a 10% increase in the demand for water from Friday to Sunday in the greater Dublin area.

          <p eId="para_180">I join Senator Ardagh in her appeal for people to donate blood. Yesterday, the Minister for Health appealed to people to donate blood and made a very strong statement on the matter. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has requested people to donate. I ask Members of the House to encourage people to donate blood through social media and other means. Senator Ardagh is 100% correct when she said people require blood for a variety of different reasons. It is imperative that we, through this Chamber and our own offices, appeal to people to donate blood. As much as one in four people will require a blood transfusion at some stage of their lives. As Senator Ardagh has said, many people need blood donations now because the blood supply has been severely depleted due to the storm. It is important that blood donors, and those who would like to become blood donors, donate now. I urge people to visit donation clinics. There is information available on this matter. It is important that Senators support the call to donate blood, and I join Senator Ardagh in doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">On the CAP review, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, did a great job in securing a very good deal for Ireland under the CAP review. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Creed, and Commissioner Hogan will always fight for the Irish farmer and put Ireland at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> With regard to the issue of Storm Emma, the Department and Teagasc are working with the farming organisations to ensure that farmers have access to information, advice, support and help, whether with fodder or payments. The Minister has committed that his Department will monitor and work to ensure that any difficulties which emerge will be addressed. Information is available from a variety of sources. It is important, as Senators Lombard, Daly and Davitt referred to, that farmers in rural Ireland during Storm Emma were at the forefront in helping people. We should thank them most sincerely. There are huge issues for farmers with regard to collapsed sheds, farming, fodder, being able to get back to the land and getting cattle out of houses and onto the land. That will take time. The Minister is vigilant and aware of that and will work to ensure that we do the best for Irish farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I congratulate Senator Bacik on the role she plays with others in the House, including Senators Noone, Higgins, Conway-Walsh and Ardagh, in Vótáil 100. I welcome the events this week in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is important that we recognise the movement we have made and the journey we have to go on. I commend Senator Bacik on her leadership on the issue and congratulate her on her recruitment, poaching or otherwise of Senator Norris to the Technical Group.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_207">Goodwill and friendship. I look forward to seeing the transfers in the Seanad Trinity panel, if there is one on the next occasion. I welcome that decision. Like Senators Noone, Higgins, Gavan and Norris, I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court today relating to the issue of the rights of the unborn in our Constitution. It is significant that the seven judges agreed. Senator Norris's comments are well-made. There is much information from Senator Norris that we can listen to, reflect on and act upon. I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said we will have that debate as part of the Bill. I assure Senator Gavan that, as Leader of the House, I will not delay passage of the Bill. There may well be a very tight timeline to have the Bill passed. At the same time, as Senator Gavan will appreciate, given that we sat on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, there is a need to allow others who have not participated to have their voice heard as part of that debate, which may present a different viewpoint from ours. That will be a tricky balancing act and may require creativity by group leaders of different groups in the House to ensure that we have ample time to debate the Bill rather than rushing it through. I am sure we can work together on that. The point the Senator makes is that we should not, as a House, be seen to be an impediment or a delay. I entirely agree with the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I have not seen Senator Bacik's motion yet, but as part of the statements on foreign affairs today, perhaps the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade might have a conversation with the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> In response to Senator Higgins, I have not had a ruling on the European Court of Justice investor-state dispute settlement system come across my desk just yet. We will have a debate with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade today. I know it is not necessarily linked to that but it could be part of it. We will try to have the debate in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Seanad reform is a matter beyond the remit of my office. It is up to the Taoiseach to decide the composition and chair of the committee. Work on that is under way. As with the eighth amendment, there will be diverging views on the reform of Seanad Éireann. Perhaps the two shall meet. Senator Higgins has one view. Others have a different view. We must try to achieve a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I covered Senator Coffey's contribution with regard to Vótáil 100 and Irish Water. I acknowledge the symposium that took place yesterday for John Redmond.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Senator Swanick has been a champion of and advocate for those who are lonely. He has been so again this morning. I echo the words of Seán Moynihan that it is not just about last week but an ongoing issue for some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I agree with Senator Craughwell about pay restoration. There is a need to see accelerated pay restoration for teachers. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has accelerated the pace of recruitment and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Senator Noone, who excellently chaired the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, contributed regarding the eighth amendment. We need to see an informed debate not just in this House but throughout the country, and not just on people's opinions but on fact rather than fiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I was not aware of the supplementary examination fee at Trinity College Dublin but I agree with Senator Gavan that we should not be putting in place an impediment or barrier to people participating in higher education or further education. While I am not aware of the situation in Trinity College Dublin, as an educator myself and having gone to college, to increase the fee to the level the Senator speaks about, €450, for those students who have to do repeat examinations does not make good sense. Even if it is done for economic reasons, it puts a hardship on people who are struggling already. There is mental pressure, and the physical act of having to come back and repeat examinations is not a very happy one. I hope that Trinity College Dublin will review that situation. I would not agree with it personally.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I congratulate Senator Dolan on raising the issue of brain awareness. This week is brain awareness week. I congratulate the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which is hosting a conference this weekend. It is a very important issue. I chaired the Joint Committee on Health and we had a number of significant debates on that. I echo the Senator's point that further work needs to be done on the issue of brain awareness and neurology as an entity in our health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Senator Lombard raised the issue of new local government arrangements in Cork. He referred to a particular case, and while I will not get into that, there is a need for joined-up thinking by both authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I join Senator Paul Daly in condemning the theft of oil from numerous homes throughout the country. He is right that there is an issue with thugs and thieves coming on to people's property to steal fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">There needs to be away around that to ensure people are protected. We cannot have a garda at every corner of every townland or other part of rural Ireland but the Senator is right. Perhaps the Department of Employment and Social Protection and others should have a mechanism where we can ensure we raise awareness of this problem through the community alert programme or through the Department of Justice and Law Reform to alert people to this issue. Such theft is disappointing and upsetting for people. The case the Senator cited of the person who had got a fill of oil at 2.30 p.m. and it was gone by 4 p.m. is disgraceful. There is more work to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I will not get into a row with Senator Ó Domhnaill about the issue he raised. Michael O'Neill was being protective of his own players rather than having players lost to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI. The FAI has remained silent on it. Michael O'Neill is a Catholic. He was referring to Catholic players being signed up for the Republic. I do not believe he was being mischievous other than looking out for his own players. We are all involved in sport and we must protect our own, but I would certainly hope he was not being sectarian. I will not get into a row on it but it is important that we allow for players to choose whichever side they want to play for. </p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The irony of Senator Davitt's contribution is that some of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil were criticising the fact that we did not announce the double week for the social protection fuel allowance earlier. The logistics-----</p>

          <p eId="para_237">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh agus go raibh maith agat freisin fá choinne an chuiridh go dtí an Seanad inniu. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teach seo as an gcuireadh a thug sé dom labhairt leis le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge agus ar ndóigh le linn Bhliain na Gaeilge 2018. </p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Tá an Rialtas seo dírithe ar theacht leis an tiomantas dár gcultúr agus dár dteanga atá le feiceáil i mórán de na heagraíochtaí díograiseacha atá ar fud an Stáit, taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí. Chuige sin, cuireadh maoiniú breise de €2.5 milliún ar fáil don Ghaeilge, don Ghaeltacht agus do na hoileáin in 2018. San áireamh sa bhuiséad don bhliain seo tá €1.4 milliún breise chun tacú leis an phróiseas pleanála teanga faoin straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, cuireadh €400,000 de mhaoiniú breise ar fáil d’Údarás na Gaeltachta chun infheistiú ina chláir caipitil agus chun tacaíocht do chomharchumainn agus d’eagraiochtaí forbartha pobail na Gaeltachta a mhéadú, rud a fhágann go bhfuil an maoiniú caipitil don údarás méadaithe go €7 milliún, cuireadh €450,000 ar fáil do Bhliain na Gaeilge 2018, agus rinneadh leithdháileadh breise de €687,000 ar scéimeanna tacaíochta teanga na Roinne lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Tá €2.65 milliún á chur ar fáil faoi bhuiséad 2018 do chur i bhfeidhm an phróiseas pleanála teanga i mbliana. Is ionann sin agus ardú €1.8 milliún thar an allúntas a bhí ar fáil don phróiseas anuraidh. Ina theannta sin, tá ardú ar an gcistíocht atá ar fáil do na gnáthchláir reatha ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a bhfuil dlúthbhaint acu chomh maith le cur i bhfeidhm an straitéis 20 bliain. Leis an allúntas méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht trí chéiIe, tá ag éirí le mo Roinn tacú tuilleadh le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus an phróiseas pleanála teanga mar a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeltacht, na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta agus na líonraí Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Tuigfidh na Seanadóirí gur ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna a thiteann an fhreagracht an polasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022 a chur i bhfeidhm. D’fhéadfaí a rá gur aisfhreagra suntasach is ea an polasaí seo ar a bhfuil ráite agus molta sa straitéis 20 bliain mar a bhaineann sé le cúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht. Mar léiriú breise ar dháiríreacht leanúnach an Rialtais seo chun cúram a dhéanamh do chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, is díol suntais é go bhfuil aonad polasaí oideachais Gaeltachta faoi leith bunaithe cheana féin ag mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire, an Teachta Bruton, chun cur i bhfeidhm an pholasaí a bhrú chun cinn. Léirionn sé seo uile go bhfuil céim thábhachtach eile chun cinn glactha ag an Rialtas ar son na Gaeilge agus cur i bhfeidhm córasach na straitéise.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Tá sárobair ar bun ag na heagraíochtaí taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, ag obair go díograiseach - sa Deisceart, sa Tuaisceart agus go hidirnáisiúnta - chun úsáid na teanga a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt ar fud na tíre, agus is deas liom gur tugadh aitheantas dóibh sa bhuiséad. Tá ceannáras nua anois ag Foras na Gaeilge, agus é anois lonnaithe ar Shráid Amiens i dtuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath. Guím gach rath orthu san ionad úr seo. Bíonn Foras na Gaeilge ag gníomhú ar bhonn leanúnach i gcomhréir leis an sé cheanneagraíocht atá faoina chúram, is iad sin Gaeloideachas teoranta, Gael Linn, Glór na nGael, Oireachtas na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus Cumann na bhFiann. Tá Foras na Gaeilge freagrach as oibriú le pobail i mbailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta, de réir mar is cuí, agus i líonraí Gaeilge chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú sna ceantair sin. Cuidionn sé le pobal na Gaeilge agus lucht spéise na Gaeilge ar fud an domhain trí bhéim a chur ar sheirbhísí agus áiseanna ar líne.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Cuireann Foras na Gaeilge maoiniú ar fáil do réimse leathan tionscadal trí scéimeanna éagsúla a chuidíonn leis an aos óg. Tá an scéim Gaelbhratach dírithe ar scoileanna agus á fheidhmiú i 70 scoil. Tá deiseanna foghlama á gcur ar fáil chomh maith trí scéim na gcampa samhraidh. Tá scéimeanna agus tionscadail ar fáil ón bhforas chun úsáid na teanga sna healaíona, sna meáin agus sna hilmheáin a chur chun cinn, lena n-áiritear scéim na gcomplachtaí drámaíochta, scéim na bhféilte, scéim na foilsitheoireachta agus scéim na dtionscadal litríochta. Tuigtear an ról an-tábhachtach atá ag gnólachtaí maidir le forbairt agus spreagadh na Gaeilge, go háirithe sna limistéir pleanála teanga. Cuirtear tacaíocht ar fáil ón bhforas d'fhorbairt na Gaeilge san earnáil gnó tríd an bhfeachtas feasachta Gnó Means Business agus trí scéimeanna ar nós scéim na gcomharthaí dátheangacha.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Is cuid luachmhar dár n-oidhreacht logainmneacha na tíre. Tá forbairt leanúnach á déanamh ar an suíomh <i>logainm.ie</i> ag an mbrainse logainmneacha, ar cuid de mo Roinn é, i gcomhar le Fiontar agus scoil na Gaeilge in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus le tacaíocht airgid ón Rialtas. Sa bhliain 2017, mar shampla, scrúdaigh agus shocraigh an brainse na leaganacha Gaeilge de 400 logainm i gContae Chill Mhantáin, agus de 200 logainm i gContae Chiarraí. I gcaitheamh na bliana fosta, cuireadh na leaganacha Gaeilge do 1,500 logainm i gContae Laoise os comhair an Choiste Logainmneacha le hiniúchadh. Is coiste Stáit neamhspleách é an Coiste Logainmneacha, ceaptha ag an Aire Stáit ar a bhfuil freagracht as an Ghaeltacht, agus a oibríonn ar bhonn deonach. Tá moladh mór ag dul do bhaill an choiste sin as a gcuid oibre. Tá an-éileamh ar an suíomh <i>logainm.ie</i>. I gcaitheamh na míosa seo caite, mar shampla, thug 26,000 cuairteoir uathúil cuairt ar an suíomh agus sa bhliain 2016, tháinig fiosrúcháin tríd an suíomh Idirlín céanna faoi thart ar 1,000 logainm.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Mar atá ráite go minic roimhe seo, ní miste dom a threisiú arís gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na hacmhainní nádurtha is luachmhaire atá againn. Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint le pobal labhartha láidir Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chothú chun saibhreas oidhreachta na teanga a choinneáil beo agus a thabhairt slán don chéad ghlúin eile. Cé go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta gach a dhéanamh laistigh dá chumhacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomha ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chothú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, cuma cén leibhéal cumais atá acu inti. Tá sé riachtanach go leanfar ag baint leas as an teanga mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus go gcuirfear an teanga chun cinn ar bhonn níos forleithne taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liomsa tiomantas agus dáiríreacht an Rialtais i leith chur i bhfeidhm an straitéis 20 bliain a threisiú uair amháin eile anseo inniu. Táim sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh maidir le raon leathan gníomhaíochtaí faoin straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm de réir a chéile. Is maith liom an seans inniu labhairt agus comhrá a dhéanamh faoi Bhliain na Gaeilge agus Seachtain na Gaeilge. Dá mbeadh aon smaointe ag teacht aníos, beidh mé sásta oibriú leis na Seanadóirí orthu. Gabhaim aitheantas chuig an seachtar ó Ghaillimh atá ina suí anseo, Seanadóir Ó Céidigh ina measc, faoi choinne an chláir atá leagtha amach don choicís seo chugainn maidir leis an Ghaeilge a spreagadh sa Seanad. Beidh mé sásta teacht ar ais. Fuair mé teachtaireacht an tSeanadóra aréir.</p>

          <from>Senator Catherine Ardagh<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_246">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit agus cuirim fáilte go dtí an Seanad roimhe arís. Tá rath mór tagtha ar Sheachtain na Gaeilge ón am agus a raibh mé i mo ghasúr. Caithfimid iarracht a dhéanamh sa Seanad agus i dTeach Laighean an tseachtain a choimeád mar sheachtain gur fiú í a chéiliúradh. Ba chóir dúinn go léir iarracht níos mó a dhéanamh teagmháil a dhéanamh lena chéile as Gaeilge. Tá sé ar cheann de chuspóirí Fhianna Fáil ó thráth a bhunaithe an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine agus cearta na ndaoine a labhraíonn an teanga a chosaint. Tá an teanga náisiúnta ar cheann de sheoda cultúrtha na tíre seo agus ní féidir cur síos ar an tábhacht chinniúnach atá léi dá réir. Nuair atá 100 bliain caite ó tharla Éirí Amach na Cásca, is ríghéar an gá borradh agus brí a chur an athuair sna hiarrachtaí úsáid na Gaeilge a bhuanú agus a fhorbairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Seasann Fianna Fáil go daingean leis an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, a thug an páirtí chun cinn agus é i rialtas, agus lena chur i bhfeidhm. Thug an páirtí Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 isteach chomh maith. Bhí Fianna Fáil i mbun feachtais ar son maoiniú breise don Ghaeilge agus cuirimid fáilte roimh an €2.5 milliún de mhaoiniú breisie le haghaidh an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn in 2018. Is díol trua nach raibh aon dhúthracht maidir leis an teanga, nó le cearta teanga a chosaint, ag rith dáiríre leis an Rialtas roimhe seo, a bhí faoi cheannas Fhine Gael. Ní mór ceannródaíocht leanúnach agua cistíocht ionas go mbeadh rath ar an straitéis 20 bliain a thabhairt i bhfeidhm. Anuas air sin, leagadh amach mar ghealltanas i gclár an Rialtais sa bhliain 2011 go ndéanfaí smaoineamh ar deireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge éigeantach san ardteistiméireacht. Is léiriú eile é sin ar mheon Fhine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I manifesto Fhianna Fáil le haghaidh olltoghchán na bliana 2016, rinne an páirtí feachtasaíocht ar son na mbearta seo a leanas.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Dúirt muid gur cheart go mbeadh Aire sinsearach ann a bheadh an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge mar phríomhchúraimí air nó uirthi, gur cheart coiste Oireachtais a chur ar bun a bheadh freagrach as gnóthaí na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge, gur cheart go dtabharfaí faoi na deacrachtaí cistíochta a bhí ag Foras na Gaeilge agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta trí acmhainní breise a chur ar fáil dóibh, agus gur cheart go gcinnteofar go mbeadh an Ghaeilge i gcónaí mar chroíchuid den churaclam le haghaidh an teastas sóisearach agus an ardteistiméireacht. Cé nach bhfuil Fianna Fáil sa Rialtas, táimid agus beimid ag gníomhú go tairbheach sa Fhreasúra ag féachaint leis na haidhmeanna polasaí sin a bhaint amach. Dírítear ar an nGaeilge faoi thrí chinn de théamaí i gclár an Rialtais na bliana 2016: an straitéis 20 bliain, cúrsaí teanga agus eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht, agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga iomlán. Caithfidh mé a rá go gcoinneoidh Fianna Fáil an Rialtas dílis do na gealltanais dá réir sin.</p>

Caithfidh mé buíochas ó chroí a ghabháil leis agus lena fhoireann i dtaobh an dáiríreacht atá aige ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Bhí beagán Gaeilge aige, ach d'fhoghlaim sé níos mó.

          <p eId="para_255">Tá sé, agus coinnigh suas é. Ba mhaith liom achainí a chur ar chuile dhuine sa Seanad. B'fhéidir go rachaimid síos go dtí Conradh na Gaeilge an tseachtain seo chugainn leis na fáinní seo a cheannach agus go n-úsáidfimid iad ina dhiaidh sin. Ní gá go mbeadh togha na Gaeilge acu siúd a gcaitheann iad. Tá fáinne óir, fáinne airgid agus mar sin de ann. Ní chosnaíonn siad ach cúpla euro. B'fhéidir go léireodh sé sin go bhfuilimid níos dáiríre faoin nGaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Molaim an tAire Stáit. Tá sé lándáiríre faoin nGaeilge. De réir mar a thuigim, beidh sé ar phainéal na Dúnaibh le haghaidh Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta agus ag imirt corner back. Níor mhaith liom bheith i mo corner forward agus an tAire Stáit i mo mharcáil más rud é go bhfuil sé sa pheil mar atá sé sa pholaitíocht. Go bhfóire Dia orainn, ní bheadh seans agam. B'fhéidir go mbeidh mé ag an gcomórtas ag breathnú ar an Aire Stáit agus ag féachaint cén sórt peileadóir é.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Ba mhaith liom bheith níos dáiríre faoi chúpla rud ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ar nós mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Ardagh, cuirim fáilte roimh an infheistíocht thábhachtach de €2.5 milliún atá déanta. Léiríonn sé sin go bhfuil dáiríreacht éigin ann ó thaobh an Rialtais de maidir le forbairt na Gaeilge. Bíonn imní orm ag an am seo den bhliain, agus Seachtain na Gaeilge ar siúl agus muid ag teacht suas le Lá Fhéile Pádraig, nuair atáimid ag caint ar an nGaeilge. Ní gá dom tuilleadh a rá ach go gcuireann sé i gcuimhne dom an fógra, "a pet is not just for Christmas", a bhíonn ar an teilifís ag teacht suas go dtí an Nollaig gach bliain. Táimid uilig dáiríre faoin nGaeilge. Táimid an-bhródúil as an teanga agus as dreamanna ar nós Chumann Lúthchleas Gael. Nuair a bheidh muintir na hÉireann ag imirt rugbaí ag an deireadh seachtaine, agus geansaithe na hÉireann orthu, beimid an-bhródúil astu freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Seasann muid mar chuid den Eoraip agus mar chuid den domhan mór. Is féidir linn ár bhfóin phóca á úsáid chun ceangal a dhéanamh le chuile dhuine. Tá sé tábhachtach sa chomhthéacs sin go seasaimid suas ar son who we are. Dúirt mé cheana le mo chara, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, atá tar éis an Teach a fhágáil - tá sé an-dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go breá leis agus é ag obair anois le TG4 - go bhfuil motto beag scríofa agam ar whiteboard sa bhaile: "success is not what you have; success is who you are". Who we are as Irish people is the Irish language and culture. Tá na nithe seo an-tábhachtach agus táimid an-bhródúil astu. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbrúfaimid ar aghaidh mar ionadaithe pobail na tíre seo agus go mbeimid mar cheannródaithe agus leaders in this area. Glacaim leis go n-aontaíonn an tAire Stáit go bhfuil go leor eile le déanamh go fóill.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud beag fánach eile a lua. Níl siad fánach, ar bhealach. Is fiú níos mó infheistíochta a dhéanamh sna coláistí Gaeilge. Nuair a thagann go leor scoláirí as gach cuid den tír chucu, feiceann siad na Gaeltachtaí agus céard atá ar siúl iontu don chéad uair. Nuair a bhí mé ag caint le beirt dhaoine i dTeach Laighean ar maidin, dúirt siad liom gur thuig siad an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht don chéad uair nuair a bhí siad ag freastal ar choláistí Gaeilge i nDún na nGall agus i gConamara. Nuair a bhí mé in Árainn, ar Inis Oírr, an tseachtain seo caite, dúradh liom go bhfuil scoláirí as an nGalltacht ag freastal ar scoileanna meánscoile, ach go háirithe, agus bunscoile sa Ghaeltacht. Tá sé seo ag tarlú sa Rinn, mar shampla. Tagann daoine ó Bhaile Átha Cliath chun freastal ar na meánscoileanna sna Gaeltachtaí sin agus an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Bíonn na daoine seo fite fuaite leis an bpobal áitiúil. Tá mé ag iarraidh go gceanglófar le chéile pobal na Galltachta agus pobal na Gaeltachta. Is mar a chéile muid - we are two sides of the one coin.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de. Níl aon mhaith plean Gaeilge a bheith againn don Ghaeltacht muna bhfuil daoine in ann poist a fháil sa Ghaeltacht. Tá mise in ann cónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Tá fadhbanna móra le cúrsaí pleanála agus cúrsaí taistil sa Ghaeltacht. Caithfear joined-up thinking ó na Ranna éagsúla a bheith ann. Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais, tá go leor scoileanna a bhí le dúnadh. Níl a fhios agam cén chaoi ina bhfuil siad anois. Molaim go láidir an plean an-mhaith atá ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de. Molaim go láidir Foras na Gaeilge freisin, ach tá fadhb mhór ag an bhforas, mar is eol don Aire Stáit. Mar gheall nach bhfuil Rialtas ag teacht le chéile i dTuaisceart Éireann, níl an tacaíocht airgid gur chóir go mbeadh ag an bhforas ag dul chuige. Tá srianta móra ar Fhoras na Gaeilge mar gheall ar sin. Faigheann Údarás na Gaeltachta idir 50% agus 60% den mhéid airgid a fhaigheann IDA Ireland agus Fiontraíocht Éireann chun poist a chruthú. Nílim, agus níl éinne eile anseo, ag iarraidh go mbeadh dímheas á dhéanamh ar dhaoine díreach má labhraíonn siad an Ghaeilge. Tuigim nach bhfuil sé sin ag teastáil ón Aire Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Aire Stáit gur labhair sé faoin ócáid speisialta a bheidh againn ar an 21 Márta seo chugainn. Tá tacaíocht an tSeanaid agus tacaíocht an Aire Stáit faighte agam don lá speisialta sin. Tá sé i gceist go dtiocfaimid uilig le chéile sa Seanad chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Beidh aoichainteoir ag teacht isteach. Tá roinnt moltaí agam don Aire Stáit ó thaobh polasaithe an Rialtais ag dul ar aghaidh. Ba bhreá liom casadh leis roimh ré agus labhairt leis faoi na moltaí sin. Beidh mé ag lorg tacaíocht na Seanadóirí ar fad, le cúnamh Dé, ionas go mbeimid le chéile ar aon lá amháin. Is rud deimhneach, seachas rud polaitiúil, é seo. Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann bunábhar phlean Sheanad Éireann ó thaobh fhorbairt na Gaeilge de a aontú le tacaíocht an Aire Stáit.</p>

          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_262">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá sé i gcónaí fíor-álainn Gaeilge Thír Chonaill a chluinstin sa Teach seo. Deireann a lán daoine gurb í an Ghaeilge is binne nó is deise in Éirinn, ach is doiléir an fíor é sin i ndiaidh óráid an tSeanadóra Uí Chéidigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> Cosúil leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh, a luaigh an fáinne óir, caithim an fáinne sin beagnach gach lá taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Teach seo. Mar a luaigh an Seanadóir agus cainteoirí eile, tá ról lárnach ag an teanga inár saol. Ar mo chéad lá sa Teach seo agus ar mo chéad lá i Halla na Cathrach i mBéal Feirste, chaith mé sean-heirloom ársa atá againn sa chlann. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé ró-luachmhar ó thaobh airgid de, ach léiríonn sé an stair, an saibhreas agus an oidhreacht a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge. Sna 1940í, bhí mo sheanathair, Séamus Mac an Bheatha, imtheorannaithe ar an long phríosúin <i>Al Rawdah</i>. He was interned on the <i>Al Rawdah</i>. Tháinig na cimí le chéile chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a mhúineadh dá chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Nuair a bhain siad leibhéal proifisiúnta amach, agus iad imtheorannaithe, rinne siad fáinní as na píopaí copair a bhí ar an long. Ní raibh ór ar bith acu ar an <i>Al Rawdah</i> na laethanta sin. Nuair a tháinig siad amach agus scaoileadh saor iad, chuaigh siad uilig go dtí seódóir agus chuir siad an copar seo in ór. Sin rud a chaithim. B'fhéidir go gcaithfidh mé an fáinne sin an tseachtain seo chugainn agus ar an lá atá an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh ag moladh dúinn chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Déarfaidh mé cúpla rud níos dáiríre agus an tAire Stáit linn. Dar ndóigh, cuirim fáilte roimh Bhliain na Gaeilge mar chreidim go mór i luach agus i dtábhacht ár dteanga náisiúnta. Is mór an trua é nár thug an Rialtas maoiniú sa bhreis leis an bhliain speisialta seo a chomóradh. Tháinig an mhaoiniú ó Fhoras na Gaeilge agus bhí ar an bhforas airgead a bhaint ó thionscadail eile dá bharr sin. Ar an drochuair, léiríonn sé seo an cur chuige atá ag an Rialtas ó thaobh na Gaeilge de: béalghrá agus cur i gcéill cuid mhaith den am. Bíonn an Rialtas ag maíomh go bhfuil an-chuid á déanamh aige ach ag an am céanna bíonn sé ag gearradh siar ar sheirbhísí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge. Cuir i gcás an bád farantóireachta a bhfuaireamar ar Thoraigh: seanbhád míchuí agus cuma caite air le freastal ar phobal beo Gaeltachta. Seo siombal eile oiriúnach don tslí ina mbíonn an Rialtas ag déileáil le riachtanais mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Is maith an rud é an Ghaeilge agus na tréan-iarrachtaí atá an-chuid daoine ag déanamh a mholadh. Ní dóigh liom féin, áfach, go dtuigeann roinnt de bhaill an Rialtas an phráinn atá i gceist leis an Ghaeilge agus, go háirithe, leis an Ghaeltacht. Muna bhfuilimid ionraic faoin fhadhb, ní bheidh mé in ann dul i ngleic léithi. Aithním agus deirim anseo go creidim go dian go bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag déanamh a fhíordhíchill chun dul i ngleic ar a chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Creidim go bhfuil ardmholadh tuillte ag Conradh na Gaeilge agus, b'fhéidir níos tábhachtaí arís, ag na grúpaí agus eagraíochtaí uilig atá ag glacadh páirte i Seachtain na Gaeilge agus i mBliain na Gaeilge. Tá siad ag iarraidh a bheith gníomhach agus bríomhar ó thaobh úsáid agus feiceálacht na Gaeilge ar fud fad na tíre. Tá sé tábhachtach a rá gur imeachtaí uileÉireann agus domhanda iad Seachtain na Gaeilge agus Bliain na Gaeilge. Mar gheall ar na meáin shóisialta, chímid Pop-up Gaeltachtaí ar fud na cruinne. Tá siad ann ó Hong Cong go Nua Eabhrac go Béal Feirste go Luimneach. Tá siad in achan áit, agus rudaí thar a bheith dearfach agus maith iad.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Aontaím leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh agus tuigim an méid a bhí sé ag rá maidir leis na srianta atá ar Fhoras na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh. B'fhéidir ceann de na srianta is mó atá curtha ar an fhoras ó Thuaidh ná go bhfaigheann sé i bhfad níos lú airgid ná mar a fhaigheann sé ó Dheas. An srian is mó atá orainn ar fad sna Sé Chontae ná nach bhfuil reachtaíocht fiúntach aonarach i bhfoirm Acht Gaeilge againn. Níl sé sin curtha i bhfeidhm. Ba mhaith liom mo mholadh a thabhairt don Rialtas ó thaobh an tseasaimh a bhí aige maidir leis an Acht. Aontaíonn an Rialtas gur cheart go mbeadh Acht féin-seasmhach atá bunaithe ar chearta curtha i bhfeidhm ó Thuaidh. Bhí sé deas focail an Aire Stáit i dtaobh an t-ábhar sin a chluinsint arís inniu.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Tá gá go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla i bhfeidhm ionas go mbeadh an Stát in ann freastal ar dhualgais mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht labhartha na Gaeilge chomh maith. Is gá go mbunófar cultúrlann i mBaile Átha Cliath. Tá sé dochreidte nach bhfuil ceann againn cheana féin, áit do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge inár bpríomhchathair.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Bhí an Comhchoiste um Feidhmiú Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta ar cuairt thart ar cheathrú Gaeltachta Bhéal Feirste ar na mallaibh agus baineadh geit as roinnt mhaith dá bhaill. Chuir sé iontas orthu an Ghaeilge a fheiceáil chomh beo bríomhar i gcomhthéacs uirbeach i gcroílar iarthar Bhéal Feirste. Is é atá i gceist leis an chultúrlann na tionscadal a bhfuil tacaíocht aige ón chomhairle cathrach i mBéal Feirste. Scríobh mé chuig an Aire Stáit ar na mallaibh chun cuireadh a thabhairt dó teacht ar cuairt é féin le hamharc ar an cheathrú Gaeltachta agus b'fhéidir cúpla ceacht a fhoghlaim agus an deachleachtas a fheiceáil curtha i bhfeidhm ansin idir na grúpaí pobail, cultúrtha, spóirt, na gnóanna príobháideacha agus na tionscail gnó uilig atá ag titim amach sa cheathrú Gaeltachta. Tugaim an cuireadh sin don Aire Stáit arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Bhí manna ag ceannródaithe na seanfhondúirí Ghaeltachta Bhóthar Seoighe i mBéal Feirste a cuireadh ar bun go mall sna 1950í agus go luath sna 1960í: Ná habair é, déan é. Sin an moladh a dtabharfainn do dhaoine san Oireachtas ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge agus an moladh a thabharfainn don Aire Stáit agus don Rialtas maidir leis an Ghaeilge: Ná habair é, déan é.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">Ba mhaith liom fáilte mhór a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Joe McHugh, chuig an Seanad inniu. Ba mhaith liom chomh maith buíochas a ghabháil leis as an tiomantas atá aige chun ár dteanga dúchais a spreagadh agus gúim gach rath air ina ról mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeilge agus as an nGaeltacht. Is iontach an rud é go bhfuil muid anseo inniu chun Seachtain na Gaeilge a chéiliúradh, imeacht iontach ar ár bhféilire cultúrtha bhliaintúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Is bliain tábhachtach é Seachtain na Gaeilge 2018 mar tugadh an t-ainm Bliain na Gaeilge air. Bliain iomhán é ag céiliúradh an Ghaeilge mar theanga. Tuigim go bhfuil meitheal mór oibre déanta ag an Roinn, Foras na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaelige, Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagraíochtaí éagsúla eile chun bliain rathúil a dhéanamh. ls tionscnamh iontach an t-aimniú Bhlain na Gaeilge chun a thaispeáint go bhfuil teanga bheo bhríomhar againn agus ní hamháin i bpobail éagsúla ar fud na tíre ach ar fud an domhain chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Táimid ar an eolas, áfach, go bhfuil dúshláin dáiríre fós ann don teanga. Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh agus an Seanadóir Ardagh, tá an-chuid daoine nach bhfuil an caighdeán céanna Gaelige acu agus mar a bhí. Tá an stráitéis 20 bliain ag déanamh dul chun cinn chun úsáid na teanga a ardú trasna an tíre. Tugann Seachtain na Gaeilge seans iontach do dhaoine glacadh leis an teanga agus cibé focail Ghaeilge a bhfuil acu a úsáid chomh minic agus gur féidir leo. Ba chóir go mbeadh daoine ar a suaimhneas agus iad ag caint as Gaeilge, gan faitíos a bheith orthu go ndéanfadh siad botúin.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Tá Seachtain na Gaelige ag brath go trom ar theacht le chéile de heagraíochtaí éagsúla deonacha agus ar dhíograis áitiúil. Cuireann sé seo leis an rath a bhí leis roimhe seo agus cuirfidh sé leis sna blianta atá romhainn. Beidh clár iontach ar siúI le haghaidh Seachtain na Gaeilge. Chomh maith leis na himeachtaí bliantúil atá ar siúl, tá suim agam i Rith 2018. Is tionscnamh mór é seo chun suim a chruthú sa teanga trí acIaíocht. Is modh iontach é chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh agus ag an am céanna chun daoine a spreagadh le maireachtáil go sláintiúil. Tá súil agam go Ieathnófar é seo amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Go háitiúil i Ros Comáin agus i nGaillimh beidh imeachtaí éagsúIa ar siúl le haghaidh Seachtain na Gaeilge. Go háirithe, beidh imeachtaí ar siúl sna leabharlanna do dhaoine óga. Molaim do gach duine páirt a ghlacadh sna himeachtaí i rith Seachtain na Gaeilge i mbliana. Tá an clár go léir ar fáil ar an suíomh Idirlín agus is seans iontach dúinn chun athcheangailt a dhéanamh lenár dteanga náisiúnta agus chun a bheith páirteach.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McHugh, as a bheith i láthair anseo inniu, agus guím gach rath air ina ról mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeilge.</p>

          <from>Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_278">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn inniu chun an ábhar tábhachtach seo a phlé. Cuireann sé sórt leadráin orm go minic agus mé ag éisteacht le polaiteoirí ag caint faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus ag iarraidh pointí polaitiúla a scóráil in ionad todhchaí na Gaeilge a phlé go praiticiúil agus go réalaíoch. Aontaím go huile is go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit maidir leis an dualgas atá ar phobal na tíre an Ghaeilge a chur cinn. Ní bhaineann sé sin le cúrsaí polaitiúla.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Baineann sé le muintir na hÉireann mar is le muintir na hÉireann an teanga. Tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomhá ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chruthú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach agus compórdach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid. Aontaím go huile agus go hiomlán leis an Aire Stáit faoin méid sin. </p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Caithfimid a bheith macánta faoi stádas na Gaeilge sa tír seo. Tá an-chuid páistí amuigh ansin i mBaile Átha Cliath agus in áiteanna eile ar fud na tíre a bhfuil dearg-ghráin acu ar an nGaeilge. Is fuath leo an teanga agus an t-ábhar. Theip orainn mar Stát ó thaobh múineadh na teanga de. Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin páistí amuigh ansin atá tar éis 14 bliana a chaitheamh ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus nach bhfuil in ann dhá fhocal a chur le chéile? Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin daoine amuigh ansin a bhfuil an ardteistiméireacht déanta acu agus fós nach bhfuil siad compórdach a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid ar chor ar bith? Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin páistí ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí an dara leibhéal gan móran Gaeilge acu? Táimid ag múineadh na Gaeilge ar feadh uair a chloig gach aon lá do gach páiste idir ceithre bliana agus 13 bliana d'aois ar a laghad agus fós níl caighdeán ard Gaeilge acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Bhí mise díreach mar an gcéanna nuair a bhí mé níos óige. D'fhreastal mé ar ghnáth-bhunscoil i Mullach Íde. Bhí an Ghaeilge mar ábhar ann agus ní raibh mórán spéise agam inti. B'fhéidir go raibh an locht ar an modh múinte nó b'fhéidir go raibh sé ormsa mar dhalta ach, chun na fírinne a rá, ní raibh spéis dá laghad agam féin ná ag aon duine eile a raibh in éineacht liom sa rang i gcúrsaí Gaeilge. B'é an fáth gur athraigh an meon a bhí agam ó thaobh na Gaeilge de ná gur fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil ar feadh bliana nuair a bhí mé ró-óg le dul ar aghaidh go dtí an dara leibhéal. Is é sin an t-aon fáth amháin go bhfuil Gaeilge agam anois.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Ní dóigh liom gur rud conspóideach é seo a rá, ach i mo thuairim theip orainn an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh dóibh siúd nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu ó dhúchas. Caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi sin. Ní féidir teanga a fhoghlaim ó leabhar. Ní féidir. Ní féidir teanga ar bith a fhoghlaim ó leabhar. Caithfidh an teanga a bheith ann mar theanga labhartha. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn é seo a phlé níos mó, ach tá sé thar am dúinn mar pholaiteoirí teacht le chéile, breathnú ar an gcóras oideachais atá againn ag bunleibhéal, agus a rá gur chóir dúinn bliain faoi leith a mhúineadh go huile agus go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge. Is é sin ná Gaelscoil a dhéanamh de gach aon scoil in Éirinn ar feadh bliana. Tá an méid sin ama caite againn ag múineadh na Gaeilge i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn agus níl ag éirí linn, so b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn rud éigin i bhfad níos réabhlóidí a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> B'fhéidir, mar shampla, gur chóir dúinn gach aon ábhar a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge sa tríú rang i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn. Rachadh na páistí ar aghaidh go dtí an ceathrú, cúigiú agus séú rang agus beidh Gaeilge acu go nadúrtha mar theanga labhartha. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn freisin scéim a chur le chéile chun daltaí san idirbhliain sna meánscoileanna a chur chun na Gaeltachta ar feadh coicíse.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mé ag cur béime ar dhaltaí sa Ghalltacht, mar a tugtar air, agus tá an-chuid rudaí ar siúl ag an Aire Stáit ó thaobh fhorbairt na nGaeltachtaí de. Bíonn sé ag caint faoi fhostaíocht, thithíocht agus chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, agus tá na rudaí sin thar a bheith tábhachtach chomh maith. Ag an am céanna, sílim go ndeireann daoine na rudaí céanna arís agus arís eile i ndíospóireachtaí ar nós na díospóireachta seo agus faighimid na torthaí céanna arís agus arís eile. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé maith a dhóthain do pholaiteoirí teacht isteach anseo agus a bheith ag cáineadh Fhine Gael, Fianna Fáil, an Rialtas seo ná an Rialtas a bhí ann cheana. Tá sé sin leadránach agus ní chuireann sé leis an díospóireacht. Is fadhb í seo a bhaineann leis an dearcadh atá ag mórphobal na tíre. Cinnte, baineann sé le cúrsaí polaitíochta, infheistíochta, airgid agus chuile shórt, ach is é an meon atá againn ar an teanga mar shochaí an rud is tábhachtaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Tá fás mór millteach tagtha ar an méid Gaelscoileanna atá ann ar fud na tíre le 20 bliain anuas. Tá sé sin thar cionn ach, ag breathnú ar an scoilt sin, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé maith a dhóthain go bhfuil páistí ann sa tír seo a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus páistí nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a bheith breá sásta faoi sin. Is fíor go bhfuil mé ag díriú isteach ar an gcóras oideachais ach sin an áit gur féidir linn an méid is mó agus an difríocht is mó a dhéanamh. Tá baol ann go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina rud meánaicmeach dóibh siúd a bhfuil airgead acu chun dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht, chun a gcuid páistí a chur chuige, agus chun ranganna breise a fháil dóibh siúd a bhfuil ag iarraidh Gaeilge a dhéanamh ar ardleibhéal san ardteistiméireacht. Tá an baol sin ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Tá a fhios agam féin ó mo thaithí sa scoil ina raibh mé mar phríomhoide agus ó mo thaithí mar mhúinteoir i scoil a bhí faoi mhíbhuntáiste, scoil bhocht, nár ceapadh go raibh an Ghaeilge tábhachtach dúinn. Ní raibh cumas labhartha ná léitheoireachta Béarla maith a dhóthain ag na daltaí. Bhí an méid sin deacrachtaí againn i lár chathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath leis na trioblóidí sóisialta éagsúla nach raibh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar phríomhaidhm na scoile. B'fhéidir nach raibh an ceart againn. Sin an fáth a cheapaim nár chóir é sin a dhéanamh a thuilleadh agus gur chóir go mbeidh sé mar chuspóir ag gach aon scoil in Éirinn cainteoirí flúirseacha líofa a chur go dtí an dara leibhéal. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn, in ionad na pointí polaitiúla sin a scóráil ar a chéile, teacht le chéile agus breathnú ar an gcóras oideachais atá againn. Cosnódh sé airgid agus bheadh orainn múinteoirí a thraenáil agus chuile shórt. Ní bheadh sé sin éasca. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn plean cúig-bliana a chur le chéile chun an rud a chur i gcrích. Ag an am céanna, dá mbeadh gach aon rang agus ábhar múinte trí Ghaeilge i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn ar feadh bliana, samhlaigh an caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh ag na páistí ag deireadh na bliana sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil Bliain na Gaeilge againn le haitheantas a thabhairt do thábhacht na Gaeilge mar sheoid cultúrtha atá beo, bríomhar agus mar chuid lárnach de phobal na Gaeltachta. Ní féidir, mar sin féin, an Ghaeilge a cheiliúradh gan dianscrúdú a dhéanamh ar na nithe gur gá dúinn a dhéanamh chun í a chosaint. Tá líon na gcainteoirí laethúla ag titim go tapaidh. Tá 11% níos lú cainteoirí laethúla againn sna ceantair Ghaeltachta de réir an daonáireamh is déanaí. Is ábhar mór imní é seo, mar gan Ghaeltacht agus tobar beo na Gaeilge, beidh an teanga féin go mór i mbaol.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Leis an nGaeilge a threisiú, is gá don Rialtas díriú isteach ar bhealaí difriúla chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach. Is fiú go mór breis maoiniú a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta gan amhras, ach is gá infheistíocht a dhéanamh sa chóras oideachais fosta - sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht araon. Tá gá le cultúrlann a bhunú i mBaile Átha Cliath. Tá sé dochreidte nach bhfuil ceann againn cheana féin. Is áit é a fhreastalóidh ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge inár bpríomhchathair.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Tá cultúrlann ann do lucht na Fraince, na Gearmáine agus na Spáinne, ach níl cultúrlann ann do na Gaeil. Is gá don Rialtas meas a léiriú dár dteanga agus do phobal na Gaeltachta. Ní hionann meas agus béalghrá. Ní hionann teanga a shábháil agus rudaí deasa a rá fúithi. Táimid ar fad ar aon fhocal maidir le luach na Gaeilge. Tá sé in am don Rialtas beart a dhéanamh de réir a bhriathar. Tá sé in am dúinn uilig treabhadh le chéile le cinntiú go slánófar an Ghaeilge.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo. Creidim go bhfuil sé dáiríre, gníomhach agus éifeachtach sa ról atá aige. Thug sé dea-shampla dúinn nuair a chuaigh sé ar ais chun a chuid Gaeilge a athfhoghlaim. Rinne sé sár-jab leis sin. Tugann an dea-shampla sin dúshlán dúinn go léir an rud céanna a dhéanamh. Ba chóir dúinn go léir ár ndícheall a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a labhairt sa Teach seo, agus i dTeach Laighean i gcoitinne, leo siúd atá sásta í a labhairt linn. Ba chóir dúinn a rá ar an gcéad dul síos gur fiú an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus a fhoghlaim. Tá ár n-oidhreacht agus ár ndúthracht ceangailte leis an nGaeilge. Is eochair í an teanga do bhéaloideas, litríocht, ceol, rince agus drámaíocht na tíre seo. Ba chóir í a úsáid agus a fhoghlaim. Is iontach an rud é go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge ar siúl, agus ba chóir go mbeadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> Tréaslaím leis an jab iontach atá ar siúl ag eagraíochtaí cosúil le Foras na Gaeilge agus Conradh na Gaeilge. Tá an-mheas pearsanta agam ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Sílim go ndéanann an eagraíocht sin jab speisialta chun ceol agus rince na tíre seo a choimeád beo. Ba chóir gur chúis bhróid atá ann dúinn go bhfuil iarSheanadóir, Labhrás Ó Murchú, mar ardstiúrthóir ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Tá an-mheas agam ar an obair a dhéanann lucht an chomhaltais.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> Is maith an rud é go bhfuil na Gaelscoileanna ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus ag méadú, go háirithe sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra. Ag an am céanna, is cúis díomá agus cúis bhróin é dúinn go léir go bhfuil cineál meath ag teacht ar an nGaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá ísliú agus laghdú ag teacht ar líon na gcainteoirí líofa sa Ghaeltacht. Molaim don Aire forbairt agus fostaíocht a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht chun é sin a athrú. Ba cheart iarracht mhór a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht chun na daoine a choimeád ann agus an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> Aontaím leis an mhéid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Ríordáin mar gheall ar mhodhanna múinte. Ós rud é go bhfuil daoine ag fágáil na scoile gan Gaeilge líofa, is léir go bhfuil rud éigin cearr inár modhanna múinte ag an mbomaite. Ba chóir dúinn níos mó béime a chur ar an teanga labhartha. Go háirithe, ba chóir dúinn béim a chur ar dhaltaí a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar feadh an tsamhraidh. Tá mé an-chinnte gurb é sin an rud is fearr gur féidir linn a dhéanamh. Nuair a chuaigh mo chlann go dtí an Ghaeltacht, mo mhac ina measc, chabhraigh sé go mór mór leo. Fuair siad grá dár gcultúr sa Ghaeltacht. Chuaigh mé féin ann nuair a bhí mé óg agus bhí sé go hiontach. Molaim don Aire Stáit níos mó a dhéanamh. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire Stáit dáiríre faoin gceist seo, ach caithfear níos mó a dhéanamh chun na mic léinn a mhealladh. Ba cheart dúinn cabhair a thabhairt dóibh, go háirithe dóibh siúd nach bhfuil chomh saibhir, b'fhéidir. Sílim gurb é seo an eochair is tábhachtaí agus molaim don Aire Stáit é. Ba mhaith liom é a chloisteáil ar an gceist seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Tá mé lán i bhfábhar na comharthaí bóthair a chur suas as Gaeilge ar fud na tíre. Ba chóir é sin a dhéanamh go tapaidh leis na logainmneacha a choimeád beo. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé leagtha amach ag an Aire Stáit ina ráiteas go bhfuil sé an-chinnte agus an-dáiríre faoin ábhar seo. Sílim gur fiú é seo a dhéanamh. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach freisin go mbeadh seans ag daoine a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh leis an Státsheirbhís agus leis na comhairlí contae, srl., trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ba cheart go mbeadh dóthain Státsheirbhíseach ar fáil chun dul i dteagmháil le daoine i nGaeilge agus an deis seo a thabhairt don phobal. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé seo sa straitéis. Ba chóir dúinn é seo a dhéanamh chomh maith leis na comharthaí. Mar fhocal scoir, sílim go bhfuil athrú ag teastáil ní hamháin i dtaobh na modhanna múinte ach freisin i dtaobh líon na ndaoine a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht.</p>

          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_295">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Agus Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan beagnach tagtha, guím gach rath ní hamháin ar mhná na hÉireann ach freisin ar mhná Gaelach na hÉireann ag an am seo. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis againn uilig labhairt ar an ábhar seo i gcomhthéacs Sheachtain na Gaeilge. Mar Ghaillmheach, tá spéis faoi leith agam i dtodhchaí na Gaeilge mar theanga Eorpach agus mar theanga phobail. Ba cheart dúinn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar bhonn poiblí agus i ngach réimse de shaol na tíre seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> De réir gach tuairisc, tá meath fós ag teacht ar an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail sna Gaeltachtaí ina bhfuil formhór na gcainteoirí dúchasacha ag cur fúthu. Níos práinní arís, níl an Státchóras ag cabhrú leis an scéal. Tá brón orm a rá gur cosúil nach bhfuil mórán tionchar le feiceáil de thairbhe Acht na Gaeltachta 2012. Nach mór deich mbliana ó shin, fógraíodh sa straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge go ndéanfaí forbairt ar chearta an phobail an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus iad ag plé leis an Stát. Bhí sé mar sprioc sa straitéis 2010-30 go ndéanfaí líon na ndaoine a úsáideann seirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge a ardú. Le bheith macánta faoi, is beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta i leith na gceisteanna sin ó shin. Is léir do chách go bhfuil meath suntasach tagtha ar an nGaeilge laistigh den Státchóras le 20 bliain anuas. Caithfear an fhadhb mhór seo a réiteach go práinneach. Mura dtugtar aghaidh ar an bhfírinne seo ar shlí oscailte agus macánta, leanfaidh creimeadh na Gaeilge ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht, ach lasmuigh de chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Ba mhaith liom tacú leis na héilimh phraiticiúla indéanta atá curtha chun cinn ag cainteoirí Gaeilge agus ag na heagrais Ghaeilge le blianta anuas. Caithfear gníomhú láithreach maidir leis na trí rudaí is tábhachtaí: na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis na scéimeanna teanga, cúrsaí earcaíochta sa Státseirbhís agus dualgais an Stáit maidir le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta. I mo thuairim, an áit a dtéann an earnáil phoiblí, is ansin a rachaidh an earnáil phríobháideach agus neamhspleách. Mura gcinntítear go bhfuil íosmhéid foirne le Gaeilge i ngach eagraíocht Stáit a chuireann seirbhís ar fáil don phobal, agus mura méadaítear ar líon na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge sa Státchóras, beidh an chosmhuintir amhrasach nach bhfuil ach cur i gcéill i gceist ag an Stát maidir le cearta lucht labhartha na Gaeilge agus cainteoirí mionteangacha eile i gcoitinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Cuimhnímís go labhraítear os cionn 100 teanga ar bhonn laethúil in Éirinn ilteangach ár linne agus an Ghaeilge san áireamh dar ndóigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> Go bunúsach, caithfidh cúrsaí earcaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh de a bheith ag freagairt do na pleananna cuimsithe do sholáthar seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge a chur na saineolaí éagsúla chun cinn le tamall de bhlianta anuas. Ní dhéanfar seo gan na caighdeáin is airde ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge a leagan síos trí chóras rialacháin ar na heagraíochtaí sin is mó a bhíonn ag soláthar seirbhísí don phobal, go háirithe iad siúd a fheidhmíonn sna Gaeltachtaí. Ní féidir teanga a choinneáil beo beathach ar chomhaid Stáit agus ar thuairiscí bladhmannacha neamhréalaíocha. Díol suntais é go bhfuil todhchaí na Gaeilge i mbéal an phobail agus ina cnámh spairne ó Thuaidh fiú agus an Ghaeilge ag an am céanna ag creimeadh ó Dheas. Is ait an mac an tsaoil, mar a deir an seanfhocal.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Ag caint ar an Tuaisceart agus ar ár gcomharsain sa Bhreatain agus san Eoraip, le déanaí bhí sé de phribhléid agam féin labhairt faoin nGaeilge is faoin Ultaise san Eoraip ar na mallaibh i Strasbourg, san Fhrainc, ag an gcéiliúradh 20 bliain den European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, mar a thugtar as Béarla air. Ar an ócáid chéanna, chuir mé ina luí ar chomhghleacaithe san Eoraip agus muintir na Breataine, ar shínitheoirí den ráiteas céanna iad, gur ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine agus go ndéanfaimid ár ndícheall le chéile chun todhchaí na Gaeilge mar theanga Eorpaigh ar bhonn phoiblí agus i ngach réimse de shaol na tíre seo a threisiú is a chinntiú.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Níl ach beagán Gaeilge agam ach tá cónaí orm sa Ghaeltacht agus tá sé tábhachtach dom go mairfidh an Ghaeltacht. Táim ag iarraidh go mbeadh fostaíocht agus seirbhísí ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht ionas go mbeidh daoine in ann fanacht ann. Tá daoine ag iarraidh a bheith ag obair sa bhaile ach ní féidir leo mar níl aon seirbhís leathanbhanda ann. Caithfidh an Rialtas níos mó airgid a thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta. Gan daoine ina gcónaí agus ag obair sa Ghaeltacht, ní bheidh Gaeltacht ann agus níl mórán ama againn chun an Ghaeltacht a chosaint. Nílimid ag iarraidh plean eile. Caithfidh an Rialtas an beart a dhéanamh. Tabhair dúinn an t-airgead i gcomhair na mbóithre. Tabhair poist do na daoine óga ann agus cuir seirbhísí bunúsacha ar fáil. Déan na rudaí seo agus feicfimid ansin an bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis na Seandóirí fá choinne na moltaí a rinne siad. Le bheith ionraic, moltaí dearfa agus, i gcúpla cás, moltaí úra a bhí ann. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Seanadóir Ardagh fá choinne a moladh maidir le hAire sinsearach le freagracht as an Ghaeilge a bheith timpeall bhord an Rialtais. Rud dearfach ab ea é nuair a bhí mise timpeall bhord an Rialtais agus achan rud maidir leis an Ghaeilge nó leis an Ghaeltacht á phlé achan seachtain. Bíonn sé níos fearr a bheith ag an bhord. An fáth a bhíonn mise ag an mbord Rialtais ná gur mise an Príomh-Aoire agus ní bhím ag bord an Rialtais mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an Ghaeltacht cé gur measc den dá rud mise. Chím na buntáistí a bhaineann leis an cheangal sin agus beidh mé ábalta labhairt i dtaobh sin amach anseo fosta.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh faoina mholtaí. Bíonn sé i gcónaí ag smaoineamh ar an teanga agus ní do sheachtain amháin nó ócáid amháin. Ní hé sin atá i gceist leis. Mar atá a fhios aige óna bheith ag siúl timpeall an fhoirgnimh seo, bíonn na ushers agus na lads sa bheár ag déanamh fíor-iarracht an teanga a labhairt. Mar shampla, inniu bhí sé nóiméad agam don lón idir Ord an Ghnó sa Dáil agus teacht anseo agus bhí mé ag labhairt le Keith sa bheár. Chuir sé ceist orm faoi chúpla focal mar tá sé ag tabhairt cuidiú dá leanaí. Tá sé sin suimiúil agus dearfa.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Labhair an Seanadóir faoi na coláistí samhraidh fosta. Tá siad san thar a bheith tábhachtach. Beidh deiseanna agus buntáistí ann amach anseo agus beidh an Rialtas ag lorg daoine breise fá choinne na Státseirbhíse. Bíonn coláistí samhraidh ar fáil tríd an gheimhreadh fosta. Bíonn cuid mhór foirgnimh folamh tríd an gheimhreadh agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh seans ansin. Labhair an Seanadóir faoin infheistíocht agus faoin struchtúr. Tá cuid mhór de shaol stairiúil maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh fosta. Tá Coláiste Uladh i nGort a Choirce i mo chontae féin agus tháinig Roger Casement ann in 1908 agus chuir sé ceithre scór punt ar fáil don fhoirgneamh sin. Fuair siad cuidiú mhór ó trí bhean Preispitéireach ó na Glens of Antrim ag an am sin. Ní raibh polaitíocht ag baint leis an teanga ag an am agus bhí sé sin níos dearfaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Labhair an Seanadóir faoi cheangal a dhéanamh idir na daoine atá lasmuigh agus laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí ionas go mbeadh siad ag casadh lena chéile. Bheinn sásta éisteacht le haon mholtaí i dtaobh sin. Labhair sé fosta faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir go bhfuil an t-údarás faoi bhrú. Tá cuid mhór comhlachtaí ag déanamh teagmhála leis an údarás faoi láthair agus iad ag iarraidh spáis agus foirgnimh úir. Muna bhfuil na foirgnimh ar fáil, beidh siad faoi bhrú.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Tá mise ag leanúint ar aghaidh le mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire, an Teachta Humphreys, anois mar tá breis airgid ag IDA Ireland agus Enterprise Ireland. D'athraigh an polasaí an bhliain a chuaigh thart agus polasaí réigiúnach atá ann anois. Dá mbeadh cuidiú ón údarás i gceantair iargúlta, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé fite fuaite inár measc ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus IDA Ireland fosta. Má tá aon smaointe ag an Teach i dtaobh sin, tá mé ar fáil. Beidh mé sásta casadh leis an Seanadóir arís i ndiaidh Lá Fhéile Pádraig agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don lá a luaigh sé fosta.</p>

Bhí seans agam Dé Luain labhairt le daoine i mBéal Feirste a bhí páirteach in ócáid maidir leis an tsláinte agus labhair siad faoin teanga, faoin stair agus faoi rudaí dá leithéid.</p>

Bíonn mise agus comhghleacaí an Seanadóra, an Teachta Aengus Ó Snodaigh, ag obair le chéile ar an Choiste Gnó.

          <p eId="para_316">Bhí an Seanadóir ag caint faoin obair atá déanta ag Conradh na Gaeilge agus ag Foras na Gaeilge fosta. Aontaím leis sin. Tá dualgais mhóra orthu leis sin. Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Donnghaile, "Ná habair é, déan é." Tá sin níos soiléire. Gabhaim buíochas leis faoi sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Dúirt mo chomhghleacaí ó Ros Comáin, an Seanadóir Hopkins, go bhfuil scéal dearfach ag dul ar aghaidh sa chontae sin fosta. Nuair a bhí mé ag déanamh stocaireachta i Ros Comáin cúpla bliain ó shin, bhí sé infheicthe go raibh daoine ag déanamh fíor-iarracht ar son na teanga. Gabhaim m'aitheantas don education and training board agus eagrais mar sin. Níl easpa iarrachta i gceist ansin. Bhí an Seanadóir ag labhairt faoin dúshlán a ghabhann le bheith ag labhairt na teanga gan fhaitíos nó gan eagla. D'fhoghlaim mé focal úr. B'fhéidir gur focal Chonamara é "scéin". An é sin focal faoi choinne "fear" fosta? An ionann é agus "eagla" nó "faitíos"? Sin an áit ina raibh mise in 2014. Roimh 2014 bhí eagla orm maidir le botúin a dhéanamh. Nuair a thosaigh mé ar m'aistear féin, tháinig an fhéinmhuinín a bhí agam sa mheánscoil ar ais. Nuair atá an fhéinmhuinín ag duine, tá sé nó sí ar an bhealach ceart. Ní chóir a bheith buartha faoin eagla, an scéin ná an faitíos. Bhí an Seanadóir ag labhairt faoin gcuidiú ar an Idirlíon freisin. Tá mór-chuidiú ar an Idirlíon agus tá cúpla suíomh, <i>tearma.ie</i> agus <i>focloir.ie</i> mar shampla, ann atá maith agus cuidiúil fosta.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Ba é an Seanadóir Aodhán Ó Ríordáin an chéad Sheanadóir eile. Níl sé anseo ach ba mhaith liom teachtaireacht phearsanta chuige a chur ar an taifead fá choinne an chuidithe pearsanta ar thug sé dom nuair a tháinig mé chuig an Roinn. Ba chomhghleacaí liom é ag an am atá ina iar-chomhghleacaí liom anois. Gabhaim buíochas leis faoi sin. Bhí sé ag caint faoin dualgas atá ar phobal na hÉireann. Bhí an ceart aige. Tá dualgas orainn uilig - ar na Seanadóirí, ar na ushers a oibríonn sa Teach, agus ar na daoine uilig timpeall na tíre taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus taobh istigh di - chun an teanga, ár gcultúr agus ár n-oidhreacht a choimeád beo. Bhí sé ag caint faoi chaighdeáin. Tá caighdeán níos airde de dhíth do na daoine atá ag iarraidh na poist bhreise san Eoraip a bhaint amach nó do na daoine proifisiúnta. Ach is léir go bhfuil daoine ann sa tír seo atá ag iarraidh an teanga a labhairt agus ní bheadh suim acu faoin ghramadach ná rudaí mar sin. Tá dualgas orainn uilig cuidiú a thabhairt do na daoine sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Labhair an Seanadóir faoin dteip ollmhór fosta. In 2015, chuir mé tús le díospóireacht agus comhairliúchán cuimsitheach idir an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta faoi mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Táim thar a bheith buíoch as an chuidiú a fuair muidne ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. I Meán Fómhair i mbliana beimid ag amharc ar an pholasaí oideachais tríd na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá sé dochreidte go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin de dhíth, ach sna cheantair laga sa Ghaeltacht beidh tumoideachas ag dul ón gcéad bhliain go dtí an dara bliain. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine uilig sa Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go dtiocfaidh daoine le chéile. Chuala mé ráitis agus seanfhocal i Meiriceá ó bhean ó Chonamara a bhfuil aithne ag an Seanadóir uirthi, Máire Concannon. Dúirt sí go gcasann daoine ar a chéile ach nach gcasann na sléibhte ná na cnoic ar a chéile. Tá daoine ábalta casadh ar a chéile agus bualadh lena chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir Warfield faoina mholtaí agus a iarracht. Bhí sé ag caint faoi ionaid Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Eoraip. Táim thar a bheith sásta leis an mholadh sa phlean náisiúnta faoi ionad Gaeilge i gcathair Bhaile Átha Cliath. Tá sé dochreidte nach bhfuil a leithéid d'ionad lonnaithe i gcathair Bhaile Átha Cliath faoin am seo ach táim dóchasach go mbeidh dul chun cinn air. Bhí mé ag labhairt leis na leaids ó Chonradh na Gaeilge agus le mo chuid oifigeach faoi. Beimid ag déanamh ár mbealach faoi sin amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Bíonn díospóireachtaí i gcónaí faoi mhaoiniú, airgead agus acmhainní. Chím na deacrachtaí faoi sin. Sé bliana nó seacht mbliana ó shin bhí an Rialtas agus an tír ar an talamh. Táimid ag iarraidh dul go dtí spás dearfach. Ní bheimid ábalta dul go dtí an áit inar mhaith liom a bheith faoi láthair, ach táimid ag amharc ar an phlean deich mbliana. Dá mbeadh moltaí nó tograí ar intinn an Seanadóra faoin todhchaí, is é sin an t-am gur ceart na smaointe a chur le chéile agus muid ag iarraidh an bealach is fearr a aimsiú.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Thug mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Joe O'Reilly, aitheantas do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Bhí sé ag caint faoi dhualgais maidir leis an oidhreacht, an cultúr, agus an teanga. Bhí sé ag caint freisin faoin laghdú ar líon na ndaoine le Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis na daoine atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht agus tugaim aitheantas dóibh. Is iad sin na daoine a choimeádann an teanga beo - na daoine a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge achan lá. Tógadh iad le Gaeilge agus labhraíonn siad í achan lá. Ní labhraíonn siad í i rith Sheachtain na Gaeilge amháin agus sin an spás ina mbeidh muid ábalta dul ag smaoineamh faoin nGaeilge agus í a chur chun cinn. Níl sé i gceist d'achan duine sa tír é sin a dhéanamh, cé go bhfuil sí i gcroí achan duine, ach dóibh siúd a dhéanann a ndícheall. Is cuma má tá duine ina chonaí i Maigh Eo, in Átha Cliath, i nGaillimh nó i nDún na nGall, is é sin an dúshlán is mó.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Dúirt an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív roimh an Nollaig seanfhocal nár chuala mé roimhe; ná déan nós agus ná bris nós. Do not make a habit and do not break a habit. B'fhéidir gur bhris mise agus muidne an nós gan an Ghaeilge a labhairt i ndiadh na hardteistiméireachta. Tá sé sin thar a bheith suimiúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Bhí an Seanadóir O'Reilly ag caint faoi dhaoine gan airgead nach bhfuil in ann dul go dtí na campaí samhraidh nó na coláistí samhraidh. Sin dúshlán mór agus bhí mé ag caint faoi sin thar na mblianta. B'fhéidir go mbeadh smaoineamh maith againn faoi sin fosta. Bhí an Seanadóir O'Reilly agus an Seanadóir Mullen ag caint faoin Státseirbhís freisin. Sa Bhille teanga úr, beimid ag amharc ar líon na ndaoine le Gaeilge a earcaítear a mhéadú go dtí 20% den iomlán. Sin an bhealach is fearr chun seirbhís a chur ar fáil do dhaoine le Gaeilge. Tá sin níos fearr fosta. Beidh sé sin i gceist istigh sna Gaeltachtaí agus sa Státchóras fosta.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">Tháinig an t-aitheantas in 2007 maidir leis an aitheantas sin. Beidh suas le 180 poist ar fáil in 2021 nuair a bheidh an maolú thart maidir leis an rud sin. Tá deiseanna ollmhóra leis sin. Tá cuid mhór ag dul ar aghaidh do cheantar na Gaillimhe, mar shampla Gnó le Gaeilge i gceantar na Gaillimhe agus in 2015 thug me aitheantas fhoirmiúil chuig na bailte seirbhíse mar shampla, cathair na Gaillimhe, Daingean Uí Chúis, Leitir Ceanainn agus sin an áit a bheidh reachtaíocht fhoirmiúil ar son na teanga fosta agus dá mbeadh aon fhoirgneamh nó áiseanna de dhíth ar son na teanga, beidh an reachtaíocht sin tábhachtach. Bhí<b>
						</b>tú ag labhairt faoin earcaíocht agus dúirt tú fosta ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine.

          <p eId="para_328"> Tá mé an-dearfach faoin todhchaí, tá na daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge, na daoine gan Ghaeilge, cúpla focal, na daoine le Gaeilge briste agus na daoine le Gaeilge lag nó Gaeilge láidir. Tá an dualgas arís orainn uilig agus dá mbeadh aon chuidiú ar fáil sa Seanad nó ag obair le chéile taobh amuigh de chúrsaí polaitíochta, beidh mé sásta é sin a dhéanamh.

          <p eId="para_331">I thank Senators for the invitation to address the Seanad in its temporary home. On 6 February last, I launched the Government's programme to commemorate the centenary of the introduction of voting rights for women in parliamentary elections. The programme booklet reprints a remarkable piece of correspondence from Prime Minister Lloyd George to Countess Markievicz in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland. The letter is a short, formal three-sentence invitation to Countess Markievicz to attend the re-opening of Parliament at Westminster. It addresses the new Member of Parliament as "Sir" and the envelope has the original postal address of Dublin St. Patrick's, the constituency to which Countess Markievicz was elected and which, as it happens, is now the constituency of Dublin Rathdown that I represent. However, the address is written over and redirected to Holloway Prison London. In these two small details, we can detect the seismic changes in the political landscape of our world 100 years ago. While the system had just opened its doors to women's participation in political life, it still could not quite believe that the MP for Dublin St. Patrick's was not "Sir" but "Madam", and the self-same madam, instead of taking a seat in his majesty's parliament, was incarcerated in his majesty's prison as a result of her political activities in seeking an independent Irish republic. These two joint but separate campaigns - the struggle for Irish freedom and the struggle for women's political rights - were at the core of Countess Markievicz's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The Representation of the People Act 1918, enacted on the 6 February 100 years ago, gave some women aged over 30 years and all men over the age of 21 years the right to vote for the first time. The Act had the effect of tripling the size of the electorate, which no doubt had a significant impact on the subsequent election. The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918, which was passed in November 1918, further allowed women to stand for election on an equal footing with men for the first time. In the subsequent general election, 17 women stood but only Countess Markievicz was elected. In Ireland, Sinn Féin alone put forward women candidates, namely, Constance Markievicz who was victorious in the Dublin St. Patrick's constituency and Winifred Carney in Belfast Victoria. Women would have to await passage of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act 1922 by the Third Dáil for full and equal voting rights in time for the election to the Fourth Dáil on 27 August 1923. It is no consolation that women in the United Kingdom did not achieve equal franchise until 1928.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Meanwhile, Countess Markievicz would become a member of Dáil Éireann and became our first female Cabinet Minister in 1919. It would take another 60 years before another woman sat at the Cabinet table in Government Buildings. As Senators are no doubt aware, there have been 103 woman Senators in this House to date, including the 15 incumbents. While women have secured their seats in this House via a broad range of panels, it is noteworthy that thus far more than one third have been appointed by the Taoiseach of the day. I hope to see many more women serve in this House and the Dáil in future and, importantly, to see also a significant improvement in the proportion of Members of both Houses who are women. While many improvements have been already implemented to underpin progress in this area, our work is ongoing to ensure any remaining soft or hard barriers to women's participation in Parliament are eliminated and replaced by an environment in which all those who wish to serve have equal access to the resources required to facilitate that achievement, regardless of their gender. Some Senators may have a copy of the centenary programme I announced in February, which outlines some of the key commemorative events that will be held during the year, including exhibitions, celebrations, hedge schools, talks, stamps and seminars. </p>
          <p eId="para_334">The programme complements the Vótáil 100 commemorations organised by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I recently distributed a copy to each Member of the Seanad. It will be delivered by many partners, including the national cultural institutions, History Ireland, the local authorities, trade unions and third level institutions. One highlight will be a pop-up museum depicting 100 years of involvement by women in politics and public life. It will look at the key women who contributed in the past 100 years to shaping the State, including the women who have served in Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann during that period. The exhibition which is curated by the historian Sinéad McCoole will be housed in Dublin Castle from November and then travel to regional venues.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> We are reflecting on the significant contribution women have made to the country in the last century, but we are also reflecting on the missed opportunities for women and society in the conservative state which came into being after Independence. The Houses of the Oireachtas have done much to progress the legislative framework to provide better and equal opportunities for all, but we still have a way to travel. It is timely, during the centenary year of such a key milestone for women, to redouble our efforts to further expand and enhance the scope for women to realise opportunities.</p>

          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_336">Saying today that there was a time when women could not vote, same-sex marriage was not allowed and slavery was legal seems insane in our modern world. Things that are now normal and taken for granted were unheard of 100 years ago, yet there are things that are still perceived to be normal that in 50 years will seem to be insane. In the 100 years since women won the right to vote, there have been millions upon millions of stories of strong women forging the way ahead, fighting for equality of treatment, thought and action. Today wives, daughters, aunts, mothers, grandmothers and sisters are still fighting and it is not for special treatment but for the same treatment. In the #MeToo campaign women are simply asking for decency in thought, treatment, action and opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> Recently, while carrying a large amount of baggage outside this very building in heading to celebrate Constance Markievicz, I was having trouble in closing the car door. A man who was walking by helped me to close it. I did not get to thank him, not because he had helped a woman but because he had helped a human being who needed help. He helped me having seen the packages and a hand scrambling for the door. He treated me in the same way he would have liked to be treated and it occurred to me how unusual it was that this had happened. </p>
          <p eId="para_338"> We must celebrate women and their stories such as those of Constance Markievicz who was the first ever female MP to be elected, who as an Irish Republican chose not to take her seat, who later served as Minister for Labour in the First Dáil and who was a founding member of Fianna Fáil in 1926. There were Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and her literal glass breaking at Dublin Castle, the then seat of British power in Ireland, and her granddaughter Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington who won her case at the Equality Tribunal almost 100 years later in 2014. We recall the stories of Kathleen Lynn, the chief medical officer during the 1916 Easter Rising; Rosie Hackett, the long-time trade unionist, and the nurse Margaret Keogh who was the first female casualty in the conflict. They were trailblazers, not just because they were women but also because they had seen an injustice and sought to put it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> In the 100 years since that milestone it is appalling that some changes have not yet come. Just under one third of the Members of this Chamber are female, less than in the other House. The recently appointed Taoiseach actually lightened the female loading in the Cabinet. In Ireland today women are not equal. They are called love, darling and sweetheart and often talked over, talked down to and sometimes taken for fools. This inequality is reflected in boardrooms, managerial positions and, worst of all, pay levels. Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918 should serve as a reminder of how far we have actually not come and the mountains we still have to climb.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Fianna Fáil is actively seeking equality in every sector. We seek an Ireland in which one can be what one wants to be, regardless of gender, orientation, place of birth or bank balance. We are committed to addressing issues such as the gender pay gap, the barriers to female political participation and expanding boardroom membership for women. I applaud the brave Irish women who take a stand to represent the people. I encourage more and more of them to walk these halls, speak loudly and clearly, represent women and men, old and young, fight injustices, root out inequality and be taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> There has been much talk of the 40% increase in female representation in Parliament since 2011. It was brought about by the introduction of gender quotas, which allowed for a party's State funding to be cut by one half, unless 30% of its general election candidates were women and 30% were men. I suggest we have worked hard. While we have worked hard, I encourage more women to become involved. It is not about men or women but about the work women could do. This is crucial. For real change to happen, we have to begin again and begin with children. Just as the colour of one's skin no more matters than the make of one's coat in terms of one's ability to do the job, it should not matter that I am a woman. How I do my job is what should matter, which is why I think the landscape has to change fundamentally. We should not have to create a female friendly society in which women can run for office. A woman should be able to run for office because she would be good at the job. There should be no special treatment, just reward for a job well done, regardless of gender. Cultural barriers must be addressed through the education system, civic education programmes and voter education initiatives. A review of fathers' rights and paternity leave should also be undertaken in order that children will not always be seen as an issue for mothers only. There should be equality wherever we turn in this land for us to honour properly those who fought for us 100 years ago. I should be able to tell my story because I have a story to tell, not just because I am a woman.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> This is all about women. I am proud to be a Senator and represent the women of Ireland. I am proud that some day I will be able to tell my story and that I am fighting for women to have equal rights. We do not have equal rights. Things have not changed much. They have changed to some extent and we have to welcome the changes made, but there needs to be much more. I know that we will fight harder as women here because we are workers, dedicated and proud to be Irish.</p>

          <from>Senator Maura Hopkins<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan. It is wonderful to have such a well informed, capable, hard-working and knowledgeable individual as one of the senior Cabinet Ministers. I wish her well in her new role and have no doubt that she will do an exemplary job. Her contribution is important in asking us to reflect on the significant contribution women have made to the country in the last century. When the Minister spoke, I was reminded of a wonderful woman by the name of Joan Burke, the first female Deputy for County Roscommon. She stood in a by-election following the untimely death of her husband, James Burke. She was a trained nurse who had overcome the pressures of raising young children. She came from a farming background and took her late husband's seat in the by-election of 1964. She successfully contested subsequent elections in 1965, 1969, 1973 and 1977. She topped the poll in each of them, which cannot have been easy. During her time in politics she was vocally opposed to the marriage ban and worked very hard on the rights of farmers. The people clearly recognised her work and she continued to regain her seat in each subsequent election.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">She was a woman of substance, one who worked hard, who told the truth and was always ready to help others. When I started my political journey, approximately four years ago, she inspired me. She was very grateful for the support she got but also understood that it involved responsibility and she took that very seriously. As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the giving of voting rights to women and the resulting election of women to parliament, it is important that we reflect on people like the late Joan Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> We look forward to celebrating this important centenary with the wonderful programme of events put together by the hardworking Vótáil 100 committee, led by Senator Bacik and made up of many fellow female Senators and Deputies. It is important to acknowledge the contribution of many women curators, academics, librarians, historians and educators who have also contributed to the programme. Their contribution has been invaluable.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> I look forward to Díospóireacht na nÓg, which I understand is taking place in April in this Chamber. This is a very important place for young people and hopefully for future female public representatives to engage in public debate and understand how their participation can make a difference. The Minister has reflected on Countess Markievicz, Hannah Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins, born in Roscommon, who made such a major contribution to the role of women in today's society, 100 years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> While much progress has been made, however, many barriers still exist. Politics and political life remain overwhelmingly a male preserve. Female representation is 22% in the Dáil and 32% in the Seanad. Gender quotas have made a difference and helped more women put themselves forward as candidates but it is important that we are not seen as token candidates. We wanted to ensure that women are supported because they are informed, capable, knowledgeable and hard working, and just as capable as men. While the issue of family life applies to men and women alike it is exacerbated for female representatives. Being a Senator, a Deputy or a councillor demands a great deal of effort, time and work, which will have an impact on family life. The job needs to be made a bit more family friendly, for example in terms of the long hours. No matter what we celebrate today and this year it is important that we continue to break through those glass ceilings. The aim of this programme is to recognise the role of women in our society and hopefully it can bring about even more positive change and more women will become politically involved and continue to influence change for everybody in our society.</p>

        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_348">I congratulate the Minister, I was delighted by her appointment. It is great to see a woman of her calibre in that position. I am glad that she is here today. As she said in her opening statement, we have much to celebrate since Countess Markievicz, the increased number of women in political life and in other decision-making roles. I very much welcome that. While women have been appointed to senior positions, for example, Maggie Thatcher was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and there have been women presidents in this country, which was positive, we also need to question ourselves and look under the layers to see what is happening to women, to assess how far we have come or not come in some areas. Last month, it was exactly five years since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, apologised to the women from the Magdalen laundries on behalf of the State. He made a very sincere apology. He said that Mr. Justice John Quirke’s review with the recommendations of the provision of payments and support including medical cards and psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs for women would all be provided. There was also a commitment to a staff consultative unit led by Mr. Justice Quirke. It is very distressing for me as a woman to have found out earlier this week that seven of those women passed away without those promises being kept. Words are empty unless the promises are kept, and the actions underpinning them are delivered on.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> The Minister spoke about the pop-up museum, which is a very good initiative, and I commend all the women on the Vótáil 100 committee, particularly the chairperson, Senator Bacik, and the other women for the work they have done in progressing all of that. It demonstrates what can be done in a short space of time to promote women. I am mindful of the other women such as Catherine Corless who tells us that in spite of all the good earnest work she has done on the Tuam babies she is not getting the support she needs from Galway County Council. We need to put those supports in place so that she can finish the job she set out to do. I am also mindful of Louise O'Keeffe from Cork. Will she be remembered in a pop-up museum? How is she acknowledged for the battle she fought to recognise, and have recognised, the abuse that happened to her as a child? In some places the State will say that it supports women, that it wants more women in decision-making roles and to be part of our public life yet in cases such as that of Louise O'Keeffe it will use all the instruments and money available to the State to stop people like Louise O'Keeffe and others having a voice. That worries me. Another key recommendation in respect of the Magdalen women was that a permanent memorial would be established to them but that has not been delivered. An opportunity has now arisen for the establishment of a consultative process for the women and a memorial at the former Sean McDermott Street laundry site. The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for the oversight and delivery of those recommendations but has made little effort to advance the proposed memorial. Psychologically, it hurts those women even more now when the promises contained in the apology are not delivered on in a timely way.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">It is important that achievements and suffering be acknowledged by suitable memorials. That could include the naming of prominent buildings such as the new national children’s hospital, which offers an opportunity to honour a revolutionary patriot, the Mayo woman Dr. Kathleen Lynn. She challenged many of the societal norms for women at that time. She was a suffragette, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, the first resident doctor in the Eye and Ear Hospital, instrumental in the roll-out of the BCG vaccine, a soup kitchen worker during the 1913 Lock-out, a volunteer with the Irish Citizen Army, the commanding officer of the City Hall garrison at the end of Easter week 1916 and a prisoner of war. She later became a Deputy, a councillor and a founder of St. Ultan’s Hospital, where she worked until she was over 80 years of age. There is widespread and cross-party support for the new hospital to be named the Kathleen Lynn children’s hospital in recognition of her important role in delivering medical care for the women and children of Dublin, especially the poor, and for her pioneering vision in setting up and running St. Ultan’s Hospital. There would be no more fitting time to do so than as we celebrate céad bliain since mná na hÉireann finally won the vote. We should consider the proposal in a sincere manner. I cannot see any impediment to the hospital being named the Kathleen Lynn children's hospital and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">I am sharing time with Senator Ruane. I welcome the Minister to the House on this great occasion of celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage in Ireland. Women’s suffrage in Ireland was an important milestone for Irish women to have their rightful say in their country and take their rightful place in public life. It was for the common good. It symbolised the important public role of Irish women rather than the role in the home in which they are exclusively placed by Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, which shamefully and anachronistically elevates that role. It is one of several articles that affect women only and has no place in our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I have been around for more than half the time of women’s suffrage. I want there to be 50:50 representation of women in all forms of public life, as senior managers, CEOs, consultants, professors, politicians, school principals, in laboratories, courts, Parliament and boardrooms. There should be equal representation of women as writers, directors, actors and administrators in the arts, where the Minister has particular responsibilities. We should be able to be wherever we wish, fully participating and contributing our intelligence and talents. All obstacles, visible and invisible, which would limit, curtail, intimidate, undermine or bully us out of our progress and participation in all aspects of public life must be removed. l know the Minister also wants that.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I note that the Minister is supporting an event called "Speak up and call it out" on 21 March to establish a code of conduct for Irish theatre. It seems that such a code of conduct is overdue but its establishment is a welcome acknowledgement that there is a problem in that regard and commitment to addressing it. It is a signal of zero tolerance for unacceptable behaviour in our theatres and the arts. In light of that commitment, can the Minister explain why the report into allegations at the Gate Theatre has not been published in full? That is of particular relevance for the 56 women who came forward in good faith, did what the Minister asked and spoke up, sharing their painful and upsetting stories with the investigation by workplace relations expert, Gaye Cunningham. Ms Cunningham stated that the report describes behaviours rather than specific incidents. The publication of its full contents is not, therefore, legally compromising. As we celebrate 100 years of women’s suffrage, will the Minister commit to the report being published in full? It would be a fitting recognition of the talent wasted and the women who were wronged, undermined, silenced, kept in their place or driven out by unacceptable behaviour.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LynnRuane" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Senator Lynn Ruane<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_354">I echo the comments of Senator Kelleher regarding the Gate Theatre. It goes without saying that women’s suffrage was a defining moment in history for women and society as a whole. The hard-fought battle for the equal right to participate in our nation’s democracy should be celebrated, reflected on and used as a starting point for what should be a steady rate of progression. We are celebrating the starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We are commemorating the Representation of the People Act 1918 which was passed by the British Parliament while Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom. The section relevant to women’s suffrage is section 43, which relates to franchises. It states that a woman who was not subject to any legal incapacity was entitled to be registered as a parliamentary elector for a constituency - other than a university constituency - if she had attained the age of 30 years, and if either she or her husband was on the last day of the qualifying period occupying as owner or tenant any land or premises in the constituency. A woman over the age of 30 who did not own property or was not married to a man who did, or did not have a university degree, would not, therefore, be able to vote. That was not rectified until the Equal Franchise Act 1928, which allowed all women above the age of 21 to vote, regardless of property ownership. Prior to that, poor, young, uneducated or unmarried women had been excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> When we reflect on how much has been achieved over the past 100 years in respect of gender equality, it is striking how the current challenges to gender equality reflect the exclusions of the 1918 Act. Today, women still feel that exclusion. Historical, cultural and societal norms have ingrained in Ireland’s people the definition of what it means to be a woman. As stated in one of my favourite books, <i>The Spirit Level</i>, equality benefits us all. Why is that the case? Why is gender equality so important? Why have we not moved more towards a level of equality that is reflective of the diverse Ireland in which we live? Just as I would have been excluded in 1918 from having a say in regard to my country, I believe that true democracy will be achieved not when we reach 50:50 representation in the Houses of Oireachtas but, rather, when we have equal participation in every sector of Irish society. We all may be equal in terms of being able to vote at the age of 18 but we have much to do in respect of creating the conditions whereby people from all walks of life use that vote and know they have the opportunity to be decision makers in their own communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Many women in communities in Ireland still feel the impact of the gender bias and sexism that is so embedded in cultures, economic life and many Irish institutions. Women and girls feel disenfranchised on a daily basis and still experience discrimination, gender violence, abuse and active exclusion from participation in many areas of Irish life. This, in turn, not only prevents women from being decision makers but from participating in voting, which is the most basic of democratic rights. When we look to 50:50 gender representation, we must consider those who make up that representation. We must create the space for women to feel included, empowered and valued in public life and we must have vibrant and diverse workplaces that are a picture of equal representation and embrace people of all ethnicities, races and backgrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Women also play a huge role in creating sustainable communities and societies and a sustainable planet. Gender equality is a key factor in sustainable development and forms the basis of sustainable development goal 5, to which Ireland signed up and contributed to the drafting of. The empowerment and support of women and how that relates to sustainable development is of great importance. I recently read a collection of essays entitled <i>Why Women Will Save the Planet</i> in which it is argued that interconnections between women’s empowerment and sustainability must be fully reflected not only in programmes on the ground but also within our own organisations by working across sectors and disciplines.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I wish to finish by quoting Dorothy Day. I do not often quote Catholic social drivers but she has plenty of good quotes to reference. She wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_360">People say, what is the sense of our small efforts? They cannot see that we must lay one brick at a time, take one step at a time. A pebble cast into a pond causes ripples that spread in all directions. Each one of our thoughts, words and deeds is like that. No one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless. There is too much work to do.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_361">I warmly welcome the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to the House and acknowledge the enormous amount of work she has done and her contribution to the Vótáil 100 celebrations, which I will later address. As I was coming to the House today, it struck me that it is hard to believe that 1918 was the first time for Irish women to be permitted by law to vote and stand in parliamentary elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Those 100 years tell us something of the journey we have had. 1918 was also the year in which the first woman was elected to the British Parliament at Westminster, Countess Markievicz who represented a Dublin constituency. She never took her seat in Westminster, instead she joined the revolutionary First Dáil to become the first female Deputy. To mark the centenary, the Houses of the Oireachtas are hosting a programme of events that will highlight the history of the suffrage movement, its leaders in Ireland and their impact on wider voting rights. I acknowledge the work particularly of Senator Ivana Bacik and all the team involved in the preparations and plans for the Vótáil 100 programme. It is an imaginative and collaborative piece of work and an amazing programme, and I wish it success.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I take this opportunity to salute the women in local government, in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, and in government and acknowledge the enormous work they have done. As someone who played a major role in local government for many years, I realised from very early on coming into politics that the female candidates who competed with male candidates in my own neck of the woods certainly had a harder job. When I got to speak to them they told of the difficulties of getting through selection conventions and of then getting elected, but once they were elected and had a mandate and a platform, they excelled. They got that opportunity and were there to do the work. That is an important point. However, there were many women who never got that opportunity. </p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I do not want to let this opportunity pass without mentioning the Magdalen women, to whom Senator Conway-Walsh referred. It is important we remember them. Among that group there were many bright, able ambitious women. There were people who had dreams, expectations and a desire to make a contribution to our society. They, for whatever reason, were judged, many of them were condemned, many were denied an opportunity to be authentic, to realise their potential and play a role in their communities because many of them were driven out of their communities, particularly in rural communities, and had to come to this city to hide their secrets, or as some would say, their shame. They carried that to the end. </p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I met a woman on a train in Charing Cross station in London a few months ago and I had previously met her in the late 1960s. She told me she had left this country from Dún Laoghaire Port with her child. She was not prepared to give up her child and she left. At that time she was a nurse studying in Dublin. She said: "I never could come back. I felt ashamed. I felt dirty. My own family deserted me." She had potential and wanted to do everything she could but had no choice. She said that in the end she was rewarded because she held on to her son and watched him grow up, and that was important to her. It was never men who paid the price. Very many women who wanted to keep their children, which was their given and absolute right, were forced out of this country. Of course, it is right that they should have been able to do that. When we talk about women and our history, we have to remember and question what happened then. </p>
          <p eId="para_366"> However, there are other things happening today, to which we turn a blind eye. Why do we see so many young children on our streets homeless? Why do we see so many young vulnerable girls? What are we doing about it now? What have we learned from the past? That is an important point.<i>
						</i></p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I met a girl outside the gates of Leinster House today who was coming in here on a tour. She told me she is 16 years old and that she would love to be in politics. I asked her what was stopping her. I told her I was glad she was here today and that hopefully she would learn something about our Parliament and the Houses of the Oireachtas. Why are we not giving young women and men, who are citizens, a vote at 16 years of age? It was for a long time a great policy objective of Fine Gael. Young Fine Gael people came to me a year ago and told me they expected Fine Gael to pursue the 16 year old voting age objective. I leave that suggestion with all the parties here. Why are we not championing the right of young women and men to engage and to vote? We sought votes for women but why would we not have young women and men of 16 years of age engaged in politics? Why would we not be brave and courageous enough now in the lead up the next local elections to allow our young 16 and 17 year olds at least to first step into the process of local government and allow them vote in the local elections? That is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> While many women never accomplished the great heights of Countess Markievicz or of the women who are Members of the Seanad or the Dáil or those who are in government, there are women throughout our community and country who are wonderful advocates for social change. They are champions for their communities, their families and for rights. I was a member of St. Patrick's juvenile detention centre visiting committee for many years. I was struck by the fact that I always saw women at the door talking about their sons who were detained there. I rarely came across a man there. I acknowledge the great work of a group of women involved in the Quakers, the Society of Friends, who set up a link service. The support service for women was located in a prefab outside that prison to facilitate women who wanted to champion the cause of penal reform in terms of fair rights and justice for their sons. That is an important aspect. It is also important to acknowledge the power of women and the powerfulness of their engagement in advocacy that history has taught us.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I congratulate all the people involved here, particularly the women and those who spoke here today, on their great achievements. The work is not done yet, they need to keep going. I wish the very best of luck to all involved and thank them for organising the Vótáil 100 programme.</p>

          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_370">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to the House and thank her for all the fine work she is putting into the Vótáil 100 programme. I also compliment all our senatorial colleagues, and especially Senator Ivana Bacik, as the chairperson of the committee. Many worthwhile projects have been put together to date. I recently attended a seminar in the Royal Irish Academy, at which there were students from a school in Limerick who had submitted a project related to Vótáil 100 and women to the young scientist exhibition. The facts and figures they had come up with were interesting. During the past 100 years 1,179 males and 114 females have been elected to Dáil Éireann and there have been 801 males and 99 females in the Seanad, with the females making up 11% of that membership of the Seanad and 9% of that membership of the Dáil. The percentages for female Members is quite low.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The first advocacy for votes for women started in 1847. The Belfast Ladies' Institute was founded in 1846. The Representation of the People Act came into effect on 6 February 1918, which made it legal for women to run for election. Prior to that, the Local Government Act of 1898 allowed females to run for and vote in local elections but not to do so for elections to the Dáil. There was the militant and non-militant campaign that was started, leading up to the granting of the vote in 1918. </p>
          <p eId="para_372"> It is important that we encourage and support females to engage in politics. When I ran for the council elections in 1999, of the 70 candidates, there were only six females and three of them were elected. For 15 of the 17 years I served on my local council, of the 21 councillors, only three were female and when we moved from that number to having a council comprising 40 councillors, only six were female. Therefore, the female representation is quite low. Senator Maura Hopkins alluded to it possibly being related to people having young families and finding it hard to get support. </p>
          <p eId="para_373">It is very important that we, as females, support and help one another. In any walk of life, work and coming up with ideas is a collaborative effort. People often view bouncing ideas off one another as supportive, which is most important. </p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I want to speak about Anna and Thomas Haslam who started the Dublin Women's Suffrage Association that later become the Irish women's association. They were a very inspirational couple who started the idea of suffrage and encouraged people to get involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The Minister has only recently been appointed and I congratulate her for hitting the ground running and getting in touch with her brief. She has given her all to the centenary celebrations and become heavily involved. She has taken a very keen interest in everything that is taking place. There are many national and local events. I encourage as many colleagues as possible to hold events in their own constituencies because an awful lot of people are not aware of suffrage and what people went through to secure votes for females. They are not aware of the important fact that before women won the vote they could not own land or go to university, and people were prevented from becoming doctors or nurses. In addition, despite the achievement of limited women's suffrage, women could not own land until legislation was introduced in 1970. There are many things that we need to highlight, in particular the suffrage that females have gone through. It is great to see so many females in positions of high office and CEOs of companies. Females are to the fore in many spheres but we still need to encourage females to stand for election and provide support. </p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Finally, I wish to pay a compliment to the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, now EU Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, for introducing gender quotas. The measure was introduced by a Fine Gael Government. In 2012, we brought in the requirement for political parties to select 30% female candidates, which will apply for the next general election but will increase to 40% for the subsequent general election. A gender quota is a great incentive and lends support. </p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_377">I am delighted to have the pleasure of welcoming the Minister to the House. I have had the pleasure of working with her in the past, as a woman lawyer, and I have shared platforms with her in that capacity. I am delighted to see her here in her new role as Minister. This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome her on the floor of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> I thank the Minister for spearheading the Government's programme to commemorate the centenary of women's suffrage. I also thank the Leader for facilitating this debate in the House on the centenary of women's suffrage. I thank him for giving us an opportunity to speak about the programme of events that the Oireachtas is organising under the heading of Vótáil 100. I have the pleasure and privilege of chairing the committee. I want to thank all of my colleagues for their kind remarks about the work of the committee. In particular, I thank my colleagues who are on the committee, Senators McFadden, Conway-Walsh and Higgins, and Deputies Catherine Martin and Fiona O'Loughlin. We have received huge cross-party support for the Vótáil 100 programme from colleagues in both Houses. I shall say a little more about the programme we have embarked upon in a moment. I am sure everyone will have seen the new badges to mark the centenary, which are based on the badges produced by the Irish Women's Franchise League. Everyone will receive a copy of the booklet that gives details on the programme of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> As well as discussing the events that we are organising, I want to say a little more about the broader context for the commemoration of the centenary of suffrage, and others have spoke of this aspect too. For those who campaigned more than 100 years ago for women to have the right to vote, the vote was not an end in itself but a means to an end. The greater cause was to secure greater equality in society, which went beyond the right to vote and included such issues as sexual and reproductive health, equality in the workplace and freedom in one's personal life. I am confident that the women suffragettes that we are celebrating this year, like Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Constance Markievicz and others, would campaign alongside all of us on the Waking the Feminists campaign and the #MeToo movement, would challenge the gender pay gap, seek to achieve greater equality in the workplace and would campaign for reproductive health and so much more. It is worth remaking on those campaigns during this significant year for women's rights in Ireland, particularly as we embark on the forthcoming referendum campaign. As many of us said during the Order of Business this morning, we welcome the Supreme Court judgment handed down this morning. It gives us the necessary legal clarity to speedily bring forward the referendum legislation so that we can hold the referendum before the end of May this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I shall now speak about women's rights in a general context. Progress has been very slow on this issue over most of the past century. Despite the achievement of limited women's suffrage in 1918, it took another 60 years, after the appointment of Markievicz as the first woman Minister in an Irish Government, before Máire Geoghegan-Quinn was appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht in the late 1970s. Change has always been hard fought and hard won in the context of women's rights. We should not forget that as we celebrate the centenary of women's suffrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I shall speak briefly about the Vótáil 100 programme. As colleagues will be aware, the programme not only seeks to celebrate the achievements of women as Members of the Oireachtas and to celebrate individual women like Markievicz, it also seeks to highlight the lack of representation of women in politics today. Other colleagues have spoken about this matter, as has the Minister. Despite a very welcome increase since 2016, only 22% of Deputies are women and 30% of Senators are women, or 18 Senators are women out of a total number of 60 Senators. That number is still too low. Clearly, even with the gender quota rising to 40% in the election after next, change will only come about very slowly. We need to do more to encourage more women to enter politics and remove existing obstacles.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> In 2009, I authored a report for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. My report considered women's representation in politics and identified five barriers which have now become known as the five "Cs" that women encounter and impede their progress in politics. The five "Cs" are: lack of cash; lack of confidence; access to child care; culture; and candidate selection procedures. I know that women colleagues will recognise all of those "Cs". We have addressed the fifth "C" through the very welcome legislation that was introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, following pushing by his Labour Party colleagues in government. I remind my Fine Gael friends that a gender quota was initially a Labour Party policy. The policy was embraced on a cross-party basis by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in 2009 and was finally introduced in 2012. The policy has been effective as the number of women elected to the Dáil has increased from 13% in 2011 to 22% in 2016, but female representation is still far too low and we need to make greater strides.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The programme of events for Vótáil 100 will highlight the lack of representation by women. It will seek to increase public awareness of the need for more women to come forward, and will do so through a series of events to mark the centenary. On 1 February, Vótáil 100 hosted a conference at the Royal Irish Academy, as others have mentioned. Yesterday, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn gave a wonderful lecture as Gaeilge to mark Seachtain na Gaeilge, International Women's Week and the Centenary of Women's Suffrage. Tomorrow, a portrait of all of the current women Members of the Oireachtas by artist Noel Murphy will be officially unveiled at 2 o'clock. All women Members have been invited to attend the occasion. The painting will hang in Leinster House on public display just like the photograph of the Oireachtas women who attended the 90th anniversary in 2008. </p>
          <p eId="para_384"> As Members have mentioned, we will have Díospóireacht na nÓg, which is a great all-island school competition on public speaking. The 16 finalists from those schools will speak here in the Seanad Chamber on 17 April. I know many Seanad colleagues will be present for such an historic occasion. </p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Vótáil 100 will run an exhibition, in conjunction with the National Museum of Ireland, in Leinster House from June until September. We will conduct other events for Culture Night in September and we will participate in the Open House Dublin weekend event later in the year. We will also travel to Westminster to present the House of Commons with a portrait of Constance Markievicz to mark the fact that she was not only our first Deputy but also the first woman Member of Parliament to be elected to the House of Commons.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Let us consider the historical context for Markievicz's election, in particular the Representation of the People Act 1918. Many decades of extensive work went into the achievement of what was, in 1918, only a limited right to women's suffrage. </p>
          <p eId="para_387">Back in 1872, Isabella Tod established the first suffrage group in Ireland in Belfast. In 1876, the Haslams established the Dublin Women's Suffrage Association and in 1908, along with Margaret Cousins from Boyle in County Roscommon, Hanna and Francis Sheehy-Skeffingon set up the Irish Women’s Franchise League so we see a range of different women and men - there were, of course, male supporters - fighting for the cause of suffrage over many decades long before it was finally achieved in 1918. The Representation of the People Act 1918, the centenary of which we marked in February, was then succeeded by the Parliament (Qualification of Women Act) in December 1918 that allowed women to stand for the general election. We should remember that while Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected, she was not the only woman to stand for election because Winifred Carney stood in Belfast but was unsuccessful. The achievement of the vote was only one part of the campaign on which so many of these women embarked at the time. They were also very engaged in other campaigns. We think of women like Louie Bennett who was a founding member of the Irish Women Workers' Union and who campaigned for workers' rights alongside the right to suffrage and Constance Markievicz herself who campaigned for workers' and union rights as well suffrage. </p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Moving to contemporary resonances, there are a number of things we should be pushing forward this year to really recognise the memory and work of those women. Those campaigns include not only the campaign to increase the number of women in Parliament but campaigns around the gender pay gap bringing forward the gender pay legislation we started in this House; extension of paternity leave and child care provision in Ireland; moving to tackle online abuse, which is a real issue for many women looking to enter politics; family-friendly working hours in parliaments; and a referendum to delete the place of women in the current very limited recognition of women and mothers in the Constitution and replace it with a gender-neutral provision recognising carers alongside what I hope will be a successful campaign to repeal the eighth amendment. I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that one significant symbolic gesture would be to name the hospital in honour of Dr. Kathleen Lynn, that remarkable woman who did so much for the cause of suffrage and the cause of women and children's rights and who really encapsulated that idea of the broader-based campaigning that marks so many of the suffrage campaigns at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I will finish by saying we need to celebrate the immense contribution of women to public life in Ireland, contributions like those of Constance Markievicz, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and so many more unsung heroes and heroines of the women's movement. There is a lovely quote from Constance Markievicz that is very famous where she exhorted young women in the lead up to the suffrage campaign not to trust to their feminine charms or the problematic chivalry of the men they might meet on the way but rather to dress suitably in short skirts and strong boots, leave their jewels and gold wands in the bank and buy a revolver. We might - perhaps not literally - take heart from her words on the need to continue to campaign on women's rights over this important centenary year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GabrielleMcFadden" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Senator Gabrielle McFadden<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">On 19 March 1911, the first International Women's Day event took place. One of the key themes of the early years of International Women's Day was the campaign for women's suffrage. In 1918, the Representation of the People Act gave some women in Ireland the right to vote and we celebrate that centenary this year. Equally significantly, in 1918, women were for the first time allowed to stand for election on an equal footing with men. Women had to wait a few more years, however, for the enactment of the Constitution of the Irish Free State 1922 to get full and equal voting rights. It is fair to say that despite considerable progress over the past century, the voting booth is one of the few places where women have equality. A friend of mine often jokes that women who aspire to be equal to men lack ambition but that is easy for him to say because he is a middle-class, middle-aged, white settled man so he has never been at the sharp end of inequality. </p>
          <p eId="para_391"> The World Economic Forum global gender gap report benchmarks 144 countries on their progress towards gender parity across a number of dimensions. There is no country in the world where women have achieved parity with men. When we look at Ireland, our results are mixed. In the area of educational attainment, there is parity between the genders and Ireland rates number one of the 144 countries in the comparison. Indeed in the area of participation in third level education, women fare considerably better than men. The health and survival index shows only a small gap is yet to be made up by women. However, it is when we look at the economic participation and opportunity index that we see a very significant gap opening up and we rank 65th in the world. For example, the average Irish woman worked from the 11 November last year until the end of the year for free by comparison to her male colleagues. On an overall basis, the World Economic Forum calculates that at the current rate of progress, pay parity is only 217 years away. </p>
          <p eId="para_392"> It is when we look at the political empowerment index that we see the biggest gap of all, both worldwide and here at home. While the number of women elected to the Oireachtas has improved, there is still a very long way to go before we achieve parity. In the 2016 general election, 123 men were elected to the Dáil. In the entire 100 years since women gained the right to stand for election, there have been only 114 women Deputies so there were more men elected to the Dail in the last election than there have been women Deputies. In the history of the Seanad, only 99 out of 900 women were elected. If we go back to 2009 when I was first elected to Westmeath County Council, I was one of two women out of 23. I am the first ever female Government Chief Whip in the Seanad. So while those pioneering suffragists in 1918 may have won the right to vote and the right to stand for election, 100 years on, the political field is still far from level and it would have been worse had it not been for gender quotas. On the subject of quotas, I firmly believe that the people should get jobs on the basis of ability. However, if Members of the Oireachtas got jobs based on merit alone, we would have 79 women Deputies and 30 women Senators today so there are obviously other factors at play.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Real equality can only be achieved by women and men sharing power with each as decision makers and gradually having more men supporting the give and take of gender equality. I do not see this as battle of the sexes where women gain and men must lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> In fact, the statistics would suggest the opposite. They clearly show that gender equality is good for men. For example, those countries that are most gender equal are also the ones which score highest on happiness scales. The more gender equal that companies are, the better it is for their workers, the happier their labour force is and the more profitable they are likely to be. The more egalitarian our personal relationships are, the happier and healthier both partners are and, therefore, the happier and healthier their children are so gender equality is not a zero-sum game but a win-win scenario. Gender equality is in the interests of countries, in the interests of companies, in the interests of women and in the interests of men. </p>

        <speech by="#GerardPCraughwell" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_395">The Minister of State is very welcome to the House. As she is my local Deputy, I congratulate her. It is the first time I have had the opportunity to do so since she was elevated to the post of Minister of State. The very fact that she is sitting here is testament to the fact that we are moving, albeit very slowly, to where we should be. As I look around this room, I wonder where my male colleagues are. There are not too many of them here. It reminds me of the day we introduced the Gender Recognition Bill. They literally climbed over one another to get out of the room before the discussion started. Clearly, there are some things men are not supposed to be involved in. As I look around, some of the most powerful women in Irish society are sitting around me. For as long as I can remember, one of them, Senator Bacik, has been an advocate for women and women's rights. I see Senator Higgins, who, again, is noted along with Senators Ruane and Kelleher. I could go on and name them all, including Senator McFadden, who is the Government Chief Whip, and my colleague from Carlow. They are all powerful women. The Acting Chairman, Senator Noone, took on one of the most difficult roles this country has had to face in a long time when she took over as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution so there are very powerful women here and I am deeply proud to know all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I fundamentally disagree with quotas. I always and ever did. I do not believe that in a perfect world we should have to have quotas. I have never seen women as needing to be equal. I grew up in a family of 11 and eight of them were girls. However, the woman I want to remember today is one of the strongest women I have ever known in my life. She epitomises the women of Ireland. The woman I am talking about is my mother, Maureen Craughwell. </p>
          <p eId="para_397"> My mother, despite the fact she was the mother of 11 children, always found time to be with me at the most important times of my life. She was with me when I was invested into the Boy Scouts, when I was passing out in the Army on both occasions, when I took my degree and when I took my postgraduate degree. All through my life my father was held supreme in the family. It was "Dad" this and "Dad" the other. Just before my mother died, I was driving to Galway to see her. Suddenly, all of the memories came back of where she was when I needed her. She was always there.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> I am thankful to God that I got the opportunity to say to her before she died that she was the greatest influence in my life. My mother is just one of the thousands and millions of mothers around Ireland who do the same job every single day. It is the mothers of Ireland who give the girls of Ireland the courage to stand up and become the Senators who are in this House today or the Deputies down in the other House. </p>
          <p eId="para_399"> It is the mothers of Ireland who instill in their children the courage to get up and be the best they can. One hundred years on we should not be talking about suffrage. We should be looking at a Seanad that has 30 women and 30 men. We should be looking at a Dáil that is split down the middle. We should be looking at the distribution of power. It is happening slowly. Thankfully, Ms Patricia King in the trade union movement is the leader of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and Sheila Nunan is the leader of the Irish National Teachers Organisation. Women are slowly making their way in Irish society to where they deserve to be. </p>
          <p eId="para_400"> However, there is a requirement, and it falls back to labour, to make rules or regulations that make it easy for women to aspire to or make their way into important roles. I refer to the example of my own trade union, prior to my entry into this House. We held meetings on a Friday in Dublin and they went on until five, six or seven in the evening. It became impossible for women. I remember we had one single mother on the executive committee. She had two young daughters. She had to get home. Ultimately, she had to resign from that. </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> We have to be able to move meetings around the country so mothers are close to home if they need to be. I do not see any reason why the fathers should not be at home. We have to start finding ways of facilitating people. Every time I have visitors in this House, I bring them to that picture down the hall that shows all of the living female politicians. I think it was taken in 1998.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">I am very happy to salute my women colleagues on this 100th anniversary of voting rights for women. I am equally happy, and it is very significant in the context, to welcome my good friend the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to the House. I congratulate her on her appointment and how proactive and effective she has been since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The fundamental thing that merits saying at the outset is that all interpersonal relationships should be based on mutual respect and equality. If that is the case, they are mutually enhancing relationships. Whether they are relationships between the sexes or relationships in any context, it is mutually enhancing where there is respect and equality. There have been many achievements for women down the years and we should salute and recognise the agencies involved in those achievements. </p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The European Union has been a reforming force for women. It has brought in legislative imperatives to the domestic Legislature that have greatly enhanced the role of women. We should salute the EU in that context, recognise it and feel especial loyalty to it, particularly in the Brexit context for that very reason. The Irish Judiciary - and the Minister, Senator Bacik and Senator Noone will be conscious of this, among others - has been a reforming force for Irish women. In its rulings down through the years it has advanced the cause of women and led the Oireachtas and society in this sphere. We should recognise the Judiciary, another arm of government, for that. The trade union movement, as was cited earlier, has also been a wonderful force for equality. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> As a rural representative, I would like to salute a body that has not been mentioned today but had an extraordinarily significant effect in this area. I remember this from my childhood. I refer to the influence of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, on the liberation, self-enhancement, personal development and empowerment of country women in isolated locations, and otherwise, right across this country. The role of the ICA can not be underestimated. We should salute its leadership and its members down the years. </p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I am proud to be a member of the Council of Europe. I am on that body with very distinguished Members of this House, including my great friend Senator Maura Hopkins, Senator Colette Kelleher, Senator Rónán Mullen and Senator Paul Gavan, who is soon to be a member. Senator Higgins played an extraordinary proactive leadership role in the Council of Europe previously. It is a major agent for equality and gender equality specifically. </p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I am proud to be a member of a party that brought in gender quotas and tried to break the glass ceiling. That has clearly been effective. It will be incremental because in the future the numbers will go up. Today, it is not right that any speaker should sit down without recognising the dark sphere of our relationships in the past. That is the mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries. They represent a dark chapter that cannot be avoided in our discourse. In any kind of a redemptive or restorative process we can not ignore them. </p>
          <p eId="para_412"> The way to salute them is to respect and actively support single mothers, women in difficult pregnancies and women in dysfunctional families. If we support those women now who are vulnerable, on the edge and on the periphery, we honour and, in some way, redeem ourselves from what happened in that dark chapter with the Magdalen laundries. We are true to the values we should extol. </p>
          <p eId="para_413"> It is true and a point well made by Senator McFadden that apart from the efficacy of women's equal participation and women's rights, mutual regard of women in society, and indeed parity of relationships, also has benefits for our economy, the well-being of society, for social order, good governance, and for a peaceful, proactive and successful society. I gather my time is up.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I congratulate the Minister on her appointment. As the spokesperson for the arts in Sinn Féin, I look forward to working with her. On that point, I received an email from a member of these Houses yesterday that said "spokesman". If we could do one thing today, please do not be too specific in how we identify the roles of spokespeople. There is no point in calling oneself a spokesman if that implies to a young girl that role is meant for a man.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> This is a chance to reflect on the gender diversity of our institutions. There are many other things but in under five minutes I will not do much more. As has been mentioned, women's suffrage did not bring about women's equality nor have we achieved equality a century later. </p>
          <p eId="para_419">Marriage equality here did not achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, equality and civil rights in the North did not end sectarianism. As we consider the next steps for gender equality, one of the most immediate must be the removal of the eighth amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The struggle for equal gender representation in the Oireachtas is ongoing. That under-representation has led to a history of politics being dominated by men and run from a male perspective. Many women in these Houses of the Oireachtas have gone on record noting that they can be a hostile environment. In my short time here I have seen personal examples of Members making throwaway comments and offhand remarks. Perhaps they do not realise the gravity of such remarks, the environment they are contributing to, the presumptions they are making or that they are making the Parliament an unwelcome place. We cannot uphold any level of leadership without getting our own house in order first.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Previous generations of politicians upheld the subjugation of women, be it through the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries or mental institutions. We criminalised women through marginalisation, the denial of basic rights to contraception and so on. We had a rape culture that censored women and denied them security of the law, the police and the courts and sought to suppress the undauntable and resolute who spoke out.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> The former Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has been mentioned a great deal this week. The year after I was born, she decriminalised homosexuality. She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_423">Someone once said that statistics are people - with the tears wiped off. When, in 1993 as minister for justice, I decided to decriminalise homosexuality, I did so because I met people, rather than statistics. Women with the tears unwiped. Mothers of gay sons, terrified that their children might fall foul of a law that characterised their sexuality as against the interests of the State</p>
          <p eId="para_424">It took a woman to understand. It took the mothers of gay sons to make that change. There are parallels there in terms of any chance a raped gay man had of reporting that crime. It is not a discussion for today but the marriage referendum and the repeal of the eighth amendment are intrinsically linked.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I will move on as I am aware that other Civil Engagement Members wish to speak. The struggle for equal representation in the Oireachtas is ongoing. I mentioned the repeal of the eighth amendment. The activists of that movement will march tomorrow evening for International Women's Day. Their demands are simple. They do not want Bunreacht na hÉireann holding any level of agency over their bodies or their lives. I commend their bravery. The suffragettes were described by Rita O'Hare as extraordinary women who came from every class, creed and background, from rural communities and from this city. She said they rejected the confines of class and the comforts of privilege to join a national women's movement - the labour movement. Her description of the suffragettes resonates today and if I could do anything else it would be to plead with the men in my life and the men in our society to join with them and demand their agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister and salute all of my colleagues. I am very proud to be part of the Vótáil 100 committee with Senator McFadden and the chair, Senator Bacik. In the couple of minutes available to me I want to reflect on those women, and some men, who were involved in the suffrage movement and highlight some of their qualities, of which I will highlight four.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> They were persistent. The achievement in terms of the hard-fought winning of the right to vote in 1918 was not a moment but part of a long movement, which was spearheaded in 1898 when women were given the power to run in the local election, and 100 women put themselves forward. It was achieved by the women's franchise leagues, which took place across the country. I refer to women who mobilised within the Irish Women Workers' Union, for example, and who played a key role in the Lock-out in 1913. I refer to women who were involved in the Rising in 1916. Many of those are the same activists who followed through on this issue. A partial right to vote for women over 30 was won in 1918 but women, and the suffragette movement, stayed with it and continued to demand the right to vote. In 1922, the new Irish State granted an equal right to vote to women and men over 21, six years ahead of the United Kingdom. That is something we can be proud of as well, and I am sure we will commemorate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> The women were diverse. Quakers, Presbyterians, Catholics and Protestants from all kinds of class and background were involved in the suffrage movement. They were also involved in many other political movements, in socialism, passivism - the anti-war and anti-conscription movement was strongly led by women - and in the battle for women workers' rights. That was the diversity, and they continued to battle and contribute in a diverse set of ways as Irish society progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I support the calls to name the new children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. My colleague, Mary Strangman, recently launched the plaque to commemorate her.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">I have two final sentences. I want to mention the two other qualities. They fought hard. This right was not granted; it was won. There was breaking of windows as well as the metaphorical breaking of glass ceilings. They would not allow a veneer of normality over a situation of inequality, and we are seeing that same battle today.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Lastly, and I will not talk about the contemporary situation as others have spoken about it, they set no limit to ambition. Eva Gore-Booth, the sister of Constance Markievicz, ran and was successful, and Winnie Carney also ran-----</p>

          <p eId="para_436">The Minister might permit me to quote from a poem by Eva Gore-Booth because she was part of the suffrage movement in the UK at the same time as her sister played such a key role in Ireland. In a poem called Reincarnation, and she was a very good poet, she states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_437">I seek with humble care and toil</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_438">The dreams I left undreamed, the deeds undone,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_439">To sow the seed and break the stubborn soil,</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is an acknowledgement of how much more needed to be done, the fact that the soil that needs to be broken is stubborn and the challenges that remain to be faced. Right now, women in Ireland across all sectors are rising to that challenge.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">It is just that I want to read my statement into the record. I thank everybody for their contributions. Unfortunately, I will not have the time to address the various issues raised and points made, all of which are of benefit to me in the position I am in as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I will take all of those on board and may speak to some Members individually about some of the topics they raised, but I thank them very much for their contributions. It is good to see so many of them here. It is also good to see so many men here as well. There were three contributions from male speakers, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Before I make my statement, I want to acknowledge the men, and Senator Bacik touched on this earlier, who have helped women over the past 100 years. It is not always a case of being anti-men, and it is important that we acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I refer to the progress that has been made in providing equal opportunities for all but as I stated earlier, we have a long way to travel. To this end, the ambitious programme for Government commits to developing a new integrated framework for social inclusion, which will outline measures to help eliminate any persisting discrimination on grounds of gender, age, family status, marital status, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion or membership of the Traveller community. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> We are committed to specifically further empowering women by building on the legislation passed by this House to encourage increased female participation in politics. An updated national women's strategy will further promote women's participation in decision making. We will empower women to ensure that households headed by women are no longer at high risk of poverty. We will take measures to reduce the gender pay gap, increasing investment in child care and reviewing the lower pay of women and gender inequality for senior appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">My colleagues in Cabinet and I are also actively promoting, and some Senators raised it here, increased female representation on State boards to at least 40%. I am pleased to say that the average female representation on the boards of the bodies under the remit of my Department exceeds 50%. We are also promoting wage transparency, a strengthened role of the Low Pay Commission in respect of the gender pay gap and in work poverty, training opportunities for self development and work related skills to assist a return to the labour market and promote entrepreneurship and an increased level of female participation in our Defence Forces, with the goal of doubling the rate from 6% to 12% over five years. </p>
          <p eId="para_448"> In the context of the centenary of this landmark year for women, my Department is keeping close contact with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Vótáil 100 programme. I acknowledge the hard work of the chair, Senator Bacik and all the members of the committee here. It has a monthly programme of activities leading up to commemorating the First Dáil in January 2019. While it is clear that our own national journey failed women for far too long, today, on the eve of International Women's Day, we pay our respect to all those women who flew the flag for women's participation in Irish political life in the years since Independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> In marking the distance we have travelled in more recent years, it is incumbent on us to remember them well, to cherish their contribution and to build on it into the future. We recall once again Countess Markievicz's words, this time spoken in Dáil Éireann in March 1922 on a debate on women's franchise: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_450">This question of votes for women, with the bigger thing, freedom for women and opening of the professions to women, has been one of the things that I have worked for and given my influence and time to procuring all my life whenever I got an opportunity. I have worked in Ireland, I have even worked in England, to help the women to obtain their freedom. I would work for it anywhere, as one of the crying wrongs of the world, that women, because of their sex, should be debarred from any position or any right that their brains entitle them a right to hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Let us not forget those words. Gabhaim buíochas libh go léir.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">I thank the Chair and appreciate that. I begin by addressing the Syrian crisis. I am appalled at the escalation of violence in Syria in recent weeks. The ongoing conflict there has created one of the worse humanitarian crises in modern times. We know approximately 500,000 people have been killed in the conflict and countless numbers maimed. An estimated eight million people have been displaced inside Syria and 4.5 million refugees are beyond the Syrian border.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Sinn Féin has condemned, and continues to condemn, the Turkish and Saudi funding, arming and training of extremist jihadist groups in Syria. We have strongly criticised the United States, Britain, Israel and France's decision to intervene militarily in this war. We also echo the abhorrence of the United Nations at the complete lack of adherence to international law by all sides in this conflict, including the Syrian Government's action against civil protests.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> In recent days, we have seen eastern Ghouta come under sustained bombardment and aid convoys have been unable to reach those who desperately need humanitarian supplies. There is an urgent need for a ceasefire. In recent weeks the Turkish army has also invaded Afrin and carried out sustained military attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians and Kurdish combatants from the Yekîneyên Parastina Gel, YPG, who were successfully fighting Daesh.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> This invasion is a breach of international law and will undoubtedly hamper the fight against Daesh. This should not be a complete surprise given the many questions surrounding Turkey's covert support for radical jihadist groups in Syria. Ireland, as a priority, must assist efforts to end the conflict, persecute those suspected of committing war crimes and tackle the huge humanitarian crisis this brutal conflict continues to cause. We must continue to send aid to Syria and support humanitarian efforts there and in neighbouring countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_466">Turning to Palestine, I want to reiterate Sinn Féin's call for the release of the Palestinian teenager, Ms Ahed Tamimi. She remains in an Israeli military prison while she awaits trial for slapping an Israeli soldier who entered her illegally-occupied village in the West Bank. Ms Tamimi was reacting after her 15 year-old cousin, Mr. Mohammed Tamimi, was shot in the head with a tear gas canister fired by an Israeli soldier. He had emergency surgery to save his life and still needs further surgery to reconstruct his skull. </p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Last week, heavily armed Israeli soldiers broke into his home in the middle of the night and arrested him. He was taken in for interrogation, in just another example of the apartheid Israeli state arresting, detaining and interrogating children. Mr. Tamimi was put under so much pressure in this interrogation that he stated that he was not shot at all but instead fell off his bike. This lie was repeated by the Israeli military command and some within the Government. It shows the extreme lengths the Israeli Government will go to in an attempt to shield its horrific actions, continue its illegal occupation of Palestine and discredit all those who challenge it. Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, condemn Mr. Tamimi's arrest and interrogation? Will he protest it directly with his Israeli counterpart and call for Ms Tamimi's release?</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> War in Yemen has claimed over 10,000 lives and created such devastation that the country is continually on the brink of famine and in desperate need of humanitarian aid. More than 11 million children, nearly every child in Yemen, now needs daily humanitarian assistance. I welcome the Government's response in supporting aid and humanitarian efforts in the country. However, we need to do more to end the conflict. Ireland should support calls to place an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia until it ends its brutal attacks on Yemen and lifts its crippling blockade. </p>
          <p eId="para_469"> We must also look at what is happening at Shannon Airport. In the first six months of 2017, 427 permits were approved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for military-contracted planes to stop off and fly through Irish airspace. We know from the permits that these planes were on their way to Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Is it a coincidence that all these countries are members of the Saudi-led coalition waging a savage war against the Yemeni people?</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I genuinely do not understand how, on the one hand, the Minister can do good work calling for humanitarian aid but, on the other, turn a blind eye to the fact that our airport in Shannon is actively engaged as a forward base in the perpetration of that war against the Yemeni people.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Speaking of Bahrain, is the Minister aware that the Bahraini human rights activist, Nabeel Rajab, was sentenced to five years in prison last week for criticising the Bahraini Government in posts on Twitter in 2015? I am deeply concerned about Nabeel's prosecution and lengthy sentence. It shows that the Bahraini Government will go to severe lengths to crack down on even the smallest amount of free speech. We cannot be seen to tolerate such totalitarianism. All of us must be free to criticise authority and call out injustice when we see it. I call on the Minister to directly protest Nabeel's conviction with his Bahraini counterparts and to publicly speak out in favour of his immediate release.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I will conclude by speaking briefly on the subject of Catalonia. I am concerned that the Spanish Government is continuing to suspend home rule in Catalonia. Ministers in the previous Catalan Government remain in prison or in exile abroad and two Catalan civic society leaders remain in jail, all on serious charges of rebellion and sedition for holding or supporting a democratic referendum on independence. Their continued imprisonment and exile is completely unacceptable and anti-democratic. These prisoners should be released immediately and those in exile allowed to return home.</p>

          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_473">I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister back to the Seanad and to raise a number of issues in the areas of foreign affairs and trade with which my group and my party are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Two weeks ago, the Minister's former Department opened a public consultation on the plans for a new nuclear reactor at the Hinkley Point plant in Somerset in the United Kingdom. I raised the issue of the cross-border impact from such projects at the time and asked that all parties in the Seanad would take an active role in ensuring a strong Irish voice is heard on these issues. Concerns remain about safety, waste and crisis impacts of such facilities, a mere 500 km off our coast. I hope the Minister's Department will continue the long-standing cross-party tradition of tackling successive UK Governments on nuclear policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> On the topic of neutrality, we saw the publication of a policy document last week from all four of his Fine Gael colleagues in the European Parliament that advocates for a radical alteration to the Irish approach to neutrality and a common European defence. That would see Ireland seek to access EU defence fund moneys and increase our involvement in joint military operations. That would be a significant move away from the position as laid out in the 2015 White Paper on Defence and is part of the erosion of the official position on neutrality I believe the average citizen would still assume is official State policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Neutrality matters, not just in the abstract. It is not just a nice idea. It is and has been a long cornerstone of our foreign policy that has allowed us play an outsized and positive role on the international stage, particularly as a member of the United Nations where we were seen as a fair and dispassionate arbiter throughout the Cold War and in its aftermath. Were we to sacrifice that position, we could offer next to nothing to either NATO or the European Union in terms of military capacity yet would be sacrificing much of the serious diplomatic and soft power our world-class diplomats have wielded so effectively since the foundation of our State.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Regarding Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, my colleague, Senator Higgins, previously raised several pertinent questions about the role of Ireland with the new organisational agreement. I join her in urging the Minister to lean in further to Ireland's role as a peace-building nation driven by humanitarianism principles in our foreign affairs policy and to strongly defend our proud record of neutrality. I ask the Minister about the implementation plan for PESCO. Will it be published and will it be brought to these Houses and voted on?</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Regarding procurement, will that be subject to parliamentary review? Will we be setting aside categories of equipment which Ireland will not procure such as drones? Will the Minister assure us that weapons or equipment we help fund will always be used within a UN mandate? I am interested to hear his views on those questions and on the wider area of neutrality in the context of the statements by his colleagues in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> On the issue of trade, there have been other significant developments, with the European Court of Justice finding that investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms in inter-state trade deals are incompatible with EU law. While this is a welcome development in terms of democracy within the EU, it will not affect international agreements between the EU and other states or organisations. This is particularly significant as we approach the next stage of Brexit negotiations, which will take the form of trade negotiations. What model of trade agreement will be pursued and, crucially, will it include an investor-state arbitration method such as investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, or an investment court system?</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> It is clear also that we cannot move forward with full ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with the legality of elements within that awaiting judgment. Can the Minister confirm that the Government will, as appropriate, await the European Court of Justice ruling on the investment court system, ICS, before proceeding further?</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The campaigners from the Bantry Bay kelp forest group were outside Leinster House today protesting and appealing to the Government to review the licensing of such a large area for harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay. In June, the United Nations will convene in New York to discuss a new process for the international management and protection of our seas and oceans, which I expect the Minister will attend. I ask that he might briefly outline the Government's thinking on marine protected areas in an international context, which is especially relevant now in the face of Brexit.</p>

          <from>Senator John O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_482">I am deputising for Senator Joe O'Reilly. I had not intended to speak but I am glad to contribute briefly to the debate and to signal the opportunities and challenges posed by our relationships in Europe and with our colleagues throughout the world. I will not go into the detail of individual issues that have been raised here but whatever criticisms there may be of Irish participation, either in Europe or beyond, it is very important we recognise that as an island nation we cannot be self-sufficient or follow an isolationist economic policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> There are not many positives in terms of Britain's decision to leave the EU but one positive is that results of opinion polls here on the importance of remaining in Europe range from 80% to 90% in favour of remaining. I very much welcome that. One of the weaknesses of the European Union over the years is that it did not connect with ordinary people in the street in the member states. If there is any lesson to be learned from Britain's decision to leave it may be that Europe failed to reform and connect with the individual member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his negotiations on Brexit. We are not certain how all of it will play out but he has played a very important role so far and it is hoped it will end in a situation where Ireland will be a stronger part of Europe and that our future economic viability will not be affected. If the relevance of Europe to the ordinary member states and that connectivity had been assured in the past 40 years since Ireland and Britain joined and it became a larger unit, we might not be facing the current situation with Britain leaving the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> I very much welcome the Government's recent policy to increase our embassy presence across the world and establish new trade with countries outside the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">In the next couple of weeks Ireland will have a unique part to play in spreading its message throughout the world. In recent years, in particular, this has been done to maximum effect. I want the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, Ministers and all others who represent the country abroad to send a very strong message in the coming weeks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesBlack" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_487">I welcome the Tánaiste to the Chamber. I am pleased to see him back in Seanad Éireann. Given the limited time available, I will focus on three specific points. First, as he is aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement recently spent two days in Belfast meeting a number of community groups. Such outreach activity is a vital part of our work in dealing with the remaining legacy issues of the conflict and the visit was really impactful. I was blown away by it. In particular, I was blown away by the testimonies, especially on the Irish language. There are more than 6,000 children in Irish-medium education across Northern Ireland and for many in Belfast, it is such a central part of their identity. This issue is often politicised to the point where it is viewed mainly as a political football or an institutional stumbling block, but that is far removed from the ordinary concerns of those who speak the language daily and care deeply about its development. I was especially stuck by our meetings with Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. I was delighted to speak to these groups that are often forgotten and marginalised. Their focus was on unemployment, housing, mental health and the legacy of the conflict. One could feel their passion for regenerating their communities, which was amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> While the Irish language is often associated with nationalism, the Lower Shankill Community Association actually runs a weekly class. One of the first comments from a participant was that the language should be neutral and belong to everyone and that it was often politicised far beyond that. I saw a real focus on social issues. In that sense the Irish language was not always the biggest priority. That was a huge shock to me also. Many were happy to see such classes being offered and were more concerned with the availability of housing and social and economic opportunities for their children. It really made me see that the political focus, particularly on the language, did not always reflect the reality on the ground. That was an eye-opener. What we hear in media coverage down here does not correspond with what was said at our meetings in east and west Belfast last month and I do not want those marginalised voices to be unheard. Is the Tánaiste willing to meet such groups and provide greater chances for direct engagement? They would love to meet him also. I noted previously my admiration for the fantastic work he is doing on this issue and know that the current situation in the North is something about which he cares deeply, especially in the context of Brexit. Such community engagement could only enhance it.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I wish to touch briefly on the situation in Palestine, about which we have spoken a lot. I welcomed the robust debate we had on the occupied territories Bill which I had tabled in January. I am pleased that the Tánaiste has committed to facilitating the use of Government time to resume the debate before the summer recess. Much of the focus was on our legal capacity to pursue such a policy on settlement goods. I am very happy to work with Oireachtas Members in outlining the strong, coherent legal basis of the legislation. I will be reaching out to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, in particular, as many members have a deep interest in the issue and the Bill, given that in 2012 the committee strongly endorsed a ban on settlement goods. During the debate the Tánaiste noted that his preference was for co-ordinated EU action on settlement expansion, something I would welcome strongly, but he also told the Dáil that there was no reasonable prospect of it happening. I have spoken to him on the issue previously and think it is at this point that we differ - when the question becomes how Ireland should react to gridlock in the European Union. I appreciate and recognise his position on the issue, but I believe we can show leadership on it. It was in that spirit that I tabled the Bill. We can and should be willing to act first if others will not do so in the face of injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> On the point about the European Union, Senator Mark Daly noted in the debate in January that the Tánaiste had made a commitment to raise the issue of settlement expansion at the Foreign Affairs Council last week. I would welcome an update on that point. Was the issue raised and, if so, what was the response of Foreign Ministers?</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I will briefly raise a third matter. Last month the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade produced an extensive review of the Irish Aid programme and made a clear call for "enhanced oversight measures" in multilateral programmes. I am so proud of Ireland's aid work, but we must ensure agreements to which we sign up respect human rights and the humanitarian principles of this country. I am thinking, in particular, of the EU-Turkey deal on migration and the atrocious treatment of refugees fleeing persecution. We need coherence between our aid programme and foreign policy on issues such as this. Given the committee's report, will the Tánaiste agree to increased enhanced oversight of the multilateral system for which it called?</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> I reiterate the questions posed by my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on joint procurement under the PESCO arrangement. How can we be sure nations with which we jointly develop or buy military equipment will not use it outside UN mandated missions? For example, Germany has troops in Afghanistan. </p>
          <p eId="para_493"> I thank the Tánaiste and look forward to hearing his response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NealeRichmond" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Senator Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_494">I welcome the Tánaiste and thank him very much for coming back. Given his brief, I could raise 1 million issues with him, but as I only have five minutes, I will skip Brexit, on which I have 1 million opinions. </p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I commend the Government's commitment to the provision of overseas development aid. I had the genuine privilege of visiting the South Sudanese-Ugandan border with Irish Aid in autumn 2017 where I saw the work being done by our people on the ground and through our agencies. It is testament to the rich history of Ireland in terms of the work of our development agencies and missionaries and something we need to maintain and continue. That responsibility feeds into the general Irish narrative, on which I would like to focus, namely, Ireland's place in the world. I accept that we are a very small nation and that this is a very small island, but the slogan is "An island at the centre of the world". That is a very good and relevant slogan when so many other nations and states are closing themselves off, most notably the United States where the President has made worrying comments about tariffs on steel imports and our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom. Ireland can be the bastion of brightness that believes in an open, tolerant society; that will always welcome people from other countries and that will send its people abroad to work, play, study and give so much to the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> On the Irish global footprint, I have a few questions for the Tánaiste about the Department's strategy when it comes to increasing our diplomatic footprint throughout the world in the context of the Ireland House concept in bringing together not just our diplomatic and consular efforts but also the efforts of agencies such as Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, Irish Aid and so many others, to show that what Ireland can bring to the global stage is a very strong and powerful tool, not just to get our message out but also to sell Ireland to bring people and businesses here and support Irish people, businesses and entities working and operating abroad. I very much welcome the announcement made by the Tánaiste before Christmas on an increased diplomatic footprint through the opening of five new embassies and consulates. Will he indicate which is next?</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I welcome the prioritisation of New Zealand, but there is so much more we could do to strengthen existing embassies both within and beyond the European Union. However, there is also a lot more we could do to strengthen our consular footprint beyond embassies. There is huge scope in that regard in the United Kingdom. The embassy in London is one of the busiest, if not the busiest, of our embassies. Last May I visited the consulate in Edinburgh and it is doing excellent work with the Irish diaspora and also in promoting increased engagement between Ireland and Scotland, economically and educationally. That work is reciprocated here by the very strong Scottish office. Is there scope to look at the northern English powerhouse which is supported by the United Kingdom Government? For want of a much better word, could we devolve some of the responsibilities from the embassy in London and consider having a new operation in Manchester, Liverpool or Leeds to focus on the north of England and, in turn, consider an administration in Cardiff and also in the midlands where historically there has been a very strong Irish population in places such as Coventry, Birmingham but which are also places to which Irish businesses are increasingly going? As the United Kingdom, regrettably, leaves the European Union, we must be sure we will maintain the closest possible relations through our EU membership but also through our existing diplomatic relationship which is as strong now as it has ever been, as highlighted by the various state visits.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I commend the Tánaiste, his Department and Ministers of State on all the work that is being done. Many thousands of Irish people are working through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in very difficult situations. The role our diplomats, peacekeepers and aid agencies play abroad shows Ireland in the best possible light. We have an opportunity now to double, triple or quadruple that impact, and that could benefit our small country in very many ways.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">As there are no more speakers, I call the Minister to respond to the debate. He has, in accordance with what has been laid down, eight minutes but, in essence, we have 30 minutes remaining, although I am not asking him to take all that time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_500">I will certainly take more than eight minutes to answer some of the questions that were raised today. First, I take this opportunity to address the Seanad on matters relating to foreign affairs to wrap up on the debate that took place on 6 February. Unfortunately, I was not able to be here, but the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, was here in my place. I would like to make some remarks on the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, as I am aware that issue dominated the debate on 6 February. I would like to address some of the issues that were raised today and the previous day. As the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, outlined, Ireland joined PESCO because it is in our interests to do so. Participation adds value to the work of the Defence Forces serving in peacekeeping operations in particular. It also keeps our troops safer. Our Defence Forces participate in multilateral missions in service of international peace and security in what can often be very challenging environments. It makes sense that they train together and work efficiently with their partners, and PESCO will help that.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Participation in PESCO is voluntary and decided on a project-by-project basis. The kinds of projects we are interested in reflect Irish foreign policy priorities. They include, for example, co-operation on counterterrorism and cybersecurity, a centre of excellence for EU training missions, disaster relief, and harbour and maritime surveillance and protection, which I suspect Senator Grace O'Sullivan would be very interested in given her commitment to the marine.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> PESCO is also seen at EU level as a political demonstration of unity and inclusivity in<b>
						</b>the face of Brexit, the continuing EU ambition to provide global leadership in support of the multilateral system, and to foster regional peace and stability. PESCO fully respects the differing security and defence policies of EU member states. The Council decision establishing PESCO specifically states that "the decision of Member States to participate in PESCO is voluntary and does not in itself affect national sovereignty or the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States". Other EU countries which, like Ireland, are not members of any military alliance are also participating in PESCO.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The issue of PESCO, procurement and the triple lock was raised. Under the Defence Acts, the deployment of the Defence Forces overseas on peacekeeping missions requires the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann and the specific mission must be authorised or supported by the United Nations. That is what we term the triple lock. Any capabilities developed or equipment procured under PESCO remain solely and entirely with the member state, and decisions on their deployment remain a decision solely for and by the member state concerned. In Ireland’s case, this will continue to be governed by the triple lock. I trust that this will clear up any confusion regarding that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">The Minister asked if his response had addressed the question. The key question was with respect to joint procurement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_219" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_507">We will have to pick and choose the areas if there is joint procurement in terms of trying to get value for money. We have, for example, a memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom on defence, and procurement is one of the areas on which we work with it, but that does not mean we procure inappropriately or with respect to weaponry that is inappropriate in terms of what Ireland aspires to do from a peacekeeping and defence perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The establishment of PESCO is just one aspect of the implementation of the EU's global strategy. Another is the integrated approach which aims to enhance the EU's international crisis management capabilities through using all of the Union's policies and instruments, including diplomatic, development co-operation and humanitarian aid tools.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> Our core foreign policy approach and priorities remain. Our long-standing policy of military neutrality is valued by this Government and will be upheld. This policy of military neutrality has gone hand in hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhance co-operation and reduce conflict around the world. In other words, military neutrality for us does not mean non-engagement or leaving somebody else to do the difficult things. We have a very active policy of neutrality where Ireland chooses on a voluntary basis to get involved in multiple, very complex and, in some cases, very difficult peacekeeping missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Support for multilateralism and the UN is another aspect of the EU's global strategy, and Ireland will continue to champion this. PESCO has the potential to strengthen and enhance the international peacekeeping efforts of our Defence Forces in support of the UN. The UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping has welcomed PESCO as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN-mandated operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> The UN is the cornerstone of the multilateral rules-based order, and it is facing particular challenges at present, as referred to by Senator Richmond. We believe Ireland should contribute to and participate to the fullest extent possible in the work of the UN, which is why our candidature for a seat on the UN Security Council is a reflection of the centrality of the UN to our foreign policy ambitions. A seat on the UN Security Council would serve as a platform to amplify the projection of Ireland's values and priorities on international relations. PESCO in no way compromises these values. We are continuing our leadership on disarmament and non-proliferation, the promotion and protection of human rights, humanitarian intervention, sustainable development, conflict resolution and the pursuit of a fairer, more just and more secure world.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Several Senators raised their concerns about Brexit during the debate in February. The Government welcomed the publication of the draft withdrawal agreement by the European Commission last week, including the proposed protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The protocol, a part of the withdrawal agreement, translates into legally binding terms the firm commitments made in December. The draft withdrawal agreement will now be discussed internally among EU member states and will then be discussed with the UK via the task force in the Article 50 negotiations. We hope that it will be possible for substantive engagement to begin as soon as possible. The European Council was clear in December that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken in phase one are respected in full in legal terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> We have always been clear that our preference is to avoid a hard border through a wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK, and this is a view shared by the UK Government. We are also committed, however, to exploring specific solutions to be proposed by the UK, if necessary. At the same time, should it prove necessary, there is now a legal provision to implement a backstop if there is no agreement on option A or option B. We are very clear on what that backstop would be and the detail of how it would work.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I welcome Prime Minister May’s reiteration in her speech last Friday of the UK's commitment to protecting the peace process, achieved through the Good Friday Agreement, and to the commitments made in the agreement reached last December, including on avoiding a hard border. She has given a number of important reassurances in her speech, including restating her overall goal of a very close relationship with the EU, but also recognising that the UK will face hard choices given constraints between some of the UK aims and the consequences of withdrawing from the European Union. We look forward to the UK presenting its position officially across the negotiating table in Brussels and considering it together with the Commission and the other EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Ireland is continuing to work closely with our EU partners and the task force to ensure that the commitments made in phase one are delivered in full and that Ireland’s interests are advanced in the EU's position for the negotiations on transitional arrangements and the future relationship. The European Council plans to adopt additional guidelines at its next meeting on 23 March as regards the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Work in support of the negotiations in Brussels is continuing across Departments, co-ordinated by my Department. The solidarity of our EU partners for Ireland has been really impressive and consistent. I will continue to engage regularly with my EU colleagues in the weeks and months ahead on issues of key concern for Ireland as the negotiations progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> While the UK’s decision to leave the EU has serious implications for Ireland, we maintain a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with the UK. We are fully committed to developing and enhancing this relationship over the coming years, despite the challenges that Brexit will undoubtedly pose.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I am aware that several Senators raised issues about the Middle East, including the Middle East peace process, which is a particular priority for me, as I hope this House will understand from previous debates. In recent weeks, I met again with the US team working on the Middle East peace process to explore what we can do both nationally as Ireland and at EU level to make progress on the Israel-Palestine conflict. As I have stated previously, I was disappointed by the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In all my US contacts, I have been clear about Ireland's commitment to a two-state solution with Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and Palestine at some point in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Senator Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill was born from a desire to end settlement construction on Palestinian land. The Government and I share this objective fully. However, the matters touched on in this Bill relate to international trade, which falls under the common commercial policy of the EU. We will return to this issue in the Seanad in a few months and I look forward to that. Ireland does take action on settlements where possible. For example, regarding the matter raised by Senator Feighan, I deplore the demolition of Palestinian structures in Area C and I have seen the consequences having visited the area. Ireland is part of a group of EU states that have called for compensation for the destruction or confiscation of structures and other humanitarian aid, which is contrary to international law. We raised all these issues at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week when we had a number of Arab League foreign Ministers with us for a lunch time discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Senator Ó Donnghaile raised the important issue of the treatment of minors. During my visit in January, I did raise Ireland's concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities. During my visit to the Middle East, I raised the case of Ahed Tamimi. Ireland and other EU diplomats have attended her hearings in the military court. The handling of this case is worrying. The arrest was carried out in the middle of the night with the latter broadcast on Israeli television. She is being held without bail pending trial, which may result in a very long period of detention on the basis that she is a danger to the public. I think this allegation lacks serious credibility but we will continue to monitor that case with interest. </p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Regarding Syria and Turkey and Russia in particular, the situation in Syria is of the utmost concern. I think that in ten, 20 and 50 years time, the world will look back at how history is written regarding Syria and it really will be a stain on the capacity of the global powers to prevent mass bloodshed and misery. The siege of eastern Ghouta has been utterly horrifying. Somebody talking about it in the aftermath of the worst of that violence last week told me that they simply could not watch it. It was just too horrifying to think of the detail, particularly the impact on women and children. I found it difficult to watch myself and I utterly condemn in the strongest possible terms the attacks on civilians that have taken place. I was at the UN Security Council when the Secretary General referred to eastern Ghouta as hell on earth and called for an immediate ceasefire there. Russia's support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people. In October 2017, I relayed Ireland's concerns to the Russian deputy foreign Minister. These messages have also been conveyed to the Russian ambassador on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Regarding the situation in Afrin, which was mentioned earlier, I understand Turkey's desire to protects its citizens from spillover from the conflict. However, military action risks being counterproductive and a de-escalation is undoubtedly needed. Officials from my Department met the Turkish ambassador in January and highlighted Ireland's concerns about the protection of civilians. </p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Regarding Yemen, which is in a similar category to Syria in some ways, I believe the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to conflict. I welcome the appointment of Martin Griffiths as the new UN special envoy for Yemen and wish him well in the almost impossible job he must do. Ireland has provided over €11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015 and we are committed to maintaining that support. Ireland has provided over €20 million in core global funding to UNICEF since 2015. Ireland was part of the core group that secured a landmark resolution at the UN Human Rights Council last September establishing an international group of eminent experts to examine and report back on the human rights situation in Yemen and whether or not war crimes have been committed there. As I stated previously in this House, there is no consensus at present at EU level on an arms embargo to Saudi Arabia or any other members of the coalition but to be clear, Ireland does not export arms to these countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Several Senators addressed development issues, including our 0.7% of gross national income overseas development aid target and the sustainable development goals that are very much linked to that. Preparations are under way to produce a new White Paper on international development policy in 2018. This will inform an ambitious pathway towards making sustainable progress on that 0.7% UN target. What Senator Richmond said earlier is true. This Government has an ambition to dramatically change the ambition levels relating to getting to where we promised we would be, which is 0.7%. That is a discussion that needs to take place between my Department, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Reaching this target will involve significant increases in the overseas development aid budget and careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders because not all of the overseas development aid comes through my Department. Some of it goes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; some of it goes through the Department of Health; and some of it goes through a series of other Departments such as the Department of Education and Skills. When we have clarity on that pathway to the 0.7% target, I would be delighted to come back to the House and talk through it in detail as I would like to get feedback regarding the White Paper we will progress. Clearly, the work of the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in this area and the report it published last week will help to inform what I hope is a non-party and non-partisan debate on how we do that and provide a much more generous approach that I believe Ireland should be taking towards overseas development aid financing. </p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Regarding the national implementation plan for sustainable development goals, the Department of Climate Action, Communications and the Environment is co-ordinating the interdepartmental working group that drafted the plan and will be drafting a voluntary national review. The review will include input from civil society, business groups and individuals. As with the national implementation plan, my Department plays an active supporting role in this process and has responsibility for targets that involve supporting developing countries to achieve their sustainable development goals, including in the key areas mentioned, which are gender, education, climate change and agriculture, where I believe Ireland has international relevance and impact. </p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Senators also raised issues relating to the diaspora and returning emigrants. This day last year, on 7 March, the Government approved, in principle, the holding of a referendum to amend the Constitution to extend the franchise at presidential elections to include Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland. We are committed to holding a referendum on this issue, which is likely to be in June 2019. We are also committed to reducing the barriers faced by citizens seeking to return to Ireland from abroad. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commissioned an economic report on difficulties experienced by Irish people returning home which has recently been finalised and makes 30 recommendations for Government. We are going to publish that report this evening. That is the plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_527">There will be statements in the Dáil on it tomorrow. We are also working to address the recommendations in the report, including through the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad which works to facilitate a whole-of-Government response to issues affecting Irish people abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> This Government also continues to identify with and support the needs of Irish emigrants living in the United States, including undocumented Irish citizens. We remain wholly committed to working with the US authorities to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish, while respecting the right of the United States to set its immigration policies. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has worked closely with Irish immigration centres in the United States for many years on this issue, and continues to fund many centres through the emigrant support programme. These centres provide front-line services to many undocumented communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> In addition to emigrant support programmes, we continue to raise the plight of the undocumented at the highest level, including through my recent visit to Washington. The ongoing work of Deputy John Deasy, who is a special envoy on this issue, is paying dividends. The matter will be raised by the Taoiseach during his St. Patrick's Day visit in the days ahead. Once again, I thank Senators for the opportunity to address some of these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_530"> One or two other points were raised regarding our global footprint. The Taoiseach has outlined an ambition to double our global footprint, that is, Ireland's impact and reach internationally, by 2025, which is a pretty ambitious target. We have started in an ambitious way and this year new embassies will open in Santiago in Chile, Bogotá in Colombia and New Zealand, which should have happened before now. New consulates will open in Vancouver and Mumbai. A new embassy will open in Amman in Jordan, which reflects our interest in the Middle East peace process and how it will develop into the future. </p>
          <p eId="para_531"> We are close to announcing a series of new embassies in other parts of the world where Ireland needs to increase its presence, such as west and north Africa, and east of the European Union. I do not want to start naming names, but there are diplomatic and strategic engagements in which Ireland needs to get involved in parts of the world where we have been light in terms of our presence until now.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The final issue is protecting the marine environment. When I was in a previous Ministry, I committed to Ireland banning microbeads, something about which Senator O'Sullivan feels very strongly and continues to campaign on. We are going to do that. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Murphy, about the matter. We are going through the necessary processes with the Commission to be able to do it, but I am very confident that the required legislation will be passed before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I am also a big supporter of marine protection areas. We will progress special protection areas at sea in the future. We are also the first Government to progress marine spatial planning, which is very much part of the Ireland 2040 plan. Unfortunately, people have chosen to focus on other issues relating to Ireland 2040 in terms of how it is being sold and marketed rather than the detail of what would change Ireland for the better. That is primarily politics rather than anything else. Some mistakes were made, but nothing which would justify the level of criticism and coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The level of ambition around the development of our marine resources in the plan shows a fundamental change in ambition in Government policy which is very welcome. It will not surprise people who know me well to know that I have a real commitment to the marine as a resource which needs to be protected and which can give a lot more to its people than it is currently giving. With those comments, I hope I have addressed most of the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">I am very conscious of the Minister's background. He cares very much about the developing world and has visited many of the places in receipt of overseas development aid from Ireland. Given his background expertise as a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he will know that Gorta-Self Help Africa has called for a new initiative, namely, the creation of an African agri-investment fund of €50 million over the next five years as a pilot to provide loans and access to credit for small and medium African enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Ireland has achieved something in which it is very interested, in that we grew from a largely smallholder farmer base to a leading agri-economy. Of the 1.4 billion people in the world who could be described as extremely poor, 70% live in rural areas in basic subsistence farming situations and need to be connected to markets. Is that something on which the Minister can make a commitment?</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I note the Minister also cares about getting back to 0.7% of GDP for overseas development. We have fallen from 0.58% to 0.32%. We are a First World economy. If the Minister was a betting man, when will we make it to 0.7%?</p>

          <p eId="para_563">I think I answered a pretty broad-ranging group of questions. I dealt with about a dozen different issues. If the Senator has specific questions on the two matters she raised, I said I would come back to her specifically. I cannot be expected to give her an answer when I do not have the details in front of me.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> On Senator Mullen's question on an African agrifood fund, we have such a fund. When I was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine we set one up, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We are putting Irish taxpayers' money into grant aiding Irish food companies to set up locally in Africa, employ local people and build local management capacity. There are a number of examples of companies which have used that finance to set up successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> We initially focused on Kenya, but also looked at Uganda and Ethiopia. We would like to do a lot more of that. The concept around funding agrifood development to help countries make the agricultural progress we have made over the past 50 years within the next ten to 15 years is exactly what Ireland would like to do. When one sees a significant expansion of the Irish Aid programme, one will see a lot of extra money going into education and gender equality issues, in particular the education of girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Additional funding will be also be provided for agriculture and agrifood and the links between development and some of the generational issues we face, particularly on the continent of Africa in areas such as water, food security and rapid population growth. These issues will continue to create severe pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I spoke this morning on the future of Europe. In my view, the big idea for Europe in the area of external global policy should be to establish a new and much more ambitious and structured political relationship with Africa through the African Union. I hope Ireland will be a leader in that debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">I thank Senators who supported the Bill to allow it to proceed to Report Stage. The amendment provides that the Act will come into operation not later than three months after the date of its passing. I have been asked why the amendment is necessary and why a Bill on family reunification is urgent and necessary. We are in the midst of the biggest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. More than 65.5 million human beings have been forcibly displaced as a result of violent conflict, persecution and disaster. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, this is the highest number ever recorded. There are an estimated 2.25 million refugees, more than half of whom are children. Enormous human tragedies are taking place every day, including in eastern Ghouta. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, stated not half an hour ago that he could not watch reports from eastern Ghouta on television, especially what is happening to women and children there. In Yemen, a proxy war is raging and cholera is rampant and we have the tragedy of the Rohingya people who have been displaced from Myanmar. People are living in hell in other places too, far from our awareness and knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The scale of displacement is vast and almost unimaginable in our stable and comfortable lives. Only a tiny proportion of the world's refugees are able to use safe and legal mechanisms to access asylum or international protection. In 2015, more than 1 million people risked their lives to reach Europe by sea, many on dangerously inadequate boats. More than 4,500 people went missing and are feared drowned. Recorded testimonies of more than 250 people travelling to Europe via Libya detailed sexual violence, torture, denial of food and deprivation of medical care.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> While the routes to safety taken by refugees may be diverse, a common thread running through their experiences is the breakdown of the family unit. The destruction of the family unit is an almost universal consequence of refugee experiences according to Brooke Wilmsen who did a study of family separation in the refugee context. When a person reaches safety, finding and reuniting with loved ones is often the priority, as was captured in the recently published Oxfam study, Safe But Not Settled. The human misery, sundered families and scale of the crisis demonstrate the imperative on Ireland, as implied in my amendment, to urgently play its part, now more than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Sadly, since the inception of this legislation, the Government has opposed it at every turn. Two successive Ministers have not listened and have instead sought to block the Bill and even mislead. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, under law, the Government must move forward with the Bill within three months of legislative approval. I ask Senators to show their support for the amendment, which simply seeks to ensure that the International Protection (Family Unification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 is brought into legal effect three months after its legislative approval to ensure a timely response to refugees and family members anxiously wishing to reunite and mend families that have been broken up by cruel circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">The family is regarded in a particular light in this society and we make special provision for it in the Constitution. It is, therefore, a very important element. It is important that we have accurate statements from the Minister. On Second Stage, I queried his statement that the average number of members of family for which applications for reunification were made under the scheme was 20. I do not believe that for one second and an analysis of the figures released by the Department suggests the figure is inaccurate. One application was for more than 70 family members, which is most extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The amendment is important because the Government trots out arguments on matters such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. However, that is a temporary measure for which narrow parameters have been set in respect of its operation, including eligibility. In addition, the temporary scheme for family reunification is fundamentally different from an amendment to legislation which places family reunification on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I will support the amendment, although I have one query regarding the Bill. Section 2 refers to circumstances in which "the sponsor is a civil partner". Given that many of the countries from which refugees come do not make any provision for civil partnerships, this wording is rather unusual. I suppose there may be one or two countries which make such provision but many of the societies and countries from which people seek refuge in this country do not make any provision for civil partnerships. In fact, many are extremely homophobic, although not all civil partners are of the same sex. This point needs to be registered.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">First of all, the situation has not changed since the last time that we were here. The Government opposes the Bill in its entirety in line with its decision to refuse to grant the money message for the Bill. This is being done because of the impact that the Bill will have on the already small amount of accommodation available for those fleeing conflict whom we have committed to house under the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP. The Bill would add significantly to the pressures on the supply of housing where existing family members reside. It would make it impossible for local authorities and others to quantify how many individuals may ultimately have a right to reside in a local area following an offer of accommodation to one family unit. Ireland already prioritises families under the IRPP as both the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I have said in the Second Stage and Committee Stage debates. This Bill is undoubtedly very well intentioned and I agree with colleagues who have recognised that, but it has unquantifiable impacts on the resources required, including for social housing and other State-provided supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Ireland already has a broader definition of family reunification than other member states facing significant demands on their services. By seeking to broaden the scope and definition of family members eligible for family reunification and reintroducing an open-ended process, the Bill would also have the unintended but direct consequence of limiting the support that the State can provide for future international crises by way of resettlement and humanitarian admission of refugees. The Government's position is that the International Protection Act 2015 should continue to operate to support the maximum number of families rather than a smaller number of families being able to admit larger numbers of extended family members to the disadvantage of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I will take the opportunity to address an issue which has arisen since I last addressed the House about this Bill on Committee Stage in November. The Civil Engagement group has queried the statistics on the number of applications for family reunifications. I made my intervention particularly by reference to a parliamentary question answer by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on 29 November 2017. That parliamentary question answer gives the number of applications for family reunification each year between 2012 and 2016 and the number of eligible family members included in those applications. It does not provide a breakdown of the number of family members applied for per application. In the briefing document circulated by the Civil Engagement group in advance of Report Stage, the table included, although the source is listed as the Houses of the Oireachtas, is not the table included in the official response by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in the parliamentary question on 29 November. An additional column has been added to the end of the published table which refers to the average number of eligible family members applied for. This has not been prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality and is not part of the Minister's response to the parliamentary question.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">In the official response, the Minister clearly states that, in some cases, only one family member might have applied or in some cases there might be a much wider dispersal of family members. It also does not include the figures for applications for family members who were outside the scope of the legislation and were therefore rejected at first instance. They were, however, received as applications and still need to be assessed as such. I trust that clarifies that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The reintroduction of an open-ended family reunification process for extended family members will, by necessity, limit the scope of our response to future international humanitarian crises. It would be impossible, if one had an open-ended process, to quantify for housing and service providers an accurate account of what services will be needed now and in the future. The small community has some houses available now but cannot know how many people will ultimately arrive in their town. We will either see housing stock being withheld to cope with that unknown future demand or offers diminishing as a result of this open-ended process. We cannot afford any more uncertainty to compete with scarce resources. The only impact it will have is to reduce further the housing stock that may be available to us, and this unintended consequence will greatly impact on those needing protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> While we all support providing the highest level of assistance and help to beneficiaries and their families to integrate their communities, we must balance this with the needs of supporting those who remain most vulnerable, in particular those who are referred to us by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, from its refugee camps. We already have a waiting list of people who we have accepted to come here from UNHCR camps. We are not prepared to add in a new category further ahead of these especially vulnerable people in the queue. We have made a commitment to bring 4,000 people in need of protection to Ireland, and we are resolute that we will bring them here to safety despite the enormous housing challenge that we face. The resources of the State are not unlimited, especially in the area of housing, and we must use these resources efficiently to maximise the contribution that the State can make to supporting beneficiaries already in the State while continuing to enhance resettlement efforts and supporting solidarity efforts among EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Senators should not forget that alternative avenues for family reunification for extended family members are already available under the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, non-EEA policy document on family reunification. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, can and does use his discretion under this policy document to waive the economic conditions for certain extended family members. All applications are examined on a case-by-case basis. It is vital that we maintain this discretionary element that disappears once categories of persons are selected and put into law as this Bill proposes. The family reunification humanitarian admissions programme, FRHAP, is a natural extension of this existing policy, allowing for the humanitarian use of discretion and considerable flexibility. If, in the rolling out of the family reunification humanitarian admission programme, a particular issue arises, it can also be quickly addressed as the scheme can be more flexible and responsive than formal legislation when required. The Oireachtas joint committee called for a humanitarian scheme to be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The Government is committed to supporting beneficiaries of international protection and their families in the State and to providing opportunities to respond to ongoing and future crises by way of resettlement and humanitarian admission. However, for the important reasons I have outlined, we cannot support this Bill. The unintended consequences of well-motivated legislation may, in effect, impede progress on this humanitarian issue, leaving those in need of protection in camps abroad further down the housing list and further delaying their arrival to safety in Ireland. It is a price that we are not willing to pay on their behalf. The Government has listened to previous debate and has heard the advice of colleagues to prioritise conflict zones and to maximise use of discretion in dealing with humanitarian issues. Discretion is important. I am confident that a combination of the IRPP and the FRHAP are a more fitting and flexible response to the immediate needs of those fleeing conflict. They are already up and running and responding to this grave need. I look forward to the rolling out of FRHAP in the coming weeks. It will achieve, in a shorter timeframe, what the intentions behind this Bill seek to achieve. We are already doing that.</p>

          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_610">The Minister of State and I worked together very closely on many things and agree on many things. We disagree, unfortunately, about the means but not the end of how we get to being decent to people in trouble all over the world. Despite overwhelming evidence about the merits of keeping refugee families together, the Government has limited opportunities for family reunions set out in law. Changes resulting from the International Protection Act may be unintended consequences too and have meant that only a very restricted category of family member can apply to be reunited - essentially, spouses, parents of minor children and children under the age of 18. The restrictions of the International Protection Act are having a devastating impact on people. I know that from the work I know through Nasc in Cork, the Irish Refugee Council, Oxfam and others. However, we have an opportunity today to right this wrong. I am seeking to amend the International Protection Act which is failing a great many people. I am seeking to return to the provisions that were enshrined in Ireland's Refugee Act 1996. I am hardly proposing revolution or radicalism. It is legislation that was more flexible, more able to respond to the realities of international refugee crises such as we find ourselves in today, and more fit to protect and respect the rights of all refugees who would seek a safe haven in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Some of the reasons that have been given by Government for its opposition to the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill, do not stack up. I disagree that the Bill is unquantifiable. When the Refugee Act 1996 was in force, which is all that we want to go back to, the number of people applying in Ireland was relatively low. We were given misleading information about the average numbers of family members applied for under the reunification provisions of the Refugee Act. We were told that the average number of family members applied for was 20 and the largest application was for more than 70 family members. I checked the facts from the information given by the Department of Justice and Equality when referring to eligible family members. It is important to compare like with like.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I accept the Minister's point that the Department did not provide that figure but if one extrapolates from the figures provided it is about two people. For the purposes of this Bill I am talking about eligible family members. The number of eligible family members applying is borne out by Nasc, which says it is approximately two to three people from its perspective and the UNHCR says it is between three and four. Those figures were put on the record at the European Migration Network conference last November. The Government said it would introduce a new temporary scheme of family reunification - the humanitarian admissions programme - which would do away with the need for the family reunification Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> The humanitarian admissions programme is very welcome and complementary to the family reunification Bill but the humanitarian admissions programme is a temporary scheme with narrow parameters, a two-year life span and it is limited to people living in UNHCR-established conflict zones. We know there are people in trouble who live outside of those zones whom we would seek to help. The humanitarian admissions programme is fundamentally different from an amendment to legislation which would place family reunification on a statutory footing. We are still waiting to hear more detail about the humanitarian admissions programme from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The family reunification Bill is not open ended, as was charged by the Government. The Bill is well defined and focuses on family members who are "dependent on the qualified person or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself". The resources or a money message obstacle should not apply or be used to block this Bill as resources have already been allocated by Government for this area of public policy and international commitments, which we are missing.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Which of us if we, by accident of birth, country or region, had to flee for our very lives, leave our beloved families, our country and home and by some miracle reached a safe shore, would not wish to reunite with our families especially if they needed us and were unable to fend for themselves? Last week I witnessed many acts of random kindness to strangers in the snow. Men and women from the ambulance service and the Army carried a woman in her late 80s who had a turn down a steep and snowy hill to hospital. It is Ireland's turn now do some "lifting up" of people. People are depending on us to do the right thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">Thank you very much, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I wanted to be clear on that. I spend a lot of my time working with asylum seekers and refugees. In fact, I have spent almost all day today on this particular area dealing with people on the ground so I am very aware of the pressures, problems and issues that arise, as are colleagues here. I respect the genuine concern Senators have, in particular that of Senator Colette Kelleher, but I must caution that there are times when one could have unintended consequences and in working to make something better one could make it infinitely worse. I am genuine about that and advise caution.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Section 2, for example, proposes the deletion of section 56(8) of the International Protection Act 2015, which introduces a 12-month time limit from the making of a family reunification application after the granting of international protection status. Section 56(9) of the International Act 2015 already includes the text proposed in section 56(8)(a) to (d) in this Private Members' Bill. A new paragraph (e) is to be inserted to broaden the scope of the definition of family members eligible to include a grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the sponsor who is dependent on the sponsor - essentially reinstating section 18(4) under the repealed Refugee Act 1996, but without the discretionary element for the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I announced last November a family reunification humanitarian admissions programme, which will cover many of the family members proposed for inclusion under paragraph (e) of subsection (8) of this Bill. We will shortly be opening the applications process for the programme. It will prioritise applications from beneficiaries of international protection here who have the capacity to offer accommodation to their family member, thus not increasing demand on limited housing supply, particularly in small communities. This is a quicker, fairer and less cumbersome process than the measure proposed. Therefore the Government opposes the section. Subsection (8), paragraphs (a) to (d) of the Bill are already found in section 56(9) of the International Protection Act 2015, which means there is an element of duplication and that complicates matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> The removal of a time limit for the making of an application once international protection status has been granted, which is an established practice under EU law, would lead to an open-ended family reunification process. This is counter to the practice of our fellow EU member states. It would also substantially curtail the State's ability to respond to ongoing and future crises by way of resettlement and other forms of humanitarian admission because we could not provide certainty in numbers for service providers and the openended approach here may result in a shortfall in offers which would have serious consequences for those families hoping to be resettled as soon as possible under the IRPP. It is also contrary to the principle of family reunification, which should be to ensure that families are reunited as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> As I have previously stated, our priority is to ensure that we can support a maximum number of families, rather than having a smaller number of families being able to admit larger numbers of extended family members to the disadvantage of others. The provisions of the International Protection Act 2015 provide specific rights for family reunification and a pathway to reunification for family members of those granted international protection, which is less restrictive in terms of both the application time limits and the economic conditions which may be imposed by other EU member states. The EU family reunification directive provides for a similar definition of eligible family members as is found in the International Protection Act 2015. In addition, persons granted subsidiary protection status, as opposed to refugee status, are excluded from the right to family reunification under the EU directive. That is not the case in our legislation where those granted subsidiary protection are treated in the same way as those with refugee status. The Government is determined to maintain this broader facility at a time when some member states are restricting numbers arising from heavy demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> In subsection 8 paragraph (e), it is unclear how the nature of the dependency of the family member on the sponsor can be assessed or verified. We do not need opaque measures being brought into law.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> I also wish to note that the Report on Immigration, Asylum and the Refugee Crisis produced by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality last year did not recommend widening the scope of the definition of member of the family in sections 56 and 57 of the International Protection Act or the removal of the 12-month time limit for a sponsor to make an application for a family member to enter and reside in the State. It did recommend that the Government would introduce a humanitarian admission programme for beneficiaries of international protection with family members living in conflict zones. In response, as I have already mentioned, last November, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I announced the establishment of a family reunification humanitarian admission programme. Since then, the Department of Justice and Equality has been working closely with UNHCR Ireland to refine the operational details of the programme. I am pleased to say that those have now been finalised and the first call for applications under the scheme will open in April.<b> </b></p>

          <p eId="para_730">I recognise the genuine way in which colleagues have approached this issue and supported the ongoing work, which has been challenging. What is happening internationally is difficult and very alarming. Things are not getting any better out there, but worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I take all legislation and suggestions that come to me from this and the Lower House seriously. Where possible, we incorporate them following robust debate. However, where I feel that legislation or suggestions could have a detrimental effect, then I must be honest with colleagues and say that we should think about it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> To be helpful, if colleagues want briefings from officials, we can arrange for that. They might get an insight into the other challenges. I want to be as helpful and open as I can with everyone across the House on this issue, which should not divide us but unite us, because it is so important. In my daily work, I meet victims of torture, as I know colleagues do. Sometimes, I feel like our world is going backwards instead of forwards, but we live in hope.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">Senator Kelleher spoke so well, I believed I had a right to respond, but obviously I was mistaken. The Report on Immigration, Asylum and the Refugee Crisis produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last year did not recommend widening the scope of the definition of "member of the family" in sections 56 and 57 of the International Protection Act or the removal of the 12-month time limit for a sponsor to make an application for a family member to enter and reside in the State. I was Chair of that committee for quite a bit. Its reports are well researched and need to be taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The report in question recommended that the Government introduce a humanitarian admissions programme for beneficiaries of international protection with family members living in conflict zones. In response, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I announced last November the establishment of a family reunification humanitarian admissions programme, FRHAP. Since then, the Department of Justice and Equality has been working closely with UNHCR Ireland to refine the programme's operational details. I am pleased to say that these have been finalised and the first call for applications under the scheme will open in April. We are doing a great deal of what Senators want virtually straight away. Two further calls will be made this year, with an expected four open calls in total in 2019. Every quarter, a call will be open for four weeks. As we announced in November, the intention is to provide for the reunification of more than 500 vulnerable family members over the next two years. This is in addition to the 600 programme refugees whom we have agreed to resettle this year and a further 600 resettlement places that we have pledged for next year. In case there is a feeling out there that we are not doing anything and nothing is happening, this is what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> The FRHAP is being limited to conflict zones for a reason. We listened carefully when, in recent debates, Senators strongly cited conflict zones from which people were fleeing. Otherwise, this Bill would have prioritised regular applicants, such as people from Georgia and Albania, ahead of Syrians. We got the hint from colleagues in the House that they wanted to prioritise the most impacted people from conflict zones. That is what we are trying to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The measures in the International Protection Act are more broadly based than in many European countries. For example, Germany does not give family reunification to those granted subsidiary protection as we do. We constantly want to improve what we have and do better. The Refugee Act was discretionary, whereas the proposal in this Bill is mandatory. Rather than mirroring the provision, it introduces a concept that did not previously exist. This is another important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I thank colleagues for the work they have done on this Bill and for holding this debate. It is an important issue, but there are other considerations and unintended consequences could flow from passing this. If colleagues have other ideas and suggestions, want to introduce legislation and want to sit down with departmental officials to get an insight into the impact of, for example, the unintended consequences, I am happy to arrange for that and to be helpful, but we should not divide on this matter. It should not be a political issue. The Minister and I want to do the best we can to support the most vulnerable people out there. After we have introduced the FRHAP in April, I will invite colleagues to tell us how it is working. We are working with UNHCR Ireland on it. It is an ambitious and important programme, and it will make a major difference. The Minister's discretion is still maintained because discretion is important and we do not want to remove it under any circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and colleagues for their attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">I will begin by apologising to the proposers, the Minister of State and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for being unable to contribute on Report Stage. I commend the proposers, in particular Senator Kelleher, who has done a phenomenal degree of work on this and other issues relating to human rights, civil liberties, equality and fair treatment. Civil liberties and human rights are beautiful things. They are things that we value, love and cherish for ourselves, and this legislation is about sharing that same ethos with people who come from elsewhere to live here. Trojan work has been done on the Bill and, notwithstanding what the Minister of State has said, today is a good day. As the Bill progresses to the other House, we will have the opportunity to refine it and deal with some of the issues, even though it is already commendable legislation, but that is up to Senator Kelleher and those who are champions in this field, such as the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Today is a good day and the Bill's passage through the House is welcome. I commend the proposers and the work that has been done.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">I will be brief, as the final comment will be from my colleague, Senator Kelleher. I commend her on her extraordinary work in bringing this important Bill through the House, and I thank everyone in the House who has supported it.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Mine is a simple and small point. There is no limitation on being good and delivering our targets. The Minister of State referred to the European target of 40,000 refugees to which Ireland agreed, but it has not even come close to being reached. As such, it would be inappropriate for us to place vulnerable persons in a competition against other vulnerable persons. The small number of people who have been awarded refugee status and whom Ireland takes in have the right to have their closest and dependent family members with them. This is not something that we should be setting against other important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I wish to raise a concern on a practical level.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Minister of State has spoken about a Government decision to deny a money message. The denial of a money message is a matter that can only take place in the Lower House of the Oireachtas. Moreover a decision on a money message can only be made following a decision of the Ceann Comhairle that a money message is required in respect of a Bill. The decision on a money message comes between the Second and Committee Stages in the Dáil. I think it is very important that there be no signal sent out that due process and proper full consideration would not be given to this Bill. I know and I am sure that other Members will be demanding and expecting that the Bill be given its full consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The Minister of State raised the question of discretion. He may well have amendments or proposals in respect of ministerial discretion and I am sure that they will be listened to openly and given proper consideration. For the amendments to be given proper consideration, the Bill must proceed to Committee Stage for a full discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I plead that the Bill be given the full consideration of the Dáil. This is a very positive day for Ireland in sending a positive signal. Given that we hosted the UN meeting on refugees more than one year ago, we take the issue seriously and will follow through on the message we send at the highest level.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_749">I will be as brief as I can be. I am delighted the International Protection (Family Reunification) Bill 2017 has passed. On behalf of the Civil Engagement group I especially commend our colleague, Senator Colette Kelleher, and her office for their incredible leadership on this issue. Senator Kelleher has done phenomenal work. I would particularly like to note the contribution of Mr. Pádraig Rice, who did amazing work on this before leaving Leinster House to move back to Cork. This Bill is a testament to both of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I know my colleague will thank the Irish Refugee Council, Oxfam Ireland and Nasc for their years of dedication on this issue and help in developing the legislation. It is a modest but meaningful change that will see us treat refugees arriving in Ireland with more compassion, kindness and understanding. Ireland is at its best when we extend a hand of friendship to those seeking refuge on our shores. This is how we should react to the most serious humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Importantly, this is not just a more humane way to treat people, it is also smarter policy - we know that people fare better with their families around them. How can a person focus on a new home, a new community, a new life, when one does not know if one's children or parents are safe from harm on the other side of the world? These people have already been through so much. It is harrowing to hear about the additional trauma, stress and anxiety caused by constant worrying about the welfare of one's loved ones. A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I just need two seconds to comment on one interviewee from South Sudan who spoke about how difficult it was without his family, stating that: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_752">I miss my mother, my father, my sister, my brother. If I talk to them and somebody is sick I can’t sleep because I think about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> On meeting his family another interviewee said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">I saw my wife and I cried. Because of joy but also because she was really tired - when I saw her face, I could see it. The kids were OK, they were OK. We took the bus and the minute we boarded, and with the children around and my wife sitting next to me, she put her head on my shoulder and she slept. She was totally at ease - all her worries had gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">That is what this Bill is all about. That is why we proposed this legislation - for moments that respect the dignity of all human beings and the need for a humane, compassionate response to those fleeing war and persecution. I am calling on all colleagues to support this Bill today, to support this Bill in the Dáil, and to enact it as quickly as possible. We have an opportunity to keep refugee families together and we should take it.</p>

          <p eId="para_756">In her two years in this House, Senator Colette Kelleher has made an indelible contribution on social issues about which we care deeply. I think back to the time when Traveller ethnicity was recognised. That was a great day.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> This is a great day for Senator Kelleher to have her Private Members' Bill pass through the Seanad, without Government support. This was probably due to technical reasons. I am very happy for Senator Kelleher because I know how committed and passionate she is on these issues. This Bill has made us think about these issues in greater depth than we would otherwise. It does impact on people coming from the most difficult part of our planet. I am very happy that we have a Minister of State in the person of Deputy David Stanton who is leading this country's humanitarian response. I know the Minister of State would like to be able to do a whole lot more but there is only so much that can be done. There are constraints and challenges. In my own community in north Clare, the Department will open a direct provision centre in Lisdoonvarna. Even in a small community such as Lisdoonvarna which is very welcoming of people, there is fear of the unknown. We all face challenges. We all have to show leadership where we can. </p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Senator Kelleher has shown leadership. All Senators in this House show leadership in trying to do the right thing. It is important to salute and recognise the work of Senator Kelleher and the Minister of State who provide the type of leadership that we can all be proud of and which we are proud of.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">Let me reiterate that I recognise the genuine approach of Members. I listened to Senator Higgins's contribution on the money message. I apologise if I was in any way misleading. I will definitely check it out and look at it in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> If Senators have suggestions about legislation or changes in the legislation that they would like to bring forward in this area, I request that they please contact me and we can arrange briefings for them before they go further, in case there are issues on which they need to be aware, as I firmly believe is the case in this Bill. I think there are traps that could actually make things worse for people. I am not trying to be political but having looked at the Bill that is my genuine opinion. I think we should let the family reunification humanitarian admission programme go forward and see how it works and keep the discretion and the lines of communication open.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> As I said earlier, we live in a global world that is becoming increasingly violent. There are more than 65 million people displaced across the globe and the situation does not seem to be getting any better. There are intractable conflicts. Many of these conflicts are between people in these countries. There are very few conflicts that are between countries, but there is internal conflict and some of the consequences are absolutely awful. One could not comprehend the inhumanity that is happening in many states across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> We are a very small country on the edge of Europe and we are doing the best we can. Thankfully we do not have any reaction to migration, as is happening in other countries. We can see in neighbouring states the negative reaction to migration and the impact it is having. I am concerned about the longer-term impact. We have to be very careful about that too, that it does not start up here. So far it has not happened, but I get messages accusing me of being a person who likes people who should not be in Ireland. I will not go into detail, but some of the messages are not repeatable. We must be careful that such tensions are not stoked up in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> I am genuine about the legislation. I invite Members to contact my Department if they have ideas or suggestions that they would like to progress. We will advise and support if we can, but obviously there is a process. When a Bill is passed by the Seanad it will go to the Dáil. It is possible that it can be improved in the Dáil, but I think we should allow the new family reunification humanitarian admission programme schemes time to bed down and see how they work. They will take time and resources and they are focused on the most vulnerable people. </p>
          <p eId="para_765"> On the previous occasion I was in the House, Members were highlighting the violent areas in the world where people are living on what I term "hell on earth".</p>

          <p eId="para_767">I genuinely appreciate the offer of the Minister of State to continue to work with me on this Bill. I think we differ on the means in this instance, but we share the end that we wish to achieve. I see that from the work we have done on other issues together.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">We differ on the best routes to achieve that end, but I am very happy that the door is and will remain open. We will continue to work together on this and other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> There are many reasons it is right to support the Bill and send it to the Dáil where it will be in the capable hands of Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin who will steer it on its passage though the Lower House. They include the 65.5 million people forcibly displaced throughout the world; the 22.5 million refugees worldwide; the more than 11 million child refugees who are vulnerable to many dangers; the 1 million people, of whom 600,000 are children, with cholera in Yemen where public health and sanitation services have broken down because of war; and the 1 million people who risked their lives to reach Europe by sea. The reason there is strain on countries such as Italy which take a disproportionate number of refugees may be we need to do more in Ireland. If we do not want to see a reaction, we must play our part and share the load. Other reasons to support the Bill are the 4,500 people missing in the Mediterranean who attempted to cross in inadequate and dangerous boats in the hope of reaching safety, the 900,000 Rohingya refugees who were displaced and ethnically cleansed to Bangladesh and the 2,700 people who ought to have been welcomed to Ireland to meet our pledge to welcome 4,000 refugees under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. Which of us would not flee and seek international protection if we were in the same desperate and unimaginable position as many of those mentioned who are in it through no fault of our own but by accident of birth or geography?</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> People who have fled have given their reasons having a decent system of family reunification for refugees and their families is so important. They are reasons all Members will recognise. A recently interviewed person who is originally from Syria said: "It wasn’t a decision to come to Ireland – it was to Europe, any place where I can be safe, try to get my family, live my life like any normal person." A man who had fled from Sudan said: "One of the hardest things – going from [being] a father and husband and brother to just a piece of luggage." A person from the Central African Republic said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_771">I was very happy [to receive refugee status] but still very disturbed because still up until that time I had no answer from the Red Cross apart from saying that they have received my file and they are doing the search [for his family]. I was still very perplexed and so that was the feeling. [We went a longer time period than 12 months because such searches for families can take a very long time when people are in very uncertain circumstances.] I was happy to have the refugee status but ... I don’t have any soil under the legs because I was still looking for my family, for my children ... My life was all about my family. Even today, it is all about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">A person from Sudan said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_773">Before my family got here, I sometimes did nothing – nothing important. I’d get up every morning and then try and find something to make myself helpful ... I went to the college – still I am in college. But I was not settled, I was not happy. I was worried. But when I got them here, I am feeling much more settled, thinking positive things.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">They are reasons given by people who are directly affected by our family reunification arrangements and for whom we could make things better by supporting the Bill. I have my reasons for doing so and, if Senators dig deep, they will have their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> During the summer I read a book entitled,<i> East West Street</i>, by Phillipe Sands, a human rights lawyer. It tells the life story of Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the principal architects of the internationally recognised law covering crimes against humanity. His work on an international bill of rights for the individual inspired the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. He had lost most of his family in the Holocaust but was able to bring his niece, Inka, to England. She watched through the window as her mother was arrested and saw her father running out after her. She never saw them again and was left to fend for herself at the age of 12 years. Hersch Lauterpacht brought her to safety in Cambridge, thus uniting what was left of his family. Under our family reunification rules, he would not be able to do so as of right and that must change. In London next week I will be meeting friends, many of whom are second or third generation Jewish refugees. Some lost large numbers of their families, while, thankfully, others escaped and brought their families with them to safety in England. A restrictive family reunification regime might have left my friends behind, never to have the chance of a good or any life.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I first came across the word "refugee" when, with my father, a butcher, I was taking a gift of parcels of meat to Kilworth Camp in Cork where people who had fled from the North to the South, which was safer during the Troubles, were given refuge. It was the first time I had met refugees and I was eight or nine years old. My father taught me a lesson for life: to be kind and generous and extend the hand of friendship, especially in people's hour of need. The International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill recognises and addresses these sentiments and all of the reasons I have given. Senators will have their own. I am very pleased to have the support of the House to send the Bill to the Dáil where it may be improved. I hope the Minister of State and his colleagues will do so before exposing it to the chill of a money message.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_778">I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the Government on Project Ireland 2040, which is a joint initiative with the national planning framework and the national development plan. There are a few thoughts I would like to share in advance of the Senators' contributions, and the officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have regard to those as well. I thank the House for the opportunity to make these opening remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> The construct of the national development plan, which is the expenditure element of Project Ireland 2040, comes from the foundations of a recovering economy. That facilitates our current position, where the capital envelope that we have available to us as a Government is of the order of €116 billion over ten years. It is important for those in the House and everybody else to put this in perspective. It is a short period in some ways but a long time in other ways, if we consider the effects that the economic crash had on the country, and it is a phenomenal achievement to be in a position to bring forward an investment package of anything of the order of €116 billion for the people of Ireland. It is the contribution, work and sacrifices of the people of Ireland that have resulted in the economic position we currently enjoy, led by the policies adopted over the past few years, many of which were criticised and opposed in this and the other House. We are where we are and we now have the money to invest in a variety of different projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The plan includes €91 billion of direct Exchequer-related funding and a further €25 billion from our semi-State companies, which will be empowered under the national development plan. They have signalled the projects already identified as priority areas across a range of sectors, including ports, airports and other elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Some €75 billion is new funding. There are many new projects not identified nor referred to previously. As confirmed, investment will be among the highest in the European Union. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, have often referred to the lost decade Ireland endured over the last number of years. This is certainly something we are now playing catch-up with. However, we are lucky to be in a situation where we have the money and investment opportunity to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> The plan is based on costed and prudent projections of growth of 2% over the period 2022 to 2027. That is important bearing in mind, and we have said this both here and elsewhere, the shocks that could potentially be out there on the horizon for this economy and, as a result, for the people. The growth rates are based on projections the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance are happy to stand over.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> In respect of how the national development plan was developed, and how it came to be where it is today, public consultation was formally started by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in March 2017. That public consultation included engagements at a political level and requests made in many of the Topical Issue matters debates, Commencement matters debates and parliamentary questions and by delegations from local authorities and so on. There was also extensive consultation on the national planning framework. That is the document on which the national development plan is predicated. It is the first time in the history of rolling out either a national development plan or a planning framework that we do not have one in isolation from the other and have both of them together. We now have the plan and the money to deliver on the projects we believe are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> The different regions across the country are going to feel differently about how the plan is going to impact on them. The projects are going to be different. I want to refer to my own region and I am sure Senators will use the opportunity to reference their own areas as well. I will give an example of a region outside Dublin that often is referenced and how that may-----</p>

          <p eId="para_786">-----benefit from capital investment. A decision has finally been taken in the mid-western region on existing and additional bed capacity in University Hospital Limerick. Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and the University of Limerick, UL, are being allowed to develop new facilities, such as engineering facilities in LIT. The Shannon Foynes Port Company, the only strategic port of national importance on the west coast, will be able to extend its capacity. Wide-bodied hangers are being constructed at Shannon Airport. New students will enter UL with additional sports facilities and student recreation areas. Anybody who has ever had reason to travel to Limerick, Tralee or Killarney will know the bottlenecks in Adare, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale. The N21 is finally going to deal with them. There will also be improvements in other road infrastructure in the region. That is only one example of one region. There are other regions in the country, whether in the south, east or north west, where specific projects can also be identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The linkages needed on the Atlantic corridor are one of the key fundamental cornerstones of this development plan. That is why the Government committed to the completion of the N20 early in the lifetime of this plan. It has long been spoken about and there are Senators in this House from the southern region, including Cork, and from the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> We know counterbalance is badly needed between Dublin and the west coast. The conurbation of Dublin can only be balanced if Galway, Limerick and Cork are brought closer together. We already have the motorway link from Limerick to Galway. Now we are in the situation where we are able to provide the funding and green light for planning to proceed on the M20 from Limerick to Cork. This will represent €900 million or thereabouts. There will be little change out of €1 billion. That is proof, if any was needed, of the Government's investment in a rural area in the mid-west and in the south.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Support for rural areas is an issue that has often been raised in the Seanad and in the other House. This plan includes specific targets and specific programmes for investment in a range of areas, including broadband, roads, tourism and in agriculture. By 2020, on the basis of the plan we have <i>in situ</i> for the connection to broadband, we will have 90% coverage of premises to high speed broadband. That is one of the key drivers and enablers for the development of the rural economy and I know there are many Senators here this evening from rural areas. I want to thank those Senators who have turned up to engage in this debate because I know the importance that they place on it. The plan will also allow other areas of the east to develop as counterbalances to Dublin itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I mentioned the risk factors that are there. This plan will be predicated on economic factors. I know Senators have debated on many occasions the issue of Brexit and the all-island economy. The Government, through the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Finance, has been very clear that in relation to Brexit the national development plan will allow for better quality infrastructure to mitigate against the effects. Previously, we have seen the Government's commitment to this, particularly in the north west and the Border region. Investment particularly relevant in the context of Brexit will include the areas of the integrated transport network, energy and communications and new resources for tourism development. I am a former Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport so I know how important the development of tourism is, particularly given the exposure to Brexit, and now that we have growing numbers of people working in that sector. It is close on 10% of the total number of people who work in Ireland, supporting communities and economies across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> I refer also to supporting Brexit-exposed firms to diversify into international markets. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, is keen through her agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to drive that and I have seen that at first hand overseas. We also have for the first time a new disruptive technology fund. We are all becoming more aware of disruptive technologies in a very challenging environment for the economy and for exporters in particular, but also for the domestic economy. The fund will allow access to supports not there heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Recently, as Senators will be aware, there has been some dialogue and conversation in respect of the use and roll-out of the public private partnership, PPP, model. The completion of the review into the PPPs will be published shortly. PPPs will continue to form a part of the delivery of key infrastructure. Over many years, we have seen that they have been an effective procurement option. I am the Minister of State with responsibility for procurement. Yes, there have been challenges. As a Government, we are committed to resolving those. However, we are also committed to driving the clear principles of value for money as well as project delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The plan builds on previous reforms, including the public spending code and the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement. As I mentioned previously both here and in the other House, I have further ambition in respect of the Office of Government Procurement. Any Member of the Houses who has served on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach or on the Committee of Public Accounts, any Member of the Dáil or anyone reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report would see clearly that we have continuing issues in relation to public procurement and public governance. This is one of the areas into which the Office of Government Procurement is going to have to try to delve more and it is my intention, as Minister of State, to push that agenda. We are going to have many and competing demands in the area of procurement now that we have in excess of €116 billion to spend over ten years. We want to make sure we do it right. We want to make sure it is delivered to the areas to which it needs to be delivered and that we make sure we have proper project appraisal, delivery and management. Having come from the engineering section of a private sector company, I know that product and project delivery and schedule adherence is something to which the public service has to become more attuned. However, I know the public service is up for that through the Office of Government Procurement and through the public spending codes.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> We also need to continue the implementation of the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, assessment carried out in 2017. We need, in particular, to continue to drive the infrastructure project steering group that will be established in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is one thing having a plan but it is another making sure we continue the delivery. We will monitor that delivery. That will be done on a centralised basis through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and also through other Departments drawing down funding, whether it is education, health, transport or whatever, or State agencies. We need to make sure monitor delivery and value for money from the centre. Ultimately, what is important here is that we deliver the projects but that we have regard to value for money in respect of the taxes that have been collected from the people which allow us to spend this money.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">There is a rural and urban element and the sum of €4 billion is split on a 2:1 basis. Taking the population of the country, it will be seen that the expenditure element is stacked in favour of rural areas, and rightly so. By rural I mean small towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> As Senators will know, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, is at a new Department. It is now up and running and is delivering on schemes that this House and the Lower House have constantly demanded. We now have a fund worth €1 billion. The Minister for Rural and Community Development and his officials are considering projects and methodologies for the expenditure of that money. I encourage the Senators to liaise directly with him because he is open to hearing ideas from all of us, in particular from rural areas, on how to stem the tide of people leaving towns and villages. Will shops be reopened in the future? I do not know. I come from a rural area and I know that we will have rural regeneration if one or two more families decide to live on every street in villages in the country. One of the areas that I have spoken to him about is rural dereliction and the possibility of providing direct or indirect supports for local authorities or property owners. The measure would address rural dereliction, make places more attractive to people and, as a result, services in the commercial and private worlds would follow. It is important to point out that there is a regeneration fund for urban development which can also be used for rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> All I wanted to do in this debate was to share with Senators my thoughts as Minister of State and, more importantly, hear what types of projects they would like to be delivered. In terms of everything that is committed by way of spending that is already guaranteed to be delivered to particular projects, there will be elements of discretion within individual Departments. Interestingly, over recent weeks, there has been some noise about the delivery and publication of the national development plan. However, I have yet to hear anybody say that he or she did not like a particular project. Everybody agrees with having a national development plan. Some people have suggested that had we followed those people's economic policies for the past five years, which consisted of telling the European Union to take its money and shove it in their you know where, we would have reached the position that we enjoy today, but that is not true. We would not have €116 billion to spend over ten years. I hope that the Seanad will do what it has always done any time that I have been here and engage constructively and proactively to see how things can be improved upon. If a Senator wants to say he or she does not like something, then please suggest an alternative project and what roads and hospital extensions should be removed from the plan. Everything in the plan has come by way of parliamentary input, public consultation and direct input by individual Departments. The plan has not been concocted on the basis of no need. The plan is based on very clear population growth projections supplied by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. It also has very clear and committed growth rates for our economic situation supplied by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The documents are costed and balanced in terms of where we believe the greatest level of need will be from an infrastructural point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has outlined the national planning framework. I am sure there will be opportunities in the House to consider the national planning framework from a planning point of view. From the point of view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the capital envelope that we have available to us at the moment is one that is only available due to the sacrifices that were made by the people of Ireland, together with the economic policies that were pursued over the past six to seven years, in particular, and which have allowed us to balance our books, have a balanced budget and, more importantly, have the ability to invest in capital. The population of Ireland is growing and will increase by 500,000. We will also have 300,000 more people at work. This year we will have the greatest number of people ever at work in Ireland. I hope we will reach full employment this year. We were told by all of the naysayers that full employment would never happen, that we would need a double bailout, that we should leave the euro, wind up the banks and tell everyone in Europe to go to hell on a donkey. If we had done that, where would we be now? We probably would be in an invidious position compared with some other countries that went into a bailout situation like us. They now look at Ireland with envy and wonder how we managed to have the largest capital envelope, based on the number of people who live here, of any EU or eurozone country. We have such success because the people of Ireland made sacrifices. The communities here that were starved of investment over the past ten years now need investment. The Taoiseach has often referred to that decade as the lost decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I am sure that the Acting Chairman and all of the Senators have digested the plan and will agree that the plan has content for the whole country. We want to see the country developed as a whole. We want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to rear a family, have a home and job in their local area, and provide that opportunity for themselves and future generations. That is what this plan and the national planning framework are about. I look forward to hearing suggestions and remarks from Senators. I commend the plan to the House and thank everyone for their forbearance.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">I have eight minutes but the Minister of State spoke for 19 minutes. I will do my best to respond to him in the time allocated. My party has done it before and we will do it again. I made very constructive comments when he was here for statements on the mid-term review of the capital plan last year. Certainly, my purpose in this Chamber is to be constructive and helpful. It is fantastic news that €116 billion will be spent as part of the national development plan. Interestingly, in the statement provided by the Minister of State, there are nine bullet points under the heading "Investment in Limerick and the Southern Region." Perhaps there are so many bullet points due to him being the Minister of State. Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or his Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, would have read the exact same speech or maybe not. I am very fond of Limerick and I am very fond of many people in Limerick and Limerick city and county. I know people in Pallaskenry who vote for the Minister of State and will do it again, and probably on my recommendation. This is a national development plan and, therefore, we need to ensure that we consider it as a national development plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">I recall one occasion where a certain Minister reminded me that Senators do not have constituencies and I replied that I had one where I live. I am a representative in the national Parliament, just like Senator Craughwell and most Senators. We are elected, thankfully, by the 31 local authorities in the country along with members of the outgoing Seanad and incoming Dáil. Senators are national politicians. Therefore, I am as interested in Buncrana in Donegal, New Ross in Wexford, Carlingford in Louth and Dingle in Kerry as I am in south Dublin. I am as interested in south Dublin as everywhere else. Today, we are discussing a national development plan that seems to revolve around the M20 motorway. I am concerned that the Minister of State, in his speech, has listed bullet points for Limerick and the southern region. When we discussed the mid-term review of the capital plan in the House, I was not only the only Senator from Dublin, I was the only Senator from Leinster out of a total number of 60 Senators. Every other contributor that was present was from Connacht, Ulster and Munster. I just wanted to put that fact on record.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> I welcome the national development plan, as I am sure we all do. I was Chair of the Dublin Regional Authority when the national development plan was launched in 2007 and it was a fantastic project. To be fair, it was well endorsed and welcomed by the Opposition. Lots of the plan happened but some of it did not. We need to remember that we have a comprehensive Luas project in Dublin that we would like to expand. The project is certainly a lot bigger than it was 15 years ago. We now have quality bus corridors, QBCs, that did not exist 20 years ago. We have lots of very important strategic infrastructure. A national motorway programme has been built and at the time people said that the boom was blown. Let us face it, we have a motorway project that has given us motorways to Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Cork and Belfast, which is fantastic. Let us not say that every penny that was spent during the boom years never delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> I happen to be a chairperson of a secondary school, and I was a chairperson of a different secondary school during the boom years. I can confirm that lots of windows and laboratories were replaced and many schools were built. I can confirm that lots of improvements were made during NDPs in the past. National development plans are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> We have to acknowledge that the difficulty with this plan, which is probably a good development in some ways for the Government, is the spin associated with it. For the past two or three weeks we have not been talking about the plan. We have had a chat about "Snowmageddon" and all the rest but we have moved the dialogue away from the actual content of the €113 billion, €115 billion or €116 billion plan; the figure has been moved around somewhat. The dialogue is all about the strategic communications unit, SCU, the spin and the advertorials, which is very unfortunate for Project Ireland 2040. We can forget about how good or bad it is for the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, the Fine Gael Party or the Minister, Deputy Naughten, who did not manage to make the cut in the Athlone advertorial or non-advertorial. The issue is that we have a national development plan that has been manipulated and massaged by central government. I am not blaming the Minister of State who is in the Chamber. I have no doubt he is a man of integrity and honesty who is doing his best for his area, but equally for national Government as much as for the people of rural Limerick. However, we have a project now that is mired in spin, the strategic communications unit, John Concannon and everything that goes with that. The difficulty now is that we have plans and projects that are being constantly re-announced. I have the height of respect for Senator Paddy Burke and Senator Colm Burke who are in the Chamber and will have to deliver a response on behalf of the Government, and more power to them. However, they have been put in a difficult and unfortunate position in that they have to stand up here and defend the spin machine I do not believe either of them or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, created, but they are stuck with it. </p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The reality is that we have invested €116 billion in a project, €42 billion of which was announced in 2015. It does not tackle issues in the short and medium term. As somebody who lives on the expanded Luas line, the Acting Chairman, Senator Craughwell, will be aware that the Luas service is worse now than ever was the case. He or I cannot deny that. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about that in the finance committee and he said we had a thriving green line and that he was sure the red line was equally as good. We are stuck in a situation now where its performance is far below what it was previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> The plans have failed to establish a new national infrastructure commission to take the politics out of these long-term issues. The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, has not really worked. As raised by my party leader, the Government strategic communications unit has paid for advertising content that is not identified as such. It has been raised many times since the announcement of Project Ireland 2040. It is genuinely sad that we are here in the Seanad discussing that two or three weeks after the launch of the national development plan. I got this copy of the national development plan today, not yesterday, two weeks ago or three weeks ago. The hard copy arrived in my pigeon hole today, and I saw copies in many other Members' pigeon holes. I will not go back to look at the date it was launched and count the number of days between then and now but it is at least three weeks since it was launched.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I wish the national development plan well. We need balanced regional development. We need Dublin to be a thriving city region competing with other city regions across Europe and the world. The Minister of State has a hard job defending the plan. It is unfortunate for him that he has been sent here by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to defend it. I will support him and the Government in everything they are trying to do on behalf of Project Ireland, but the way it was launched and the way it has been addressed so far is unfortunate.</p>

          <p eId="para_814"> I take on board what Senator Horkan said. He is right, but I am not surprised that the Minister of State should come in here as a Limerick-based Deputy and promote his projects in Limerick. I acknowledge that and fair play to him. I would do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Before I go into the depth of the plan and analyse it, I want to flag two issues close to my heart involving an area where I live in Dún Laoghaire, namely, Cherrywood and the LIHAF. We have a scheme to build 8,000 houses in Cherrywood and we were informed by the county manager and some staff at a briefing the other day that there was now a potential shortfall of €75 million to get this project going. Cherrywood is a strategic development zone with the potential to develop 8,000 homes and we are still not sure about the Minister's intentions regarding the LIHAF. It would be helpful if the Minister of State asked the Minister if he could make his views known and publicly indicate his commitments regarding the LIHAF and also on the question of affordability. What is the deal in terms of the delivery of affordable houses in Cherrywood?</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Second, the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is in bits, so to speak. Successive Governments promised that a new hospital would be built on the site. Some months ago the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, came out to turn a sod for a new development of 120 beds, but that will not be an additional 120 beds. The plan is to build 120 beds in two or three wings and knock down the existing 120 beds. There will be no increased capacity. I have attended three official announcements of a new hospital for the National Rehabilitation Hospital in the past ten years but there will not be a new hospital. There will be a phase 1 and phase 2 of a development. We need to be clear as to whether this is phase 1, phase 2 or a case of double counting. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could revert to me on that. We are talking about new beds and a new hospital. The Government is aware of the issue because I raise it every few weeks here in the Seanad. Twelve beds were closed on 1 January 2017 and despite numerous promises by numerous Ministers in this House to the effect that they will be reopened, we got confirmation the other day that six of them remain closed over a year later, with hundreds of patients waiting in acute beds to get into this hospital. The Minister of State invited us to comment on local issues and I wanted to raise that one.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I fully support the national development plan. It is a strong and positive move. It is great when all the plans are put in one cover and key objectives are set to deliver on them. My understanding of the journey of this national planning framework is that we will have compact growth and enhanced regional accessibility. We will strengthen rural economics in communities. They are key objectives of this plan. We will have sustainable mobility. A strong support for enterprise, innovation and skills is clearly set out in the plan. There will be high quality international connectivity. There will be enhanced amenity and heritage; there is a very good section on amenity and heritage. There will be a transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society, which is a topical and appropriate measure to include in a plan, and we will have sustainable management of our wastewater and other environmental resources. That is key. The plan further sets out the objective of access to quality child care, education and health services. Those strategic objectives are set out clearly in the plan and I could not argue with any of them. I would have liked to have seen more included but that is what is in the plan, and it is all very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> In terms of the strategic investments and priorities tied up with the plan, having studied it in great depth it is my understanding that we will have a housing and sustainable urban development, rural development and increased enterprise skills and innovative capacity - that has to be positive. There will be investment in culture, heritage and sports as part of the investment priorities tied up in the plan. Importantly, and we have seen it again in recent days, there will be major investment in the water infrastructure, which is critical for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The plan also covers the national roads network, environmental and sustainable public transport. There is a specific section dealing with airports and ports and other sections dealing with climate change and education, health and child care. That is exceptionally positive. The plan is ambitious, perhaps too ambitious. I do not like to use the words "too ambitious", as I like us to be ambitious. I also like what the Minister of State mentioned in his presentation about public private partnerships. We want to get projects over the line. I have met many people in politics who have an ideology about who is delivering the infrastructure and the houses. Clearly, we want houses delivered because we have a housing crisis. We need infrastructure if we are to grow our economy. We need to plan for the future, for the expansion of our people and our communities. The plan is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> A key aspect of the plan will be the way in which we as politicians across all parties can keep track of the Government in terms of its delivery. It is all very well to draw up a plan but the money, resources and required skills and expertise must be in place to deliver it. That is an important element. We as politicians, and through our membership of relevant committees such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which I am a member, will have to hold the Government to account. That will be the key message with respect to the plan. We will have to follow these projects and ensure they are delivered. This plan is a positive and brave move by the Government to commit its key objectives to paper as it did with Rebuilding Ireland. Many people have issues with Rebuilding Ireland but it is a plan. It has had slippages but at least we have a plan on which to focus. We can bring the Minister back in and talk about why projects we said we would do are not happening and why the targets that have been set down have not been achieved. Any plan gives us focus, it draws attention to a particular issue. I warmly welcome and support this plan. However, I believe we will all be back here asking in months to come how it is being rolled out and delivered. That is the key task with respect to this plan on which we will measure the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_821">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to the House and wish him, the Minister for Finance and the Government well with this plan. As Senator Boyhan said, the key point is that this plan should be delivered and timeframes should be set for projects and those timeframes should be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> This plan has been in gestation for a considerable period. It started in October 2014. Various bodies and groups throughout the length and breadth of the country made a considerable input to the plan. It started in October 2014 with the publication of the national planning framework map. Preliminary stakeholder consultation events were held. Several inputs in terms of Oireachtas briefings were made. Nearly every facet of society in the country ranging from the Oireachtas to business to non-governmental organisations had a say in this plan. I spoke about this plan at our parliamentary party meetings on a number of occasions. The Taoiseach said that he hoped to have it launched before Christmas. We had a further discussion on it at our parliamentary party meeting in January and we secured the inclusion of additional provisions in it. It is a very good plan. For the first time during my time in politics, in nearly 40 years, we have a plan that is being funded. We have had several plans down the years but no funding was put in place for them. Timeframes are being set and funding is being put in place for this plan for the next ten years, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> I also like another aspect of this plan, namely, some of the key facts and figures that are given. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach and I and the Acting Chairman, who is also a member of that committee, have the met the ESRI in Paris on a number of occasions. The ESRI is one of the best organisations that I have-----</p>

          <p eId="para_825">Or the OECD. It is one of the best organisations with which we have had meetings. There is input into the plan in terms of figures that have been put forward by the OECD and the ERSI. The ERSI stated that it expects the population to grow by 1 million up to 2040 and that 660,000 additional jobs will be created. I like the way in which the Government has split up investment under the plan throughout not only the various cities but the rural areas right down to the local towns. As was pointed out by several previous speakers, the Minister, Deputy Ring, will have €2 billion to invest in towns with a population over 10,000 people and €1 billion for towns with a population under 10,000 people. That is a great idea as it means towns in my county such as Castlebar, Westport, Ballina and Ballyhaunis will get their fair share of the spoils when they are handed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> A former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy announced a decentralisation programme in the early 2000s but no funding was put in place for it even he planned decentralisation programme to various towns throughout the country was a good plan but no funding was put in place for it. This plan should incorporate a certain degree of decentralisation and I hope that can happen. If a Department is decentralised to a town with a population of 10,000, 12,000 people or a greater number, its impact is probably better than the opening up of an industry in some cases. There is also the advantage of the availability of cheaper housing than is available in Dublin. There would be cheaper accommodation for the staff and for the various Departments and it also would free up office accommodation in the cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> It is a good idea to rebalance the population in the country. Dublin and the east coast has been growing at an enormous rate. While the boom years brought some great benefits with the building of motorways from Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Galway and the operation of fast rail services from Cork, Galway and Limerick to Dublin. However, a rebalancing of the population has not taken place. This plan can help in that respect. The plan will also help the north west and the western region which did not see the same level of investment as other regions during the boom years. The roads from Mullingar to Westport, Mullingar to Sligo and from Sligo to Donegal need to be greatly improved greatly. This plan provides that the Westport to Turlough section of the N5 will be funded over the next two years. The road from Mullingar to Longford will be a motorway and the road from Longford to Sligo and from Longford to Ballaghadereen are all included in this plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> The Technological Universities Bill, which is at the stage of almost being passed, will be a great addition to the regions in that we can say that we have a technological university in Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal. When they seek to sell their ideas, seek investment and foreign students, they can say that they have the numbers and large complexes with university status, which is a great selling point. </p>
          <p eId="para_829"> The EU Finance Commissioner appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach yesterday and he stated there was quite a considerable amount of funds in Europe that had not been drawn down by various countries although he did not mention Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I ask the Minister of State to look into that because the Commissioner said that it was inefficient departments and inefficient governments that had not drawn down those funds. He mentioned a number of countries. He did not mention Ireland. Perhaps that was because he was in Ireland or perhaps it is not the case here. If it is the case, however, I would like the Minister of State to look at the issue and to investigate whether there are funds which this country has not drawn down.</p>

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_832">I thank the Minister of State. As other speakers have said, we absolutely endorse the necessity for a national planning framework like this. I welcome some of the initiatives in it, particularly the Atlantic economic corridor. It has huge potential if the money is put into it. It is important that it is there and it is important that investment is targeted at it, especially around Knock airport where there is a strategic development zone. Senator Burke will know that. Investment needs to be made there urgently. That is what people are waiting to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I am concerned that much of what is cited in the plan and many of the projects involve cost-benefit analyses. Cost-benefit analyses certainly need to be carried out but the results of such analyses can be fixed. It depends on what variables are used. What also concerns me is that this plan is population driven. If one of the main factors in a cost-benefit analysis is population, many of the projects cited in the plan will fail. There needs to be clarity around the variables used in each of the cost-benefit analyses and there needs to be consultation with the local authorities and local communities in developing the criteria. </p>
          <p eId="para_834"> On the amounts made available through the plan, we have been advocating for capital investment for a long time. We know that it results in multiplier effects and that it is the only way forward. However, there is much more money which could be used for this plan and which would be needed. The Minister of State will know this. He talks about the capital envelope, the debt, the decisions that were made by Government and some crazy stuff about everybody telling Europe to go to hell. That does not serve anybody. However, we need to accept the reality of our national debt, which I think is the second highest in the world at €198 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">That costs each citizen in this State approximately €44,000. That is all money which could be used for capital investment and could have been used over the years. Servicing that debt costs between €6 billion and €7 billion every year. We are talking about €60 billion to €70 billion over these ten years which could be available to put vital infrastructure into areas where it is needed. If one looks at savings and money that we give away, we only have to look as far as section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the vulture funds and the tax loopholes available. There is no point in getting hysterical about it. It is absolutely a fact that we are letting billions of euro leave this country and that we are encouraging the likes of vulture funds to come in and to take these tax breaks. These come at the expense of people living in rural Ireland. That is the problem we have with much of this. We need to be heard and the Minister of State needs to listen to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I will comment on the way the plan was launched in the first place. The likes of us in rural Ireland thought it was absolutely ridiculous. All it was short of was dancing girls and some bells and whistles. It gave off the wrong image and overcooked the goose. It involved the strategic communications unit. I agree with the Taoiseach who is coming around to the idea of abolishing it. The use of public money in this regard has to be looked at by the Committee of Public Accounts. That is the only way forward. I worked in media buying and in advertising. I know the difference between an advertorial and an editorial, as do most people. This was put across as editorial. There is no way around it. The Minister of State has to face up to that. </p>
          <p eId="para_838"> There is also no point in passing the buck. When I was instructing media buying agencies and advertising agencies the buck stopped with me. So in this case it stops with the Minister. We need to get to the bottom of that and we need to see how taxpayers' money is being spent. The way in which the regional newspapers were used in this regard was also quite despicable. We all know that newspapers are quite vulnerable as it is. The promise that there is more to come does not fill us in rural Ireland with confidence when we see money being wasted like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> Another aspect of it is that so much of the plan had been announced already. I now see that there are announcements of announcements. I nearly burst out laughing when I read in the newspaper during the week that we are expecting an announcement. We now are told when announcements are expected as well as being given the announcements themselves. To look at an example of what is cited in the plan we waited for 40 years for the Belmullet sewerage scheme. It is now nearly completed because of the work of the EPA and because of European directives saying that it was breaking down and so on. We certainly welcome the project but it was first to receive €13 million in funding which was then cut down to €6 million. It was vastly descaled. It has been put into the national development plan when it is already done. So much more of the plan is regurgitated announcements.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> It is awfully important that this plan is put on a statutory basis. Will the Minister of State clarify the legal aspects and whether there will be a vote in the Dáil and the Seanad in order to put this plan on a statutory footing? I am delighted to see that the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, was made a billionaire overnight. There will be huge expectations in rural Ireland, and in counties such as my own county of Mayo, that he will deliver. We have no doubt that the R312 connecting Erris to Castlebar, which we have waited almost 40 years for, will be delivered.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">I will take the opportunity to talk about Tramore, Waterford and the south east. In that regard, there is a lot to like in the published plan with Waterford being recognised as the capital of the south east and as an urban centre with huge potential for job creation. The north quays strategic development zone regeneration project offers the prospect of a serious injection of new life into the city of Waterford, as well as the improvement of our public infrastructure and transport services and the harnessing of significant new green energy resources. I have full confidence in the CEO of our local authority, Michael Walsh, and his team to ensure that this development is carried out to the benefit of the people of Waterford, of the region and, in turn, of the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> I also want to particularly highlight the commitment to the linking up of the Waterford Greenway with Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and the city centre. Members of the Green Party in Waterford have long advocated for this. I ask that the Minister of State go even further and deliver greater linkages with a blueway along the River Suir in Waterford, which passes Cheekpoint, Passage East, Dunmore East and then goes on the Tramore and the Copper Coast. We have a huge and great resource such as we see with the Great Western Greenway on the west coast. We have a great coastal environment in Ireland and the south east really has something to offer which would not only deliver for rural areas, but also provide great opportunities for tourism. We believe that such a connection would be a very positive development and would go some way to spreading the benefits of the Waterford Greenway to areas that have not enjoyed them so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">One other aspect of the plan is the status of Waterford Institute of Technology. The plan states that the objective is the development and expansion of the city's third level institution and integration with the city and region. Reference is also made to the proposals for the creation of a technological university. Where will that be located? Could it be located in Waterford city? With the infrastructural changes proposed in the project, it seems like common sense that Waterford and the extensive Waterford Institute of Technology campus would have primary consideration. The Minister of State might be aware that we have been working with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to seek to amend the proposal contained in the Technological Universities Bill as I believe as currently configured, the eligibility criteria for new universities is too lax and would constitute a dilution in standards for our university sector. I have been supported in this view by very many senior academics from existing universities who agree that the definition of research students as laid out in the Bill is entirely new and foreign. How we can offer up the new technological universities as serving a role as hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship for the regions if they are not to aim for higher standards than the current constituent parts? This is really important because there is no point in having a branding exercise with these technological universities. They must be of the highest standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> The sustainable development goals, SDGs, are noted at the beginning of Project Ireland 2040. This is an important aspect of the framing of the project. The SDGs constitute a comprehensive vision not just for Irish society but also for Ireland's place on the global stage. The agreement includes clear targets and indicators against which we must measure our progress. I am disappointed that the SDGs are not mainstreamed throughout this document as they relate to almost every aspect of what is set out in Project Ireland 2040. It would involve using one framework along with the Project Ireland 2040 framework to provide synergy and add value to the document. I believe that one of the key ways we can ensure that Project Ireland 2040 is coherent with the broader aims of the SDGs is through the processes of public procurement. We must make full use of the scope that is available within European procurement laws to include environmental, social and health clauses in tenders and contracts and to promote the highest standards in labour law. I would ask the Minister of State to indicate his intentions regarding public procurement clauses and their use in the achievement of the broader aims of SDGs.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Marine spatial planning has received considerable consideration in Project Ireland 2040, which is to be welcomed. This is one area of the plan I was excited to see. It finally provides greater certainty for those engaged in harnessing our coastal natural resources in a sustainable manner. Marine spatial planning is an important approach to ensuring that such activities take place in a co-ordinated and careful manner, which allows for future generations to enjoy these opportunities and preserves the often delicate ecological balance of our coastal region. With that in mind, I met the Bantry Bay kelp forest campaign group at the gates of Leinster House today. They have been appealing to the Government against the decision for a potentially unsustainable mechanical harvesting of kelp seaweed that is scheduled to take place in Bantry Bay. No environmental impact statement has been carried out in respect of this project. This harvesting decision is partly as a result of our out-of-date, unfair and unsustainable foreshore licensing system, a system that has been decried in here and in the Dáil today. We see the cross-border damage done by legal and illegal trawling while small producers are excluded from the market by inflexible and unfair rules. I know that the Government has been talking about changes to the foreshore licensing system for many years now but I want to know what progress has been made on this front and how will it fit in with the plans for a full marine spatial plan for Ireland as a member of the EU. Trying to get a foreshore licence as a small business is next to impossible. </p>
          <p eId="para_851"> This is the eve of International Women's Day 2018. I hope that by the time this plan reaches fruition, we will see a 50% gender balance here in the Irish Parliament in both the Seanad and the Dáil. </p>

          <p eId="para_852">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for being here for this debate because it is very important. He outlined clearly the success he had in the projects that had been identified as important for Limerick and rightly so. Likewise, I make no apologies for fighting for the projects I think are important for my own area in Cork. There is much good news for Cork. It is not just about looking at Cork. It is about looking at the entire Munster region and the need to change the growth patterns and to make sure we do not continue with the expansion of Dublin and leave other areas behind. This is what the national development plan is doing. It is about making sure that areas like Limerick, Cork and Waterford develop and that the necessary infrastructure is put in place for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> A number of key projects in Cork are included in this programme. In respect of the development of the Port of Cork, it is one of the best harbours in the world and its development is extremely important. It is fine having a harbour and a port facility through which we can export but we need a road infrastructure to get to it. Part of that infrastructure is the development of the new road from Tivoli to the port itself and the Dunkettle interchange. The Cork-Limerick road or, as the Minister of State would say, the Limerick-Cork road, is an important development as well. The other connection for which I fought very hard is the north link road in Cork city because there is no point in people travelling at 120 km/h from Limerick to Cork and then coming to a stop. There is also an important development in the north link road connecting the Cork-Limerick road to the Cork-Dublin road and connecting the roads servicing the port of Cork. They are all very important. </p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Over the past 30 years, the population of Munster has grown by over 250,000 people. The population of Cork city and county has gone from 410,000 to 542,000. We need to create the necessary hospital facilities. The provision of a new hospital for Cork is included in the development plan. I raised a Commencement matter this morning about the process for identifying a site for this new facility because it is one thing putting it into a plan. The next thing is delivering it. It should not be the case that once the plan is published, we just park it. We all have a part to play in making sure it is delivered. The three key words for me are plan, develop and deliver. This is extremely important for each of these projects. It is important that we also try to set targets for delivery in each of these projects. It has taken 25 years from the time we first talked about the national children's hospital to when we put in the foundations. I do not want this to happen with this project in Cork, which is one of the reasons I will continue to raise this issue until I know the work has started, the development can commence and the project is finally delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I suppose there are other issues in relation to Cork, including road infrastructure, hospital facilities and third level education. The new business school in Cork is an important development in a growing area. As many multinational companies are based in Cork, it is important for such educational supports to be available. I think we have hit all of the right points with regard to the delivery of this plan. We have the plan and now we need to develop it and deliver it. We need to set clear targets for that delivery over the next ten years.</p>

          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_856">I will make some general remarks rather than speaking about specific projects. I could speak about a number of particular projects in the west and the north west, but I will not do so because time is short. Other Senators have referred to the Government's strategic communications unit when speaking about last month's announcement. While that may be linked to the national planning framework, I do not propose to get into it tonight because it is a side issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I welcome the framework because it represents the way forward. It is a good initiative that deserves buy-in from Members of the Oireachtas of all political parties and none. When the national spatial strategy was announced in 2002, it was not accompanied by a capital plan. It was probably a mistake that after the spatial strategy was published, it took four years for the capital plan to come into place. Within two or three years of the capital investment being provided in 2006, public investment had reduced to 2.5% of this country's economic output. We are now back at 4% in accordance with the €116 billion that is proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> My concern with regard to the Government's announcement of a €116 billion plan is that every Minister and Deputy, particularly on the Government side, is trying to launch it, claim credit for it in some way and say that the money is available for these projects. I am not saying this as a political point because the same thing would happen if Fianna Fáil was in government. We are looking at it the wrong way around. The money announcement is one thing, but announcing money does not deliver the project on the ground and does not deliver value for money in these projects. I will explain what could happen here - I am not suggesting that it will - by reminding the House of what happened in recent decades. I refer, for example, to the national children's hospital project, to the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel or to various bypasses here and there. I have looked at the cost-benefit analyses that were carried out on some of those projects and they are shocking, to say the least. The development of the port tunnel was a disaster. At the moment, the children's hospital project is running over budget and the taxpayer will have to carry the cost burden. It will probably cost twice what it was originally going to cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> I will explain my fears in this regard. In 2013, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced new guidelines as part of the public spending code, under which capital projects must be analysed and evaluated in a certain way. I have read the national planning framework online. I got the copy today that Senator Horkan referred to. I am worried that there is no mention in the framework of the public spending code or of the need for value for money in the delivery of these projects. For example, it is proposed to spend €3 billion on the metro north project, which was publicised heavily when the announcement was made in Sligo on Friday, 16 February last. Neither the first nor the second cost-benefit analysis of the project showed that the benefits would outweigh the costs. I understand from media reports that a third cost-benefit analysis is being carried out. The objective of this third analysis must be to provide the results wanted by the Government in order to be able to deliver the project. I think we are going down a road that will not necessarily deliver value for the money the taxpayer is investing in these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> I would like draw the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to a recent International Monetary Fund report on projects across the OECD. I have read some, but not all, of the report, which highlights this country and makes 27 recommendations on public investment in infrastructure in Ireland. The recommendations relate to planning, appraisal, evaluation, the public spending code, how projects are selected and how money is earmarked and spent. Will those recommendations be considered and used before any money is spent under this plan? I do not expect the Minister of State to give me an answer to that question tonight. I would like a detailed response to it in writing, perhaps from the senior Minister. It was a mistake not to give both Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity to vote on the national planning framework. This was covered in a line of the legislation that was brought through the Houses to amend the Planning and Development Acts. We should have an opportunity not just to debate the framework, but to vote on it. We are going to support it anyway, but we should have an opportunity to vote on it as democrats.</p>

        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2018-03-07T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_861">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta O'Donovan. It was damaging for Fine Gael to go along with the best efforts of the Government's spin unit by engaging in self-promotion in an attempt to dupe the country and its people. I have no problem in saying that this unit, which is too slick for its own good, is paid for by the public. People are aware that the funding for the unit is taken from the public purse. I do not think anybody can deny that this is what has happened. The national development plan is full of many pre-announced worthwhile projects. The national children's hospital, in my area of Dublin South-Central, is an example of a worthwhile project that has been announced on several occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> I want to concentrate firstly on the section of the plan dealing with climate change and climate action, which is probably the most important priority issue of our time and one of the biggest threats to our future. We know the Government will have to pay heavy fines for missing our EU 2020 climate action commitments. Its apathy to climate change is having an impact on our health. In recent years, the World Health Organization, WHO, has strongly stated that everything that goes with climate deterioration, including pollution, displacement of people due to famines and wars and sea pollution, is having a significant impact on our health. According to the WHO, it is known that at least 15 million or 16 million people around the world die as a result of climate deterioration each year. This problem has the capacity to roll back 50 years of advances in public health. If we do not act to protect our climate, we could see the return of measles and plagues, etc. We need to get to grips with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I would like to focus on the simple idea of electric vehicles. The national development plan has set a target of 500,000 electric vehicles by 2030. We have just over 2,000 such vehicles at the moment. There are 1.9 million private cars on our roads. There are no specific proposals for how the 2030 target is to be achieved. There is uncertainty with regard to who is going to build and own the public charging infrastructure. The regulator has recommended that ESB Networks should no longer have this responsibility. The target I have mentioned has financial implications for consumers. How will they be assisted to make the switch?</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> The national development plan does not include any specific plans for establishing particular energy sources to replace fossil fuels. We have virtually been completely reliant on onshore wind for our renewable energy. It is vital that we establish a wide portfolio of renewable energy sources. The plan mentions some other sources, but it does not set out any specific details of how they will be established. Biogas, which is a sustainable form of gas produced from farm waste, is mentioned in the plan but no details are provided with regard to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">We need a detailed plan for how to increase our usage of environmentally friendly biogas. Sinn Féin has published a policy paper on this issue which I invite the Minister of State to flick through. I welcome reports that Bord na Móna will not proceed with the plan to build a €60 million biomass plant in the United States to develop wood chip to be burnt in Irish electricity power plants. To import biomass rather than growing it here makes no sense from an environmental or local jobs perspective. Although biomass by itself is not the solution to all of our energy needs, it can form part of a wide portfolio of energy sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The national development plan announced that the Government intends to fund energy research into solar energy or biogas. Those are well-established sources of power worldwide and we do not need to conduct research into them but, rather, to use them. It is disappointing that the hundreds of millions of euro we face in potential fines will stymie the development of the infrastructure to combat climate change and limit our resources. </p>

          <p eId="para_888">All the best people have roots in County Mayo. I rise to support Project Ireland 2040. I welcome it as a blueprint whereby we can chart our way to 2040, meet the challenges of population growth and rebalance economic activity in the country, which will be key in terms of rebalancing population. By doing that and taking a holistic approach, rural Ireland and what it has to offer will be part of the solution. This document provides an opportunity through funding and initiatives for rural Ireland to progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> As has been stated on several occasions, this is the first time that money to back up such a plan has been available. The last national spatial strategy was a disappointment for many towns such as Ballina and Castlebar. It did not deliver because there was no money to back it up and intervening political decisions meant its proposals never saw the light of day in some parts of the country, which contributed to the divide which now exists. However, there is now an opportunity to address that divide. The plan refers to and includes every region and all regions will benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> I am particularly pleased by the top-line items included for Mayo. There will be far more such projects but the highlight is Ireland West Airport Knock, which is an issue on which I have campaigned for several years. I am thrilled that, having met the Taoiseach on the issue, he is giving a commitment to Knock and that has been provided for in the national development plan. That is the first time it has been given such status and significance, notwithstanding the many years it has been in existence, because it operates as a trust and was created not by the State but, rather, by the people of Mayo and the diaspora. That has counted against it in terms of state aid rules but I hope its strategic importance has been underlined by its recognition in the plan and that that confirms the commitment of the Government to capital projects or development that will take place there, which I have no doubt will grow the airport and make it sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I wish to voice my concern at a radio interview given on Clare FM by Deputy Timmy Dooley, a Front Bench spokesperson for Fianna Fáil who was not too impressed with the inclusion of Ireland West Airport Knock in the national planning framework and the national development plan. He described it as a small, peripheral airport and did not seem to recognise its significance or that it has been operating very efficiently for the past number of years with minimal investment from the taxpayer compared to other national airports such as Shannon, which had a debt of €100 million written off and for which special initiatives are being undertaken to bring more industry and development to its surrounding area. I assure the Acting Chairman that this is not personal, but I wish to know the Fianna Fáil position on Knock airport as I am somewhat confused in that regard.</p>
