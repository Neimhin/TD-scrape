          <p eId="para_11">The first item today is the report on pension charges in Ireland. I welcome officials from the Department of Social Protection: Ms Patricia Murphy, principal officer, pensions and carers policy unit, and Mr. Robert Nicholson, assistant principal. I also welcome Mr. Andrew Nugent from the Pensions Board, Mr. Joe Morley from the Central Bank and Mr. Niall McGrath from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to the following. By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I advise the witnesses that their opening statements will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now invite Ms Murphy to make her opening remarks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Ms Patricia Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">I thank the committee for its invitation to present the findings of the report on pension charges. The committee will have received copies of my speaking note. Copies of the report have also been provided to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> My name is Patricia Murphy and I am the principal officer in the pensions policy section of the Department of Social Protection. I am accompanied by Mr. Robert Nicholson, assistant principal, pensions policy, Mr. Andrew Nugent, assistant head of policy at the Pensions Board, Mr. Joe Morley from the Central Bank and Mr. Niall McGrath from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who provided support in the report's preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The report was requested by the Minister for Social Protection to gather information on the levels of pension charge levied on private and occupational pension arrangements for the purpose of assessing whether charges are reasonable and transparent, and to report on the findings and make recommendations, as appropriate, to the Minister and the Government. This is the first comprehensive Government report on the subject. The work was led by the Department of Social Protection with a steering group that included representatives from the Pensions Board and the Central Bank. Assistance throughout was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> A primary objective of the research was to undertake a fact-finding exercise on the charging structures that apply across the various pension arrangements and provide an insight into the breakdown of charges and costs relating to pension provision in Ireland, with the goal of enhancing the understanding of the impact of such charges on the investments of pension scheme members and policy holders. The scope of the research focused on costs arising during the pension saving cycle from initial set-up to the point of retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In undertaking the research, pension arrangements were divided into two main categories: employer-sponsored pension arrangements, which included defined benefit schemes, defined contribution insured schemes, defined contribution non-insured schemes, and public sector AVC schemes; and individual pension arrangements, such as retirement annuity contracts, executive or one-man pension plans, standard personal retirement savings accounts, and buy-out bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"><b>
						</b>Pension charges can be broadly categorised as disclosed or non-disclosed, which also is implicit. Disclosed charges vary in nature and include items such as an annual management charge, allocation rate, policy fee, bid-offer spread, exit fee and cost of commission distribution. Non-disclosed implicit charges relate to underlying costs of investment management, such as custodianship fees. These types of additional cost will have an impact on long-term pension values to differing degrees and are not typically disclosed to individual pension savers.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> During the research, questionnaires were issued to the following: occupational pension scheme trustees, for those pension arrangements where trustees are in place, with 340 out of 1,015 responding; life assurance companies, for those pension arrangements in which life assurance companies were the predominant provider, with 12 out of 14 providers responding; investment management, with 8 out of 9 responding; and pension advisers, who often provide the link between trustees, employers and individuals and pension providers, with 37 out of 60 responding.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> With regard to conclusions, the report highlights a wide range of issues with regard to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems. It is recognised that the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost-free. It is also clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency. </p>
          <p eId="para_22"> On reasonableness, the report concludes that there is a considerable variation in the range of charges imposed. Some schemes and individuals appear to be paying more than they need to. Smaller occupational pension schemes and individual pension arrangements appear to be comparatively expensive. A member of a defined contribution scheme with a final pension fund of €400,000 could lose up to 15%, or €60,000, in charges. An individual with a final pension fund of €400,000 could lose up to 30%, or €120,000, in charges. The research indicated that, as a rule of thumb, every 0.25% increase in the reduction in yield, which is the annual cost of all charges applied to the fund, results in a decrease of 4% in the final projected value of the pension fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> With regard to transparency, the report concludes that there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in current practices and a culture of providing clear information in a simple manner is not evident. It also concluded that improvements in disclosure requirements, including those for pensions, were introduced in the Central Bank's 2012 consumer protection code and these should enhance transparency for those consumers covered by the code. There are also various ongoing developments at EU level which should lead to stronger consumer protection over time. The report may also be of interest to other agencies that have a role in market regulation and consumer protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Developments on broader pensions policy could also have a significant impact given that the research clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges. For example, the proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The research also observed that the number of occupational pension schemes with legacy pension charging structures is small. A key finding is that scheme review and amendment, known as re-brokering, is significant in the case of occupational pension schemes and is also relatively common in individual pension arrangements. </p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The practice of applying commission is prevalent in defined contribution insured schemes but is particularly widespread within individual pension arrangements. There is no standardised approach to providing information on the impact of commission payments and the research shows that the various approaches used will affect members differently depending upon circumstances - for example, their age and period to retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The recommendations in the report are principally focused on what can be achieved relatively quickly by improving regulation and best practice in disclosure. A summary of the recommendations is set out on pages 19 and 20 of the report and include the following proposals: develop approaches to improve consumer, employer and trustee awareness and knowledge of pension charges, which should ensure that information is clear and concise, with charges standardised where possible and based on best practice; develop a communications action plan on pension charges; review occupational pension disclosure regulations specifically to provide for the issuing of an annual statement to all deferred members, improve the information provided in the statement of reasonable projection, and review the need for focused detail; monitor developments and continue efforts to develop a single standard measure that would assess all costs and charges and thereby enable easier comparisons to be made; continue to monitor the implementation of the 2012 consumer protection code; conduct further research on the drivers behind consumer choice of individual pension products, with particular reference to PRSAs; ensure data on charges is collected on a periodic basis, with three-yearly intervals considered appropriate; and evaluate the impact of this report, these recommendations and future EU developments after two years and assess whether further and more stringent recommendations are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Individuals and bodies have been given an opportunity to consider the report and its recommendations and respond at the end of January. I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting the Department here today. My colleagues and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">I thank Ms Murphy for her presentation and I commend the people who compiled the report. Obviously it is a large and comprehensive report, but it is a worrying one in some respects. I want to look at the context against which the report has been presented.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">We are dealing with a situation where pension schemes have suffered horrendous losses, regardless of whether they are defined contribution or defined benefit schemes. In many cases, they have been very badly managed. Practically every defined benefit scheme in the country is underwater, yet the committee stated: "A member of a defined contribution scheme with a final pension fund of €400,000 could lose up to 15% or €60,000 on charges. [That is not the best of it.] An individual with a final pension fund of €400,000 could lose up to 30% or €120,000". According to the speaking note, there are two types of charge, the ones that are up front and those which are hidden. In the context of a business that has already been fleeced by charges and is also underwater financially, why should there be hidden charges? Surely, one would expect all charges to be out in the open at this time, especially given the context in which we are speaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The committee that put the report together appears to have been concentrating on achieving transparency in the hope that if people knew what was happening, what other people were charging and so forth, it would encourage competition and thereby drive down prices. I will make two comments in that regard. First, I realise this is just a report of the recommendations, but much of the content of the recommendations is about monitoring, developing approaches and schemes, reviewing, conducting further research and so forth. There is a glaring lack of urgency, even though we are dealing with an urgent and critical issue. Second, are we not considering the possibility of not only bringing all these charges into the open but also of imposing some limits on the amount people can charge for managing pension funds? We should be examining that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> There are a few other matters that worry me, for example, the reference to the great solution or the white knight to come to the rescue, that is, the auto-enrolment scheme. Frankly, we are light years away from an auto-enrolment scheme. Look at the current situation and the reports from organisations such as the Irish League of Credit Unions which show that people have approximately €50 in disposable cash left each month after paying their bills. One could enrol any number of people onto the auto-enrolment scheme, but they would all opt out again simply because they would not be able to live. In view of the broad economic position, anything that takes more money out of the economy at this stage will be a non-runner.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Obviously, there is a great deal of work to be done in this regard. However, my focus would be on getting everything out in the open in simple and easy to understand terminology and, second, imposing some limits on the amount people can charge for their services. Some of these services have not performed too well, judging by the results.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_34">I welcome the report. It is an issue that has annoyed many people who, when considering their pension, have an idea about how much they will hopefully receive when they avail of it and are suddenly confronted with charges, hidden charges and whatnot. There is a great deal of work ahead of us in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> There is a series of recommendations. There is also the issue of changes that have been introduced in the Central Bank legislation and possibly other legislative changes. Can some of the recommendations and changes be imposed retrospectively or do they only apply to all new pensions? The difficulty for us, as legislators, is that we are told we cannot apply something once somebody has signed a contract, even when that contract contains hidden charges. Some of the changes mentioned are quite simple and I hope the industry will agree to and adopt them on a voluntary basis. If not, can it be forced to disclose in full the fees and charges that have remained hidden from its customers? This is particularly relevant nowadays when people are trying to decide whether they should continue to contribute to a pension fund. Many people are in dire straits and if they see that the final figure is much lower than they anticipated, they might pull out. Some of them are putting themselves under a great deal of financial strain just to continue making payments in the hope of receiving a pension at the end of it. It is similar to the health insurance issue. People continue to make the payments because they have paid in for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The glossary associated with the report is longer than the recommendations, which is an example of how complicated it is. It is not an area in which I have expertise. I will definitely go through the report to tease out a few more questions as the changes and recommendations are progressed. There is a degree of urgency about this, but we must also ensure we get it right, especially if the Minister, as she has said, is moving towards auto enrolment. Again, that is a separate pension scheme and it will have its own fees and charges, but, because the State will be involved, they will be up-front and above board. Perhaps that will also force the industry to try to compete with that new model. It is not one with which I fully agree, but if it is going to be put in place, it will have to be a model that will make the private industry reach its target. There is a job of work to be done in that regard. The report is well done.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Ms Patricia Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">I thank the Deputies for their comments on the report, the scope and purpose of which are really fact finding. We acknowledge the issue is very complex and the length and detail of the report reflect the topic dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> A number of points were made by the Deputies. With regard to implicit charges, it is acknowledged in the report in respect of the non-disclosed element of the charges that it would be helpful if in the future some consistent way of providing for these charges could be determined. On the recommendations, their focus was on what actions could be taken reasonably quickly to promote transparency. The lack of transparency was seen as one of the major difficulties. The recommendations focused on identifying gaps in the existing disclosure regulations to provide more information for scheme members and on looking at how the consumer protection code, introduced last year by the Central Bank, was operating with regard to providing more complete and full information for consumers in order that they could see what charges they were paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> The issue of price regulation is discussed in the report. The view of the steering group was that initiatives to promote transparency might be more successful at promoting competition initially, but if that was not seen to work, perhaps more stringent action might be taken. PRSAs have their price fixed by regulation, but that price effectively operates as a maximum. One of the recommendations made in the report is that we look at how they are operating for consumers who might need them. Also, the consultation is just coming to an end and we will be looking at the submissions that arrive and reverting back to the Minister and the Government for their views about the implementation of the recommendations made.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I welcome the panel. This is a fine report. The level of charges is madness and I concur with the comments of Deputy O'Dea. Why is there such a difference? Both levels of charges are huge. Why is there such a difference between 30% on individual pension schemes and 15% on occupational pension schemes? Is it because occupational pension schemes are doing more of the work?</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> What can we do to reduce these costs? The panel has made a number of recommendations on transparency. How can an individual find out if he or she is paying too much? With regard to the report's recommendations, who must carry these out? Is it the underwriter of the pension scheme, such as Irish Life or Standard Life? In what way do these companies liaise with the Minister for Social Protection?</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The panel surveyed quite a few groups to produce this report. Did the possibility arise of taking out money from pensions funds to help individuals meet current commitments? Did it come up as an add-on comment? The panel may not have been looking for a view on it but may have heard it raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Ms Murphy referred to not collecting set information on commission structures, yet there is a clear question on page 263: "What factors typically influence the type of commission structures you typically choose for such pension arrangements?" The panel asked a very clear question on PRSAs, personal retirement bonds, executive pensions, approved retirement funds and groups. What were the findings and what is the level of commission? It used to be very high, 60% on a personal pension fund. I am keen to get answers to help people who have decided, in the case of individual schemes, to invest in these pension funds. Anyone with an occupational pension scheme has no choice but to invest.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">On a point related to the matters raised by Deputy O'Dea and Senator Healy Eames, is the industry in Ireland making super-normal profits? How does the industry in Ireland compare with international standards? It does not appear to be covered in the report. Perhaps the witnesses can address this point if they have covered it in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> With regard to the potential levy on funds, as public policy a 0.6% levy was applied to the pensions industry by the Government to fund jobs initiatives. What flexibility do pension schemes have in respect of how they apply the levy? I refer to the pension scheme of the airline based in the middle of my constituency. People have received letters to say that the funds have not applied the 0.6% levy over the past two years but it is their intention to apply a 1.2% levy on those funds permanently. In terms of the flexibility of schemes to do such things, it seems to be against the thrust of the intention of the levy. I am interested in the comments of the panel in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">On that point, it has been said to me that some companies seem to charge the pension fund levy to customers. I am not sure if this is when the person received the pension payment or when the person receives notice of charges but it was noted on a slip received by the person. Has the panel examined the allocation of the pension levy and whether this is being done fairly? Has the panel come across cases where the levy seems to be charged to individual customers? The person who mentioned it to me anecdotally suggested it was being described as a Government levy the customer was paying.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I will respond to the questions in order. With regard to the difference in price between the occupational schemes and individual arrangements, the cost is split in occupational schemes between employers and individual members. What comes through from the findings is that individual arrangements are more expensive. Some of that can relate to scale because one of the key findings of the report is that the bigger the employer, the lower the cost. For an individual, costs will be higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> With regard to transparency, and the question of how an individual can find out if he or she is paying too much, it is quite difficult. Asking questions of the adviser is critical. The report wanted to set out the facts in this area and to present information. We used a reduction in yield to quantify costs. Someone dealing with the scheme can ask about the reduction in yield in respect of the arrangement the person is in and can then make a comparison in terms of how they fare on the variability of charges that apply.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">Is there a responsibility on the pension company to let the individual know the charges? If the customer finds out he or she is paying too much, he or she can claim it back.

          <p eId="para_50">The consumer protection code, which the Central Bank introduced in 2012, has a requirement on insurance companies to provide an annual statement to the individuals indicating the opening balance, the moneys paid, the number of units held and all charges and deductions affecting the investment product.

          <p eId="para_52">The statement provides information. The consumer should interact with the adviser who sold the product to provide ongoing advice. The adviser will be able to help out on that point. The statement will provide the charges. Initially, the person should have been given a list of charges in the policy although there is a gamut of charges. This goes some of the way to assist people to compare charges with what they were sold originally. This point is in the new consumer protection code.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The possibility of taking sums of money from the fund was not within the scope of the report. I do not have been any information on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> With regard to the regulatory structure and who asks questions about occupational schemes, this is the responsibility of trustees who manage the schemes. They work with the employers and they must ask the questions of the providers or advisers. In the case of the individual, the individual takes on the burden and queries the intermediary or adviser he or she is dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The schemes are regulated by the Pensions Board and providers are regulated by the Central Bank. </p>
          <p eId="para_56"> In response to the question on commission, we looked extensively at rates of commission throughout the report. We looked at how often this arises and found it was less prevalent in occupational schemes. In defined contribution schemes that are managed by the life assurance sector, commission is prevalent in 39% of policies and costs can vary, with initial commission ranging from 1% to 20% for up-front commission, and renewal commission ranging from 1% to 5%, averaging out at 2.8%. Commission on funds averages out at 0.5%. Commission is much more prevalent in individual arrangements and the up-front commission in this instance was 25% generally, with commission of 1% to 5% on renewal or recurring policies and a trade up-front commission of 0.5% on larger arrangements. Commission is a higher cost in the individual arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">Ms Murphy flagged a number of concerns that I think the Minister should act on. First, in my view the consumer code should provide information not only on the charges that are being applied but on what should have been charged. It is not good enough to tell people what they were charged; it should give information on what they should have been charged to see whether they paid too much. One is not really informing the customer. The purpose of a consumer code is to empower the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Second, I am not clear on the issue of commission. Was a standardised commission applied across the same product, as should have been the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I will deal with the question on commission. One of the findings of the report is that there was no universal approach to reflecting commission. With regard to individual products, I am not quite sure of the situation. One would need to examine the original raw data. The general conclusion was that there was no universal approach across products.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> In response to the Senator's assertion that consumers should know precisely what they are paying for, I might ask Mr. Joe Morley from the Central Bank to comment further. One of the findings of the report was that there was no clear link between charges and the actual service being provided. That was part of the transparency issue - one could not necessarily tell precisely what one was paying for. Some of that is being dealt with in the consumer code.</p>

What we have done this year is to introduce the statement. Consumers would have been provided originally with the charges on the product.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">Certainly, companies are supposed to include the charges in the documentation at the commencement of a product. I accept it can be difficult for the consumer to make a comparison across other services but we found that out as part of the review. What we have tried to do is to introduce the statement so that the consumer can see, at the end of each year, information on the charges - information that was not previously provided. The situation currently is that all consumers get a current balance at the end of each year. This new statement will actually show what is going on during the year. It is something the Central Bank intends to examine during the year to ensure that statements in the agreed format are being issued. In cases in which a consumer had dealt with an intermediary, the consumer would be able to go back through the intermediary, who is subject to our code and has a responsibility to sell suitable products to the individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">If the intermediary is not in business, there is nothing to stop a consumer from going to a new adviser who can help him or her out. That is still an opportunity. We have placed a requirement on firms to provide information on the statement. If firms are charging for items that are not on the original contract, we will have to investigate it. In such a case, in the first instance the person should make a complaint to the firm or to go to the Ombudsman.

We will be investigating them this year to ensure that statements are being issued and see exactly how they are approaching the section on charges.

          <p eId="para_82">That comes under the remit of the Minister for Finance and I have very limited information on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> In the context of the position internationally, the situation in the UK was examined when the report was being compiled in order to see how Ireland compares. The findings in the report indicate that our occupational pension schemes compare quite reasonably with those in the UK in the context of costs. However, they also show that individual arrangements are likely to be more expensive than in the UK. The latter is currently moving to the NEST pension scheme and the charge relating to this is very low. On the occupational side, costs can generally be reasonable when compared to those in the UK. On the individual side, however, they are expensive.</p>

On the defined contribution schemes, the comparator we used was the reduction in yield and this is 0.45% to 0.9%. The reduction in yield relating to the UK stakeholder pension is 1% to 1.63%. The typical charging structure for standard PRSAs is 1.27% to 1.57%. These are closer to the UK stakeholder pension and both are slightly less.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The point I made earlier is also relevant in that regard. It has been done for PRSAs. Ultimately, the difficulty with fixing a price is that it becomes the actual price and perhaps reduces competition. These are the points that are made in the report. The report also recommends that PRSAs - and how they fared - should be considered in greater detail. That would be helpful. Obviously, however, that would be a decision for the Minister and the Government to make in the context of policy in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">The report recommends that a regime of transparency be imposed in respect of schemes. When a person signs up to a contract, those in the industry often state that transparency is fine with regard to new products. Does Ms Murphy expect the industry to take the recommendations on board or can they be imposed on it? When voluntary codes were introduced in the past, they were not always complied with. Anything that makes the position in respect of charges and fees more transparent would be welcome. If a person has been signed up to a pension scheme for the past ten, 20 or 30 years, he or she may wish to work out whether he or she should continue to pay into it or whether there will be a huge drop in the amount he or she will receive annually upon retirement.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Any amendment of the occupational schemes would certainly involve changes to regulations, as proposed in the report. This would mean they would have to be complied with and that they would also apply to existing members of schemes in order to bring them up to date in their information. So I suppose the answer is that one should get simple, straightforward and understandable information on the amounts one is paying now and on how these will ultimately be reflected in one's pension.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I was making a contribution in the Seanad so I missed most of the proceedings up to now. I will not pose many questions because I am sure most of the points have been covered. I can read through the transcripts in order to bring myself up to speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> It may not come within the Department's remit, but what is the position with regard to people such as those who worked for Waterford Glass, who paid contributions to a pension scheme but were then left high and dry? Do such individuals have any comeback? Major charges are being imposed. Will Ms Murphy indicate what these cover? Do they have any impact on the people to whom I refer? Others to whom I have spoken have paid into pension funds for many years and are about to retire. They are concerned that their pensions will not be there when they seek to access them. I accept that those on defined benefit schemes should get a certain amount back but they are concerned that their employers do not have the money necessary to pay their pensions. If the company for whom one of these people works goes bust, what will happen to his or her pension?</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I wish to ask a couple of questions. If the pension levy were being treated as though it were a charge on individuals who are paying into a pension fund, would that be appropriate or legal? A great deal of our interaction in respect of this matter is with pensioners or people who are paying into pension funds rather than with those in the industry. Ms Murphy referred to surveys of trustees, etc. Has the Department consulted individual customers? Were such customers involved in the subsequent consultation process? In the context of State agencies such as the ESB, could more be done to ensure that people who pay into their pension funds are not being overcharged and that these funds are being properly run? The State has a role in respect of those agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">The Chairman's first point relates to the pension levy. To my knowledge, the legislation allows for the levy to be dealt with and it is the responsibility of the trustees of individual schemes to decide how the levy is imposed. This matter falls outside my particular remit but that is the position as I understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> We were not in a position to contact or consult individual customers in the context of compiling the report. However, information was obtained from the trustees who manage the schemes on behalf of their members. We carried out our research on individual pension arrangements with providers, life assurance companies and intermediaries. The consultation process is open so individuals can make submissions or any kind of response they wish to us. We would certainly welcome such submissions or responses.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">I welcome representatives of Pavee Point for our discussion of the habitual residence condition: Ms Ronnie Fay, director, Ms Gabi F.

          <p eId="para_115"> I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and he or she continues to do so, that witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statements the witnesses submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses.

          <from> Ms Ronnie Fay<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_116">Pavee Point is delighted to have the opportunity to make this presentation on issues with regard to social protection for the Roma community living in Ireland. We have a long track record of working on Traveller and Roma issues both in Ireland and at a European level since our foundation in 1985. We have had a dedicated Roma project since 2000. Today we will focus on the impact of the habitual residence condition on the Roma community in Ireland, and my colleague Ms Siobhan Curran will outline the actions we would like to see happen to address the concerns we will outline. Ms Gabi Muntean will outline her personal experience and the consequences for Roma community members who cannot access social protection in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Pavee Point is not naive and does not suggest that Ireland should be responsible for resolving the problems of all the Roma living in the European Union. We propose that the Government take both a humanitarian and a pragmatic approach in addressing the concerns of the Roma living in Ireland that we will highlight. We believe there is a need for an European-wide co-ordinated approach in addressing Roma issues and we welcome the European framework for national Roma integration strategies. However, it is most unfortunate that the Irish Government has totally ignored the existence of the Roma community living in Ireland and Roma are invisible in the Irish strategy. The mindset of the State appears to be one of ignoring the Roma community and hoping its members will go away. The reality is that Roma are a part of Ireland now and have been since the mid-1990s, and Pavee Point believes that we need to proactively address their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> There are an estimated 12 million to 15 million Roma living in the European Union. Official policies against the Roma during the past 70 years have included containment and forced assimilation, while in the worst period during the Second World War, between a quarter and half a million Roma were exterminated by the Nazi regime. After the Second World War the predominant policy in many states was forced assimilation of Roma. Since the fall of the Communist regimes in eastern Europe in 1989, the situation of Roma has for the most part worsened. With the transition to a market economy, Roma have become increasingly marginalised. Openly anti-Roma attitudes suppressed under Communist systems have re-emerged in more virulent and sometimes violent form. In the first half of 2012 alone, the European Roma Rights Centre highlighted media reports of at least 20 attacks across four countries, including ten deaths of Romani people. The response of authorities to such abuses has often been characterised by a failure to investigate racist crimes, in some cases even blaming the victims, while in others the authorities are the perpetrators. Because many central and eastern European countries continue to fail to address anti-Roma discrimination or provide protection against violent attacks, some Roma seek a better life in western European states, including in Ireland. There are no accurate data on the Roma population in Ireland, as we do not disaggregate data on ethnicity. However, we estimate there are about 5,000 Roma living here.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> We want a humanitarian, pragmatic and common-sense approach to the needs of Roma living in Ireland. Otherwise, the alternative will be the creation of a permanent underclass of Roma where poverty, exclusion and racism are the norm. Resources are being used for negative measures such as policing, criminalisation and hospitalisation rather than positively for Roma development and inclusion. The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, in a report concerning Roma and social security which was published last year, said that Roma are being denied access to services or given reduced assistance, that there is discriminatory application of social assistance programmes and that the use of certain regulations and policies have the effect of rendering Roma ineligible for regular social services.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">We argue that the application of the habitual residence condition, HRC, within Ireland is an example of that kind of discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Pavee Point is also mindful of Ireland's history of emigration and the hostile treatment afforded to the Irish community in both 19th century America and 20th century Britain, when many Irish were forced abroad to seek a better life for themselves and their families. We ask this committee and others in positions of power in Ireland to draw parallels with the way Roma are being treated here.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> We will highlight three key actions which we ask the committee to address. We call on the Department of Social Protection to provide a humanitarian response and to ensure that Roma are not living in extreme poverty without the basics of food and shelter. We call for the provision of targeted training programmes that can be accessed by Roma in Ireland in order to support them in finding employment. We ask for an impact assessment of the habitual residence condition, HRC. Ms Siobhan Curran will describe in more detail some of those actions.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_66">
          <from> Ms Siobhan Curran<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_123">As Ms Ronnie Fay has noted, we wish to bring to the attention of the committee the significant impact of the habitual residence condition. This matter has been raised as a major concern by Roma and by people working in the HSE, the education sector and the wider NGO sector. The HSE in particular is very concerned about the issues facing Roma. To this end, Pavee Point and the HSE organised a number of seminars to discuss the issues facing Roma in Ireland. The major theme at these seminars was that the habitual residence condition is resulting in serious issues of child poverty and destitution for Roma in Ireland. For example, social workers have reported concerns about young babies whose parents have no means to support them. Forced poverty is causing serious child protection issues. Social workers report that they are forced to consider taking a child into care simply to provide access to basic services. Social workers are frustrated that this is the only option for looking after these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Education and welfare officers are also noting the impact of the habitual residence condition on access to education and the ability of Roma parents to send their children to school. There is also a significant health impact. Pavee Point has received reports of Roma who are not entitled to medical cards on the basis that they are unable to provide evidence of means. The HSE has reported that children with serious medical conditions are unable to receive medical cards. Pavee Point receives calls from statutory representatives from Dublin, Galway, Athlone, Limerick, Donegal and from all over the country because of problems encountered in developing responses to the issues facing Roma.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> The effect of the habitual residence condition cannot be under-estimated. For example, a Roma man was claiming entitlements but his payments were cut off because he did not fulfil the habitual residence condition. He became homeless and a few months later he died on the streets of Dublin. The impact of this habitual residence condition is very severe and can be fatal in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I refer to the financial cost of the habitual residence condition. The impact of these policies is bringing Roma into contact with the State in all sorts of different forms. They are dealing with social workers, educational workers, education and welfare officers, the Garda Síochána and the emergency health services. This involves expenditure which could be avoided if people were to be provided with basic financial supports in the first instance rather than allow them fall into destitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> We propose a humanitarian response for Roma who have no access to supports. We need a response urgently to ensure that Roma are not living in destitution. We argue that the Roma in Ireland and across Europe constitute a special case. Roma have experienced discrimination and racism over generations and this has impacted on their access to education, training and employment. We need to develop a response that takes this into account. We suggest that funding be made available for training and supports specifically tailored for Roma so that they can gain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> We ask for an impact assessment to be conducted on the habitual residence condition. Other groups have also called for such an assessment. The special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has also recommended it in her most report in 2012. A proper assessment of the impact of the habitual residence condition is required. We believe these measures would pave the way for the inclusion of Roma in Irish society as well as reflecting a commitment to human rights. As the current holder of the Presidency of the European Union and as a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, this is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership in the area of human rights. </p>
          <p eId="para_129"> My colleague, Ms Gabi Muntean, will speak about the impact of the habitual residence condition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_67">
          <from> Ms Gabi Muntean<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_130">I came to Ireland in 2000. In 2007 I applied for child benefit. I was told I was not habitually resident in Ireland. I had been living in Ireland since 2000. My son and my husband were living with me and I was engaged in a lot of voluntary work. Finally, in 2007, after seven years living in Ireland, I received notice that I was regarded as habitually resident.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I would like the committee to understand how difficult it was for me. My family and I were very insecure because our application was pending. We were not sure if we would be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance from week to week. We were extremely lucky to receive the payment but this is no longer available to others. One week we received no payment and I was terrified. I thought I would be unable to survive in Ireland and I ended up in hospital. It is very hard to go through this experience. One of the biggest worries was that I would be refused child benefit. My son was going to school and I could not afford to buy his uniform, his books or his lunch. I have only one child but many Roma families have three, four, five or seven children. Even with one child I find it very difficult to cope. I ask the committee to imagine how difficult it is for larger families with lots of children. They often cannot cope. Sometimes they are unable to send their children to school. In some cases, parents will send two or three children to school and keep the rest at home. They need support to at least send the children to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Some Roma have no income and they are forced to beg. Begging is not our culture. If they do not beg they will not be able to eat. Children are living in extreme poverty and this is of concern to social workers who take the children away from their families in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> People should not be ignored just because they beg. People have nothing and they have no entitlements. They need to be given support. We should not send people back to places where they may be in danger. Roma need to be supported to find employment. Some Roma are not well educated. They may be illiterate and unable to speak fluent English. These people need to be supported. </p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_134">I thank Ronnie, Gabi and Siobhan for their presentation. It is harrowing to hear Gabi's description of how vulnerable people in our society are affected by decisions. The habitual residence condition is a regulation which details the reasons for excluding people from receiving social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">However, as a society we should also be mindful that there will always be people who fall through the cracks and as a result live in poverty. There are others, not just the Roma community, who fall foul of the habitual residency condition and remain here to survive by whatever means. Those are not just Roma. Many Irish citizens also fall foul of the residency condition. That is one of the reasons this committee is examining how that be changed to ensure it does not prevent people getting some type of safety net payment to help them survive. It is a disgrace if children living in this country cannot at least get child benefit payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> On the number of members of the Roma community living here, the census does not cover that adequately. How does Pavee Point believe we could address that issue? If the numbers were captured properly in the census it would help determine the number of the Roma community that are employed, their ages and so on. That would give it the figures that determine the way Ireland, but also the European Union as a whole, deals with a population which has been discriminated against for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Ms Curran also said Pavee Point has a dedicated Roma programme. How many people go through that programme? What are the plans to increase the number participating? I am aware there was a more vibrant one in the past before some of the changes and cuts were effected but now that there are additional community employment, CE, places available do the witnesses intend to make another submissions to try to build a CE programme specifically on the Roma community and perhaps use that to liaise with the various members of the Roma community? I am aware that in the main they are often concentrated in groups or in families in and around cities. That is as much as I know other than one or two Roma people who have come to my clinic in dire straits where schools have identified the crisis in which their families are living. They have ensured the children can attend school but they are going to school hungry and without adequate clothing and school books. A school I was dealing with, and the parents, managed to intervene and help for a number of months but the community welfare officer was not for turning in one case in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> This is a Europe-wide issue. What specific change do the witnesses believe can be brought about at European level that would help the Roma community access social welfare in the European Union? I do not want to get into the range of human rights issues and so on because we deal with the social welfare issues in this committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I thank the witnesses for their presentation. I am sorry I was delayed. This is an important issue. I get the sense that the Roma people - I understand there are 15 million of them across Europe - are people that nobody wants as a result of which they are poorly treated wherever they go. My understanding is that there are approximately 5,000 Roma in Ireland. Pavee Point has been dealing with this issue for a number of years. What is the witnesses' sense of a national strategy or policy response to the issue of the Roma community, their needs and entitlements? What must be done for them? Is it the case that the State effectively wants the issue to go away or pretend it does not exist? Has anything ever been written down on paper that suggested how to address the wants, needs and requirements of the Roma community?</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Deputy Ó Snodaigh touched on the EU-wide context and that we have the Presidency. Am I right in understanding that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, suggested that one of the priorities for our term is how the EU would tackle this issue? The witnesses might comment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Ireland has reported to the United Nations on our progress this year on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In terms of Roma children being punished because of this State's instinctive distrust - that might be too strong a statement but it probably is accurate - of the Roma community, what implications will that have regarding the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the report the State must make to the UN?</p>

          <from> Ms Siobhan Curran<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_143">I thank the members for their questions and comments. Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the number of Roma and how we address the fact that we do not have accurate statistics. It is clear that in the census, for example, we need to ask a question about Roma and therefore an ethnic identifier should be included on the form. That must happen across all systems including health, education and so on. We must have ethnic identifiers across those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> In the immediate term what could happen is a containable research project where we would map out where Roma are living in Ireland. It is quite easy to do. There are other models that could be followed where people try to get a census of homeless people in Ireland. We could try to map where people are located. We need the funding to do that but if we are to address the issues facing Roma in Ireland we must start developing evidencebased policies which would help us know who is here, where they are located, the needs they are expressing, and their rights. That is the way we develop sensible policies. That is clearly articulated in the common basic principles of the European Union. They outline ten principles on working with Roma, the first of which is on evidence based policy making. Any efforts in that regard and any support from the committee in trying to access the funding or ensuring that is done would be helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The Deputy spoke about the dedicated Roma project in Pavee Point. Unfortunately, we received a cut to our local training initiative which is now gone. That was a local training initiative specifically for training Roma participants. The cut was absolute and therefore the training programme is no longer in operation. People call in regularly to Pavee Point asking about a training programme for Roma in which they can engage. A trust in Pavee Point has been built up over time that we must not lose sight of and must capitalise on because there are Roma people who want to engage with the structure of Pavee Point, and if we had a training programme they would engage with it. </p>
          <p eId="para_146"> We have submitted a proposal to FÁS for a primary health care programme for Roma. The primary health care model for Travellers has been shown to be a success and therefore building on that we submitted a similar funding proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">This was rejected so we are trying to source funding again. We are ready and willing to drive the initiatives but need support.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Much is happening at EU level that allows us to address a few questions. The European Commission has urged all member states to develop a national Roma integration strategy. This is quite momentous in that it is the first time the Commission has explicitly called on member states to develop a co-ordinated response. Member states were to submit their plans by 2011, and Ireland submitted a national Traveller-Roma integration strategy. The document has to include Travellers because they are part of Roma in the European sense. Unfortunately, the strategy contains no timelines, indicators or targets so it ceases to be useable. It excludes Roma. We have a national Traveller-Roma integration strategy that has failed to address the issues the Roma community faces. While the Commission has called for the development of a policy and pressure is being exerted, it is now up to the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure the strategy is up to scratch and reflects what the Commission has called for. One of the key elements is the active participation of Roma.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Let me return to the question of social protection. The strategy should include four key areas, namely, health, accommodation, education and social protection. This is a vehicle to address the issues. It is a really strong vehicle because all European member states have similar initiatives. We need to heed the Commission's views and develop a strong strategy. While we hold the Presidency, we need to show leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, was making a presentation on justice and home affairs last week or the week before. He was quite clear, when questioned about the Roma integration strategy, that it is a priority for the Presidency. He was very clear that racism and discrimination need to be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> With regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we are due to report this year. Issues have been raised in the past about habitual residence conditions, the impact on children and how the status of parents results in differential treatment for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Organisations in addition to mine, including FLAC, have argued that Roma children are being excluded because of the status of their parents. There is a strong argument for addressing this. Furthermore, there are children living in poverty, which contravenes human rights obligations. It is very clear that this is happening and we are hearing it from all quarters. It will be a considerable issue for the committee, and members will be very concerned to hear what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I was asked about difficulties with compliance. There are five criteria that a person must meet to be deemed habitually resident. They all require the provision of a significant amount of evidence to prove a link with Ireland. Difficulties arise for many Roma in terms of language, literacy, etc., but not just in trying to engage with the system. Generally, people who approach Pavee Point are getting assistance but it takes quite a lot of time to take the steps required to be deemed habitually resident. It requires considerable understanding of the documents. Many individuals do not have the documentary evidence to prove their place of residence, for example. If an individual comes here and ends up living with extended family because he may not have other means, he may not necessarily be able to provide a tenancy lease document. These types of issues arise time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Employment constitutes one of the criteria. Many Roma have faced considerable barriers in gaining employment in Ireland. The employment record is affected because it is assessed. Owing to the fact that Roma from Romania or Bulgaria, in particular, needed work permits to work until July 2012, their work records are really affected. It is important to bear in mind that there are those who were simply not allowed to work. That was the <i>de facto</i> result of the work permit regime. When the affected are applying, they do not have the work record that is necessary. There is also a gender element in that women who have been primary carers and who are without an official work record have been affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The issues concern the work record and establishing a link with Ireland. People are asked whether they have a bank account, for example. The questions asked and the thinking surrounding what we are trying to find out are not always suited to various groups. Roma are falling foul of this. We can see the impact, which is extreme poverty. That is what is coming back to us from all quarters.</p>

          <from>Senator Marie Moloney<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_156">I congratulate Pavee Point on its work. Pavee Point is probably one of the best known names in the country. I can assure Ms Curran its reputation extends all over Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Ms Curran referred to a needs policy. In this respect, she is correct. We really need to know who to focus on, where they are and their needs. The habitual residency clause causes problems, not only for the Roma but for everyone. Irish people who were away for a number years but who have returned to care for an elderly relative, for example, are encountering problems owing to the clause. While it presents a difficulty, one must appreciate why it was put in place. The Irish social welfare system has been quite generous. If we did not have such a clause, the floodgates would open. There is no doubt about that. Having said that, the clause does not excuse circumstances in which any child must live in poverty. One should be able to gain access to services.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> If the Roma come to Ireland and cannot gain access to social welfare, how are they living? Have they got supplementary welfare? How do they gain access to accommodation? Unless one has some money coming here, one would find it impossible. How many Roma who have been able to gain access to training have been employed in Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">I apologise for not having been here for the start of the presentation. However, I attended the workshop so I am familiar with the case being made by Pavee Point. I welcome Ms Curran to this meeting to make her case.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Ms Curran made a number of recommendations for the Department of Social Protection. Will amending the guidelines be sufficient or is there a requirement to change the law? I ask that the committee send the recommendations to the policy section of the Department for a specific response on each. Very often, we send a report to the Department and it just lies there. This deserves a specific response.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">With regard to the point made on the role of the Department of Justice and Equality, it might be worth asking the Minister or an official to appear before the committee to explain the changes it is hoped to bring about in Europe, particularly Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">It might be appropriate at that stage to ask about census figures or a specific programme to map where the Roma community lives, poverty levels and what is preventing their access to employment and proper housing. The committee can ascertain this information by letter to the Department of Justice and Equality or get an official to attend the committee as we have the EU Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> On the habitual residence condition, HRC, I have had many dealings with people from the common travel area who are resident in this State but who have been affected by trying to prove their centre of interest is now in this State. There is much backwards and forwards with Traveller families between here and England. They often move for several weeks, sometimes for several years, between the two jurisdictions, whether it is in the North or England. How has the imposition of the habitual residence condition affected Travellers? I know it has affected Irish citizens from the Border region who have had to move between the two jurisdictions for work. Very often, they find the condition affects their entitlement to social welfare benefits and they are forced to make an appeal. What is Pavee Point's experience with the HRC?</p>

          <p eId="para_164">Deputy Ó Ríordáin had information that there were approximately 5,000 Roma in Ireland. How many Travellers are living in Ireland?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_76">
          <from> Ms Ronnie Fay<recordedTime time="2013-02-06T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_165">There are about 36,000 Travellers in Ireland. This is based on the evidence from the all-Ireland Traveller health study which was undertaken by University College Dublin for the Department of Health and published in 2010. The census gives a figure of 29,000 but the Central Statistics Office would recognise some of the weaknesses in its figures because some enumerators may have been afraid to go on sites and Traveller families living in double-upped accommodation who may not been counted. The 36,000 figure is probably the more accurate. We estimate the Roma population is 5,000. If Travellers are 0.5% of the entire population, what does that make the Roma? This has also to be seen in the context of the European Union population of Roma which is 15 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> We are saying that we need to invest in inclusion measures now rather than creating a separate sub-culture of poverty which will cost us more in the long run. The bull must be taken by the horns now and integration should be proactively supported. We mean that in the best possible sense. We do not mean assimilation but respecting the different cultures. We need to hold on to what is good in the culture and challenge what is negative. Like all cultures, there are good and bad dimensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> In common with the groups that Senator Moloney mentioned, the HRC is having a negative impact on many other people other than who it was intended to affect when it was initially introduced. It was designed to address welfare tourism which never materialised as the numbers are very small. If one thinks about austerity and how Ireland is perceived in the European Union, I do not believe we are going to be awash with people coming to Ireland. We need to be pragmatic and adopt a common-sense approach to this. Several years ago, the HRC was a major issue for Travellers but those numbers have reduced. Many Travellers are now staying in Britain or going there because they have no chance of development in Ireland. The HRC is set down across the European Union. How can Irish Travellers in Britain qualify for social welfare in Britain when they cannot in the Irish context? I believe there are broader issues at play.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> It needs to be recognised that we need to build confidence among the Roma community when it comes to collating data on it, the same way we had to with Travellers. The nationality data was used to exterminate Roma in concentration camps in the past. Accordingly, they have a particular fear around data collection on ethnicity and nationality. One has to work with the community on this and they have to understand the value of the data which will inform evidence-based policy, counter discrimination and develop new initiatives. We have to take positive action now because of the Roma experience of genocide.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">We have Roma children going to university in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">There are many Roma families operating shops and working in Ireland but nobody takes note of this. They are not visible and do not want to be visible. When I first tried to rent a house and told the landlord I was Roma, he asked me "Do you beg?", which I do not. If one is Roma, the first question one is asked is, "Do you beg?"</p>

          <p eId="para_171">This has been an informative meeting. As suggested by Deputy Ryan, we will send the recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection and ask for her response. On the matter raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I do not think the committee has the capacity to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come before it.

          <p eId="para_173">May I make a suggestion? The committee could ask the Department of Justice and Equality to present its strategy for the integration of Roma people into Ireland, although in reality it does not have one. The Department should be made aware of the weaknesses in the system and be held to account in this regard. Deputy Ó Ríordáin asked earlier about the Government approach to the Roma community. As I stated earlier, the mindset is if we ignore them, they will go away. In our view, they will not go away. The perception is that they are creating problems for Irish society in terms of begging and so on. We are concerned about the impact of this on the Roma community whose human rights, health, education and employment prospects are being denied them.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">Yes. We have also included recommendations on issues such as violence in the home. In one particular case, a woman moved back in with her violent partner because she was not habitually resident. We have suggested that in the interim if habitual residence is to be applied it should at least be gender sensitive and should not place women in direct danger. It is important to us that the wider issue is addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">It does not have to make a presentation - a response by way of letter would suffice. We can then, based on the response, decide if we want to engage in a formal meeting. It would be useful if, as suggested by Ms Fay, we had sight of the strategy which is supposed to cover the Roma and Traveller communities but makes no reference to the Roma community. The Minister for Justice and Equality has stated that these issues will be addressed during the EU Presidency. While he is not accountable to this committee on EU Presidency issues it would be useful for him, at a time when we are encouraging the Department to take steps to address this issue, to include it. The key issue is that nothing can be provided for in the strategy because the Department has no census figures in this area. It might be helpful to the committee to prompt it to do the job of work done by UCD in terms of the Travellers' health group and so on. It can then at least point to what it is doing and suggest to other European Union countries that they do something similar.</p>
