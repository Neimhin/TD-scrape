          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I welcome Mr. Brendan Burgess, former chairman of the Financial Regulator's consumer panel, who will discuss the work of the Financial Regulator.  I draw Mr. Burgess's attention to the fact that while members of the committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before it.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I propose that we hear a short presentation from Mr. Burgess followed by a question and answer session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Brendan Burgess</from>
          <p eId="para_11">I thank the joint committee for the invitation to appear before it.  I am in a unique position to comment on the performance of the Financial Regulator for a number of reasons.  I have been an active campaigner on financial consumer issues for many years.  I run the consumer website <i>www.askaboutmoney.com</i> which keeps me in tune with what is happening on the ground for Irish financial consumers.  I was the first chairman of the consultative consumer panel of the Financial Regulator, appointed by the Minister for Finance.  The consumer panel has statutory responsibility under the Act to comment on the performance of the Financial Regulator and to comment to the Minister for Finance on the budget of the Financial Regulator.  Provision is made in the Act for the chairmen of the consumer panel and the industry panel to appear before Oireachtas committees when requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, I stress I am speaking in a personal capacity and not representing the views of the consumer panel or any other group with which I am or have been associated.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Financial Regulator supervises the solvency and liquidity of Irish financial institutions very well.  Irish banks are conservative in their lending and none has been exposed directly to the subprime lending problems although all are suffering from the subsequent credit crunch.  The Financial Regulator seems to have been well ahead of the game on liquidity reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The credit union movement in Ireland is facing serious long-term problems and no one within the movement is taking the lead in resolving them.  The Registrar of Credit Unions, which is part of the Financial Regulator, has adopted a very strong, plain-speaking approach with it in the face of opposition from the credit unions and their very many supporters.  The Financial Regulator receives considerable abuse for placing restrictions on the lending and investment activities of credit unions, but the restrictions are seen to be justified by the recent revelations that credit unions have lost approximately €40 million from investing in products they did not understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The Financial Regulator has won international recognition for its appropriate regulatory regime for the funds industry.  It does not overregulate or underregulate; it gets it about right.  There was some criticism over delays in approving new funds but, after consultation with the industry, these problems were ironed out.  Ireland offers a very competitive and friendly trading environment for these companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In some areas, the Financial Regulator's consumer protection mandate has been well carried out.  The Financial Regulator has successfully ensured that most overcharging by financial institutions has been addressed, resulting in refunds for customers.  It produces good leaflets on consumer topics and its website is good.  It gets good publicity for its various cost surveys, which should encourage people to shop around for better insurance and investment deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">After lengthy consultation with consumers and the industry, the Financial Regulator produced a very good consumer protection code.  It achieved a very sensible balance between overprotecting consumers and overregulating financial institutions.  It produced an excellent booklet on equity release for elderly people and this had an immediate and dramatic effect on the number of people taking out these products.  However, its performance regarding the consumer protection function is patchy and some failures to take any action are difficult to fathom and remain unexplained.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The mindset and culture of prudence and secrecy that make the Financial Regulator do its prudential job so well comprise a major drawback when it comes to protecting consumers.  Its work for consumers is characterised by extraordinary bureaucracy, slowness, excessive caution, a legalistic approach and, in particular, unnecessary secrecy.  It is very slow to take enforcement action.  It describes its consumer mandate as "helping consumers make informed decisions in a fair marketplace".  This focuses its efforts on information and on the consumer.  It should incorporate "enforcement" into its mandate.  It seems to prefer dealing with the financial institutions quietly and behind the scenes rather than by imposing sanctions on them publicly.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Over the past 18 months, the Financial Regulator has issued seven sanctions, three of which were reprimands and one of which was a voluntary self-exclusion from carrying on business.  Only three financial services companies were actually fined.  One of these, Marsh Ireland Limited, was fined for not issuing receipts for insurance premiums, a somewhat technical breach.  Sanctions were issued for only two serious breaches; a small broker was fined for overcharging customers and FEXCO Stockbroking Limited was fined €80,000 for not having proper accounting procedures in place for clients' funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">According to its annual report for 2007, the prudential division conducted 449 on-site inspections and review meetings, while the Registrar of Credit Unions had 104 inspections and meetings.  No figures were given in the report for inspections by the consumer division but I suspect there were very few.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">On the question of selling investment products to the elderly,<b> </b>when the Financial Services Ombudsman sees a pattern of complaints, the legislation makes provision for the ombudsman to refer the issue to the Financial Regulator and to suggest that it investigates it.  The ombudsman, Joe Meade, is concerned that 10% of the complaints to his office have been about financial institutions’ dealings with elderly people.  In his annual report for 2006 the ombudsman said he was so concerned about this that he considered it constituted systematic misselling.  He asked the Financial Regulator to take action.  In his annual report for 2007 he made a pointed comment that he had referred the matter to the Financial Regulator the previous year but the problem persisted.  Reading between the lines, the Financial Regulator appeared to have taken little or no action as suggested by the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">RTE's "Prime Time" investigated the issue of misselling in a programme aired on 29 May.  It sent a mystery elderly shopper to 11 banks and insurance brokers and her experience supported exactly what the ombudsman had found.  However, Ms Mary O'Dea, consumer director, Office of the Financial Regulator, told the programme she had "no information to say that there is a widespread problem across the industry."  She had arrived at a different conclusion from the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">How had she arrived at this conclusion?  Were surprise inspections of the advisers made?  Did the Financial Regulator send around its own mystery shoppers?  No, it had not.  Instead, "it was based on asking the companies at a senior level to examine their files and to look at the details of what they had done on a control basis."  I was not particularly surprised that the programme had found widespread mis-selling.  Most surprising was that the Financial Regulator had rejected this finding because senior management in the institutions claimed they were not misselling.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The Financial Regulator was very successful in getting refunds of overcharging by large financial institutions.  It has issued clear general principles on reimbursements.  These principles include refunding all persons who have been overcharged and not taking advantage of the six-year Statute of Limitations.  In its recently published annual report for 2007 the Financial Regulator stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_25">This review [of charging errors] entailed a look-back exercise stretching over a number of decades in some instances ... Our policy approach is to publicise maximum information on charging issues that arise and how they have been dealt with, both in aggregate and in terms of individual institutions...</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Irish Nationwide, however, has refused to abide by these principles and the Financial Regulator has let it get away with this.  The Financial Services Ombudsman found Irish Nationwide was imposing unlawful penalties on customers who repaid their loans early to switch their loan to another lender.  As this was systematic, he ordered the practice be changed for the future and refunds for all those overcharged going back six years — the statutory limit of his powers.  The amounts in these cases were often very large — the first refund was €29,000.  However, Irish Nationwide refused to go back more than six years and the Financial Regulator did not force it to go back any further.  To make matters worse, the Financial Regulator will not say why.  As it has never named Irish Nationwide for overcharging, customers who have paid this illegal penalty may not have read about it in the newspapers and so can do nothing about it.  Why does it not name Irish Nationwide?  Why does it not force the company to refund all customers?  We simply do not know.  This is only one issue relating to the practices of Irish Nationwide, in respect of which the Financial Regulator has taken no action.  There are many other lending practices and corporate governance issues which should have been investigated but nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Where a member of the public complains about an advertisement, the Financial Regulator acknowledges the complaint.  It states it is prevented by its duty of secrecy from responding to the complainant.  For example, BCP Asset Management launched a quadruple growth bond in 2003.  This offers to quadruple the rate of growth on the stock market, yet it guarantees 90% of the investment back if stock markets fall.  I made numerous complaints about this bond when it was first launched, as I considered it to be completely misleading.  The five bonds that have matured so far have not even matched stock market growth, yet the Financial Regulator continues to allow BCP to advertise this as a quadruple growth bond.  I cannot think of an explanation for this and the Financial Regulator states it is prevented from discussing it by its duty of secrecy.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The Financial Regulator seems to ignore unsolicited suggestions.  The Central Bank had a reputation for arrogance which I think has been inherited by the Financial Regulator.  When it asks people their opinions through consultation papers, it will enter a genuine consultation process and take on some of the suggestions made.  However, if it receives unsolicited suggestions, they will be rejected or ignored.  In the same way, it rejected consumer complaints about Irish Nationwide and advertising.  It takes little action in response to unsolicited suggestions from the consumer panel.  Worst of all, it rejected the Financial Services Ombudsman's findings on misselling to elderly people.  It hides behind section 33AK of the Central Bank Act.  This prohibits the Financial Regulator from disclosing any confidential details relating to a financial institution, but there are two very important exceptions in the legislation.  Section 33AK stipulates the bank may disclose confidential information with the consent of the person to whom the information relates or if the bank is satisfied that the disclosure is necessary to protect consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Everyone accepts that the Financial Regulator must be totally secret when it comes to the prudential supervision of banks.  Publicly highlighting its concerns about a financial institution would be disastrous.  How can this relate to advertising?  By its very nature, there is nothing confidential about advertising.  A confidential advertisement is a contradiction in terms.  When a member of the public takes the trouble to make a complaint about an advertisement, the Financial Regulator should make public its finding on the complaint.  The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland makes its decisions public and they make interesting reading.  So why can the Financial Regulator not do so as well?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">What about overcharging?  When it finds that an institution has been systematically overcharging customers, the Financial Regulator should highlight this to allow consumers to check if they have been overcharged.  At present, consumers have to rely on banks to notify them if they have been overcharged.  According to the annual report of the Financial Regulator, 38 institutions have made refunds of €181 million to customers, but only four have actually been named.  I suspect this was because they had already been named in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">When financial institutions refuse to refund fees which have been overcharged claiming that they are statute barred, the Financial Regulator should say this publicly.  Where there is serious disquiet about the treatment of consumers, the Financial Regulator needs to go public on the issue.  There have been serious allegations made before this committee about the way ACC-Rabobank treats some its business customers.  For the record, Rabobank has a very good reputation for its treatment of personal consumers.  It is very frustrating for those making these complaints, however, to hear nothing from the Financial Regulator.  It is frustrating to be told that the Financial Services Ombudsman cannot help either.  Of course, the Financial Regulator cannot get involved in legal cases involving individual borrowers, but if there are allegations of systematic problems which, at face value, have some merit, the Financial Regulator should confirm that it has at least investigated the allegations and comment on its findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">The Financial Regulator is doing its job very well in some areas.  There is no need for this committee to suggest changes in legislation as the law gives the Financial Regulator all the powers it needs.  However, it could suggest the following: that the regulator listens to the suggestions of consumers, the consumer panel and the ombudsman; puts enforcement of good behaviour higher up the priority list; and uses the full scope of the legislation to name and shame companies and individuals found to be in breach of the code.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I thank Mr. Burgess for his presentation.  I shall be brief and to the point.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Arising from this document, which is fairly self-evident, from what he says, is there scope for looking at the role of the consumer panel to intervene with the Financial Regulator or to intervene publicly in forums other than this one to highlight some of the issues Mr. Burgess talks about?  It seems that there is a culture within banking, which has always been secretive, for commercial and other cultural reasons.  That type of culture seems to pervade the remit of the Financial Regulator.  Is there scope for increasing the powers of the consumer panel to bring the Financial Regulator to book on some of the issues Mr. Burgess has outlined?  The role of the consumer panel as it is constituted at present, while it has a remit on committees such as this, is perhaps very limited in its scope and may need to be expanded somewhat.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">In terms of Mr. Burgess's presentation <i>vis-à-vis </i>the credit union movement, notwithstanding the regulator’s intervention on the loss of €40 million, I have often thought that this sector was underperforming in terms of its potential.  Given the amount of money on deposit within the credit union movement — I do not know the exact sum — and its purchasing power, is there scope to expand its operations in terms of credit facilities and increased banking facilities?  The credit union as it is constituted is owned by its membership.  Is there a role for the consumer panel?  While that question may be a little off the point, Mr. Burgess referred to the credit union movement.  From a consumer perspective, is there increased scope for the credit union movement to perhaps increase or widen its remit from a credit or financial institution perspective?</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I welcome Mr. Burgess to the meeting.  In his submission, Mr. Burgess makes the point that there is no need for legislative change.  However, it seems that in some areas there may be a need to consider the strengthening of the legislative framework to deal with the particular issues to which he referred.  Will Mr. Burgess expand on this point?</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Mr. Burgess concluded by stating we should listen to the suggestions of consumers, the consumer panel and the ombudsman.  I would be surprised if the regulator did not listen to or take account of these suggestions.  The issue is whether the regulator acts on the basis of the advice inherent in any of the suggestions made.  Will Mr. Burgess expand on this point?</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Mr. Burgess also referred to using the full scope of the legislation to name and shame companies and individuals who are found to be in breach of the code.  Does he feel there is an inadequacy in the legislative provision to deal with these issues?  How does he suggest it should be addressed?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I thank Mr. Burgess for attending and for his contribution.  I note he was the first chair of the consultative consumer panel of the Financial Regulator.  For how long did he serve and was there a reason he moved on?</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Mr. Burgess comes down very hard on the consumer director of the Financial Regulator.  Based on what he said, there has been passing of the buck.  Given the way Mr. Burgess alleges that person has acted in pursuance of that office, one could almost say it amounts to self-regulation, which would not be satisfactory.  In view of this, we have a duty, for the sake of balance, equity and fair play, to bring that person before the committee to hear that side of the story.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I note what Mr. Burgess said about secrecy in regard to the regulation and the Central Bank Act.  Perhaps this is an issue for another joint committee to examine and perhaps the Chairman could consult our people in that regard.  Some follow-up may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Mr. Burgess concludes by making three suggestions with regard to the Financial Regulator.  Perhaps we could deal with them when we have the Financial Regulator before the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Deputy Sherlock asked about the role of the consumer panel and whether it should be strengthened.  It has only been in place for approximately four years, although the various roles of the consumer panel and the industry panel were discussed a fair bit as the consultation process went through the Oireachtas.  It is a consultative panel.  When I was chairman, I was very clear that we were there to advise and make suggestions but we were not the board of the Financial Regulator.  It is up to the board — the authority, as it is called — to tell the Financial Regulator what to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">In a personal capacity, I have a public profile on these issues and have been involved in several campaigns.  I am happy to speak out as I see fit, whether to criticise or defend financial institutions.  The consumer panel deals with the Financial Regulator according to the regulations.  Although its minutes and suggestions are made public via the website, it does not see itself as having a campaigning remit.  The National Consumer Agency and other campaigning bodies are there to advocate on behalf of consumers.  The consumer panel includes 20 members who are extremely hard-working and have great experience of consumer issues.  It could work well if the Financial Regulator paid more attention to it.  There is no need to change the powers afforded to it but the operation of those powers must be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Deputy Sherlock asked about expanding the role of the credit unions.  One of the several problems facing the credit union sector is the massive increase in competition from banks and other financial institutions.  Whereas the banks are facing a liquidity problem in that they have lent almost as much money as they are permitted to lend, the credit unions have only lent some 50% of the money they have on deposit.  The latter find it difficult to lend money because, contrary to public perceptions, their rates are expensive compared with those of other lenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Credit unions have had an important role in lending small amounts of money to people who could not borrow from banks.  These days, however, banks will lend money cheaply to almost anybody.  As a result, the credit unions have not kept up and are not competitive.  Changes were recently made to the legislation to allow credit unions which meet certain criteria to offer larger and longer term loans.  This change was introduced after much discussion with the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Department of Finance and the credit union movement.  There is a problem in that the same people have been running the credit unions for the last 30 or 40 years.  The credit unions have not yet come into the modern age and there is a worry that problems will arise if they are allowed a freer rein in how they can invest and lend.  The Registrar of Credit Unions is calling that one well.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Deputy Kirk asked about legislative changes.  No such change is required to implement the consumer protection measures I advocate such as a naming and shaming policy and a more proactive focus on enforcement.  Much more could be achieved by making full use of the powers available under current legislation.  One significant legislative change that might be useful would be to split the consumer role of the Financial Regulator from its prudential role.  As it stands, the prudential role which involves ensuring banks and insurance companies are solvent and liquid and so on is its key focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The legislative provision that the Financial Regulator must be secret in all its dealings with financial institutions was designed for dealing with prudential and supervisory issues.  However, it is difficult for the Financial Regulator to defend the interests of consumers if it hides behind a section of the Act which requires its dealing with financial institutions to be conducted in secret.  There seems to be a misinterpretation of this provision.  The Act clearly provides that where it is in the interests of consumers, the Financial Regulator can speak publicly on the issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_50">Is Mr. Burgess stating the problem arises from the dilemma of having to serve two masters?  Is his point that the twin roles of serving the interests of the consumer and ensuring there is due diligence and prudence in the running of financial institutions are not compatible?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Brendan Burgess</from>
          <p eId="para_51">The factors affecting prudential supervision such as secrecy are not appropriate to defending and advocating on behalf of consumers.  The Financial Regulator is very careful from a legislative point of view and if it is not obliged to do something by law, it is slow to do it.  It is important that, as the main consumer interest is that banks should remain solvent, prudential supervision and consumer protection are not completely separate.  Were one to decide to split those functions, this must be borne in mind.  As consumers would not be served by an Irish financial institution becoming insolvent, prudential supervision is both the priority and in their interests.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">I refer to the nature of financial institutions, their <i>modus operandi</i> and the critical importance of trust in their dealings with the public.  A range of indiscretions have come to light in recent years, some minor, others less so.  If the world is told of such indiscretions or how financial institutions treated a particular issue or group of clients or customers, is there a danger that undue publicity or focus on the issue might damage public trust and confidence in their interests?  If one considered the indiscretion in isolation, the penalty may be disproportionate in such circumstances.  Is this a consideration?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Brendan Burgess</from>
          <p eId="para_53">Yes, that is a valid consideration.  I am not in favour of indicating every indiscretion by every bank and institution.  However, when many people have been affected, it is in the public interest that those who may have been so affected should hear about it publically to enable them to follow it up.  For example, people who were customers of the bank at the time and who used to buy foreign exchange from it should be allowed to follow up the matter.  One should not simply rely on the banks to calculate what the refund of the overcharge should be.  I would like to be informed, had my bank been involved in overcharging five years ago in respect of a particular product for which I was a customer.  I would check it out for myself.  The only way to facilitate this is to state that during a particular period and in respect of a particular product, bank X was found to be overcharging and has made refunds.  However, consumers should be allowed to check the matter for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Deputy Kirk asked whether the regulator listened to suggestions.  While I made suggestions, I do not believe the regulator listened to them.  I probably tended to take that somewhat personally.  Perhaps it was the manner in which I put them, or the regulator did not like me for it.  However, I was really surprised when the ombudsman suggested the regulator should investigate mis-selling to elderly people and it did not do so.  I do not see evidence that the regulator states, "that is a good idea on which we will go ahead and we will look into that issue."  As I noted, when it issues a consultation paper, it calls in people, responds and teases out issues.  However, it appears it does not like investigating particular issues that are not part of its corporate plan for the year such as, for example, someone asserting there is a problem with mis-selling to elderly people.  It does not appear to react by diverting resources to investigate the issue.  In this case, it contacted the senior executives in the financial institutions and asked what their procedures were for avoiding misselling.  It considered itself satisfied with the reassurances it received from senior managers that there was no misselling.  I found that very strange.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Brendan Burgess</from>
          <p eId="para_56">Yes.  The 2006 annual report of the Financial Services Ombudsman referred to many cases of misselling to elderly people and expressed concerns to the effect that such might be systematic, in light of which the issue was referred to the Financial Regulator.  The ombudsman can do so where there is a perceived systematic problem.  The following year, he made the point that the problems were persisting.  He did not make the statement I had expected, namely, that the Financial Regulator had examined the matter and supported or rejected his findings.  There is a gap.  We now know that the consumer director contacted the financial institutions and was assured that there was no problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">It should be left to the regulator's discretion due to the reasons referred to by the Deputy.  We do not want the regulator to publicise every indiscretion because it would not be practical.

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_62">Mr. Burgess mentioned the paragraph on selling investment products to the elderly.  There seems to be a glaring deficiency.  According to the 2006 report, the ombudsman referred the issue of misselling to the elderly to the regulator who, following a relevant "Prime Time" programme in 2008, reported that there was no information to verify a widespread problem.  Besides the ombudsman's report, the "Prime Time" programme showed clear evidence.  Is it a question of resources?  Is the Financial Regulator so consumed by the prudential rules governing banking and financial institutions that the consumer element of its operations is not as prioritised as it should be?  I want Mr. Burgess's opinion, not to put words in his mouth.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The majority of people have faith in financial institutions, given that they have bank accounts, mortgages and so on.  Due to an inherent faith in the system, the bulk of transactions are carried out without question.  However, people do not visit their bank branches and ask difficult questions about banks' functions.  Speaking for myself, there is a certain degree of ignorance born of an inherent trust.  Were more consumers to begin questioning at ground level the nature of the transactions, charging mechanisms, etc., there would be a different culture that would not give rise to the points being addressed by Mr. Burgess or programmes such as "Prime Time".</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Mr. Brendan Burgess</from>
          <p eId="para_64">It must be focused on the consumer from an information point of view and on the institution from an enforcement point of view.  I hope that I have stressed the fact that the consumer division of the Financial Regulator has done an excellent job in informing consumers.  Some people will not be informed and are turned off by financial services.  They go to their banks, buy currency and conduct their dealings without question.  However, more questions are being asked now as a result of the Financial Regulator's work in recent years.  It might not be enough but it has improved a lot.  The Financial Regulator has been useful in that area but I would prefer to see fewer mistakes made and greater enforcement to ensure people do not have to question complicated issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Senator Coghlan asked why I had moved on.  I served for three years as chairman.  We had an excellent consumer panel, made many suggestions and put much energy into it.  I thought I could achieve a lot more for consumers in my personal capacity than as chairman of the consumer panel.  Many of the suggestions were not being acted upon and there had to be much correspondence and many meetings to get something simple to happen.  It was a poor use of my time and someone else might be able to take a different approach and harness the panel in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Senator Coghlan asked if it amounted to self-regulation.  Although there was evidence of mis-selling, the financial institutions were asked if there was and they said there was not.  Self-regulation is a very good way to describe it.</p>

It produces an annual report and makes a submission on the budget to the Minister for Finance.  I do not know if these have been brought before the committee but they give the view of the consumer panel.  The reports are much longer than this document but I would describe them as balanced.  I hope I am balanced.  The ratings were nine out of ten and seven out of ten.  Improvement is needed in that area.  The Financial Regulator knows my views and those of the consumer panel.</p>
