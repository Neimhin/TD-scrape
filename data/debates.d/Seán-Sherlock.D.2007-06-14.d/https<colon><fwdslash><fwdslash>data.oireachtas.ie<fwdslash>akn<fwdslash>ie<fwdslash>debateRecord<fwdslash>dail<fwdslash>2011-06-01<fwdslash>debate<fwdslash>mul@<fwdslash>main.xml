          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach is aware that the programme for Government contains clear promises on budget matters.  It declares, "We will open up the budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny in a way that restores confidence and stability".  It promises to publish all of the assumptions upon which budget proposals are based.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The first test of this commitment is the handling of the jobs initiative and for the last three weeks the Opposition, the media, the pensions industry and pensioners have been seeking basic information from the Government concerning the decision to impose a €1.8 billion levy.  What we have been looking for is not exceptional.  We are simply looking for the analysis carried out for the Government on the impact which the levy is likely to have.  Before the House implements the levy, we are entitled to know what the Government believes the impact will be on personal pensions, on the incomes of older people and on the pensions industry itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">In a written reply last night to a question from Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister for Finance made the remarkable admission that he had no communication whatsoever with the Pensions Board before making this decision.  The Pensions Act states, as the first function of the board, that it will both monitor and supervise pensions developments, and it explicitly envisages that the Minister for Finance should seek advice from the board.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated——</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_5">——that this was a political decision.  That is obvious but the Taoiseach has given a personal commitment to opening up the process to the full glare of public scrutiny.  Is the Taoiseach happy that the legal role of the Pensions Board has been ignored in this case?  Can he tell us whether an analysis was carried out on the impact of taking €1.8 billion from personal pensions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I am not sure what Deputy Martin is looking for.  He is persisting as if there is some sort of hidden volume of detailed analysis and information about the jobs initiative and its funding, which is coming through a levy on the pensions industry.  We made it clear long before the election that in discussions with the pensions industry, the case was made that instead of reducing tax relief, a levy on the fund to be collected by the industry was the way to go.  This levy is 0.6%, which is 60 cent in €100.  It is a solidarity contribution which was based on 100% relief for building up very sizeable pension pots in the first place.  It is limited in nature and time and it is designed to create an initiative to provide employment around the country.  I am sure the Deputy supports that.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Committee Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 is taking place next week and the Deputy can ask the Minister for Finance all the questions he likes.  However, he should not run away with the idea that there are volumes of secret material on this levy in the Department of Finance.</p>

Now he tells us that we can ask questions on Committee Stage but that we will receive nothing else.  He informed the House yesterday, during Question Time, that he was personally involved in discussion and co-ordination of all economic matters at Cabinet.  If he will not supply us with even basic information about his first major budget decision, then why should we believe him when he states that he will analyse everything and open it up to public scrutiny?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I know that the Deputy is not interested in the Punch and Judy stuff that he has been at for the last few weeks.  I do not know whether he is opposed or in favour of a solidarity contribution, in the form of a pension levy, to create jobs.  Our duty and our responsibility is to grow this economy, to create jobs and to bring about a situation where people are going to have the opportunity to go to work.  That duty comes before any sectoral interest and I am sure the Deputy supports the opportunity for job creation arising from the solidarity contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">So the Deputy has no regard for the people in Cork South-Central who will gain employment from the jobs initiative.  I remind the Deputy that people earning as little as €80 per week pay the universal social charge that the Deputy's Government introduced as a result of the mess it made in the first place.  If the Deputy thinks it is unfair that an industry pays 60 cent out of every €100 towards job creation for a four year period, then I must point out that every single sector of this society has a contribution to make and will make that contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">This morning, hundreds of thousands of people are coming to terms with the prospect of two new stealth taxes announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, yesterday.  Tuigeann muid go bhfuil Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag gearradh cánacha dúbailte ar an lucht oibre.  Is mór an náire dóibh é sin.  Despite all the pre-election promises from its Labour Party colleagues, we now know that new water charges will be introduced, along with a new household charge.  Can the Taoiseach tell the hundreds of thousands of hard-pressed families listening to him today exactly how much these two new taxes will cost them?  The Minister said the purpose of the water tax was to reduce water usage, yet 40% of our water is lost because of the bad mains system.  I understand the cost of the new meters will be €500 million.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the best way to conserve water would be to use that €500 million to improve our water system, creating jobs in the process, and reduce the massive waste of water, without imposing two additional taxes on hard-pressed working families?</p>

          <p eId="para_51">No, I cannot give the Deputy the answer to his question of how much the tax will cost families.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has signalled clearly the Government's intention to implement its programme for Government and also to comply with the conditions of the EU-IMF bailout deal, which, in its revised wording, states that the Government will prepare proposals for implementation of the recommendations of the independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water service provision from local authorities to a water utility, in consultation with the European Commission services, with a view to starting charges during the EU-IMF programme period.  It is also stated in the programme for Government that there should be a charge for water after a generous free allowance.  The Minister signalled the Government's intention for this to be implemented.  The Government has not made a decision about the nature or the scale of the system.  It is clearly a signal by the Minister of the Government's intention to implement the provisions of the programme for Government and comply with the conditions of the EU-IMF bailout deal, which states that such a system should be implemented during the course of the bailout programme, which operates up to 2013.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">There is a pattern to the Taoiseach's replies to questions that I put.  He is always clear about what measures will cost the big people in our society, but totally unclear about what they will cost ordinary people.  There are people watching this who want to know, as they wake up this morning, how much the charges will cost them.  I will give some figures in this regard.  The Central Bank said in February that €6 billion of senior bond debt was held by Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  A modest 50% reduction would save the State €3 billion.  Would it not be better for the Government to face up to these bad banking debts than to follow the diktat of the EU and IMF and Fine Gael's own instinct on matters to do with privatisation?  Would it not be better to hold senior bondholders to account?  Even some of the banks have held certain junior bondholders to account.  Is that not a more decent, fairer and proper way to proceed?  Will the Taoiseach not consider doing that?</p>

It is a signal that we intend to implement the programme for Government and comply with the conditions of the EU-IMF bailout deal.  There will be no charge this year.  I have already signalled as a general principle that water charges would apply only after a generous free allowance had been used.  Of course the Government, in making its decision, will take into account those who are in distressed economic circumstances, whether because they are on social welfare or low incomes, or because of their mortgages.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">Last night, the Government supported moves by Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Life &amp; Permanent to burn the junior bondholders in those three financial institutions.  Everybody in this House will welcome that decision.  It was a fine decision and it seems to be a break with previous decisions by all Governments that in order to sort out the banking crisis, the small people, pensioners, shareholders and taxpayers should pay.  I wonder if the Government would consider applying part of the solution to this problem, that is, a debt-equity swap, which incidentally was first suggested from these benches, also to senior bondholders.  What should be realised by the Government, if it has courage, is that there are untouchable elements in the banks and financial institutions which have not yet been affected.  There is a mass of fat still sitting in the financial institutions which can be tackled.  I am thinking particularly of the senior bondholders, who, incidentally, were expecting to be burnt and are standing in wonder at the generosity of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I am thinking also of the pensions industry, about which I asked a question the other day.  The pensions industry is loaded with fat.  About two weeks ago the Taoiseach, very helpfully, said he would refer that matter to the Minister for Finance.  It is the industry that should pay, not the pensioners putting money into pension funds.  Will the Taoiseach tell me what the result has been of his referring the matter to the Minister for Finance?  The Finance (No. 2) Bill still contains measures to raise money from the pensioners through the 0.6% levy.  Is there now hope that we will get the money from the fat of the industry rather than those paying in who can ill afford it?</p>

I can tell him the Minister for Finance is in direct discussions with the pensions industry about the proposition he made.  Whatever comes of those discussions will be reported to the House and to him.  The suggestion was helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">In respect of the matter of a debt for equity swap, we need to be careful about the responses we give on something like this.  A more appropriate forum might be to have a detailed discussion at the finance committee on the background, the current situation and what the consequences of a number of propositions such as this might be.</p>

This uncertain situation is also undermining investors who have spent large amounts in preparation and planning and who are dependent on bank support to deliver these services.  The consequences of this uncertainty are also putting potential jobs in jeopardy as approved nursing homes cannot proceed unless they receive bank loans and the applicants have been told that loans will not be approved without the issue being sorted out.

The motion which the Government wants to push through the House is far more serious than the Taoiseach stated yesterday.  It would directly force the tribunal to end in six months time irrespective of the state of its investigations.  The media has been briefed with negative comments about the tribunal but not one piece of briefing material has been supplied to Members of the House to justify this motion.  Far more seriously, there has been no consultation with interested parties.  Confidence-damaging conspiracies are already being put on this, including the idea that the move is equal to the British refusal to release files on the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  There is no need to rush this measure through the House without consultation or the circulation of any materials behind the decision.

          <p eId="para_101">I invite the Deputy to send Deputy Ferris, Deputy Doherty, Deputy Ó Snodaigh or Deputy Ó Caoláin to the Whips' meeting to raise this matter of whatever they want discussed and time will be granted to them.  There are many requests for speaking time on different reports and debates and that one will be considered in the same way as any other.  We have no difficulty at all and Deputy Broughan and I agree that we should talk about these matters and reports.  That will be granted to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">The debate on legislation to establish the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform begins today, but the detail of that legislation raises major questions about the future business of the House.  According to the Bill, the first stage of the new Estimates process will involve the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, proposing a net Estimates figure to the House which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will then allocate to Departments.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when it is proposed to hold the new Estimates vote and when Departments' Estimates are to be published, as well as the date on which the budget is scheduled to be announced?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">A comprehensive spending review is ongoing and will be finished by September, after which date the Government will have a clear picture of how best to proceed, given the realities of its findings.  Ministers will sit down with the Minister for Finance in respect of the proposals made in the preparation of the budget for 2012.  We have not yet fixed a date for the announcement of the budget, but when we get through the comprehensive spending analysis, we will be in a much clearer position to give dates for the publication of Estimates and announcement of the budget.  We will give them as soon as we get a fix on the matter.</p>

I have undertaken to the House to provide an accurate revision of where we are with all of those Bills.

            <p eId="para_273">The European Council on 11 March 2011 was called to discuss the unfolding developments in Libya and the southern Mediterranean area.  I received the normal briefings prepared by officials for a Taoiseach in advance of a meeting of this kind.  At the meeting, there was general discussion around the table, in which I participated, and which, in the normal manner, resulted in some adjustments to the draft conclusions as they were being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_274">There was also a meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone on 11 March.  I participated in that meeting in a similar fashion.  I reported to the House on both meetings on 22 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_275">I regularly meet with my EU colleagues, including the Prime Minister of Greece.  Our most recent meeting was at the European Council in Brussels at the end of March.  Working to defend and advance Ireland's interests is my absolute priority.  Building alliances of support is important in that regard.  Contacts at all levels, official and political, are frequent and ongoing.  While the agenda for the June European Council is not yet finalised, it is expected to discuss economic policy issues, migration and matters relating to Croatia's accession to the Union.  It is also expected to endorse a Presidency report on the inclusion of the Roma population in the EU, and to endorse the Council's Conclusions on the launch of the Danube strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_276">In the context of recent events in the southern Mediterranean area, I anticipate that the discussion on migration will include consideration of the current arrangements under the Schengen Agreement for countries that participate and the completion of the common European asylum system.  Economic policy issues will include the making of country specific recommendations on foot of proposals made by the Commission.  These represent another step in the European semester process and are intended to inform the national budgets that member states will adopt later in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_277">The appointment of the President of the European Central Bank is also expected to arise.  In this regard the ECB and European Parliament are currently being consulted on the appointment of Mr. Mario Draghi to the post.</p>

The Taoiseach has frequently said that the reduction of the interest rate, which Sinn Féin welcomes, is a priority but he has consistently failed to raise it at meetings where it would be appropriate.  Does the Taoiseach expect this reduction to be secured at the next meeting?  How much will the reduction save the Irish taxpayer?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the release of the live register figures, with unemployment now at 14.8%, an increase of 3,000 citizens unemployed since last May?  Is that not a priority issue as well?

            <p eId="para_279">I set out my priorities and I have made the point that working to defend and advance Ireland's interests is my absolute priority.  That means building alliances of support politically.  I do not set the agenda for the European Council meeting, although I will contribute to it and I have outlined the general principles surrounding the agenda, which is not yet finally determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_280">The question of the conclusion of an interest rate reduction — another European Commissioner has indicated support for it today — is being pursued by the Ministers responsible for finance.  The Deputy is also aware that the Heads of Government, myself among them, devolved that authority to the Ministers because at the time of the leaders' meeting, there was no conclusion to the stress tests on the Irish banks.  In its absence — there is a requirement for accurate figures if seeking support — the matter was left to the Ministers responsible for finance.  The Deputy is aware that the matter is still being negotiated.  I am also sure the Deputy has heard the reports from other European figures regarding the fairness that should be extended in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">It is realistic to say that this country entered into an IMF-EU bailout deal and the conditions of that have been revised, renegotiated and accepted by the troika, and these are the conditions being met by Ireland.  It is unfair to expect that this country should be asked to deal with matters that other countries are not expected to deal with.  We have a very clear view on that.  I do not expect this to be a matter for discussion at the Heads of Government meeting but if it comes up, I will deal with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_284">I have noted the unemployment figures from the live register, which are too high.  Every job lost is a tragedy for somebody and every job gained is a source of enjoyment and happiness.  Considering the difference between the live register figures and the real figure of those unemployed, it is very high in this country.  The results of the jobs initiative have not kicked in yet but I hope the impact of that focused attention will bring some relief to those figures.  Everybody in the Chamber and outside is concerned about the live register figure and hopes to decrease it.  We must do that by growing our economy and confidence, investing in opportunities for employment, removing red tape and bureaucracy and opening the doors for business to flourish.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">That is where our focus remains and why we made decisions relating to the banks and the jobs initiative and why we are looking at the way money was spent and the value obtained for it.  We hope to prioritise from September onwards what it is we must do in these circumstances to have fairness in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_286">A question about the March Council meeting has nothing to do with the June meeting, and those should not be grouped with questions about future meetings.  The Taoiseach has taken to ignoring questions when more than one is asked so I want to concentrate on No. 2, which relates to the Council meeting of 11 March.  The communiqué from 11 March is very important because it sets out the as yet unfulfilled commitment to have more sustainable terms for loans to Ireland and others.  Did the Taoiseach table any amendments to that communiqué or did he accept the version available to him when he took office?</p>
            <p eId="para_287">For over two and half months there have been constant leaks about this agreement being implemented and yesterday in the House the Taoiseach stated that "we have negotiated down the cost of the deal".  We should have elaboration on that because I am not clear on whether the deal has been negotiated in terms of cost at all.  A shared urgency was evident on 11 March but to where has that disappeared?</p>
            <p eId="para_288">Question No. 4 relates to the next European Council meeting.  Does the Taoiseach agree there is now a grave risk that the growing sense of drift and a lack of leadership will bring a new crisis upon us very soon?  That is the atmosphere in which comments from an Irish Minister can get carried in reports throughout the world and can have a damaging impact on markets and their perception of Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that our basic position for this Council will be that the delay must stop and the promise of more sustainable support, given at the 11 March Council meeting, can be delivered?  Otherwise the issue may get out of control.</p>
            <p eId="para_289">I am surprised at the Taoiseach's revelation today that he does not intend to raise these issues at the Council meeting.  We have a role in setting the agenda and every member state can contribute to the setting of an agenda for a Council meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_293">The import of the communiqué which emerged from the meeting of 11 March means we should expect at the next Council meeting at least a progress report on delivering the conclusions reached.  The contents of that communiqué relating to having a more sustainable programme of supports for countries like Ireland and others were negotiated by the outgoing Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_294">I fully understand that any country can contribute to the setting of an agenda for a meeting but my point is that I do not set the full agenda and it is not yet set.  The extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 11 March was convened by President Van Rompuy to discuss developments in Libya and the southern Mediterranean region.  It was to set the political direction and priorities for future EU action and policy.  We agreed on the importance of Europe developing a new and enhanced long-term partnership with the countries of the southern Mediterranean region as they move towards democracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">The decision was taken at the meeting before that in respect of the pursuit of an interest rate reduction.  That is now in the capable hands of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.  If this matter arises at the June meeting, I will certainly deal with it.  When Greece was given its interest rate reduction and the Greek Prime Minister sought an extension of a repayment period, which was approved, they were outside the EFSF category bloc.  The agreement was that countries in that would be entitled to a reduction.  Some of our European colleagues felt that Ireland, in particular, should comply with extra conditions to avail of an interest rate reduction but we are still negotiating the matter.  Quite a number of European commentators have now been very forthright in their view about that.  If the opportunity arises I will raise the matter at the June meeting and if it comes up I will be very happy to deal with it.  As the Deputy knows, the decision was taken that the Ministers responsible for finance would conclude the matter of interest rate reduction negotiations at their level.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_296">My question related to whether the Taoiseach had detailed discussions with the Greek Prime Minister or senior members of the Greek Government.  This is in preference to just happening upon them at European meetings.  I asked this because I have spoken to public representatives in Greece recently and the Taoiseach would find it illuminating to do so.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has already done this.  In order to secure a 1% reduction in the interest rate, Greece has had to agree to sell its ports and harbours, power generation and the water and telecommunications systems.  It has also had to close down and merge hospitals, agree to cancel the minimum wage and sell the Popular Bank, which is the Greek equivalent of a credit union.  Interestingly, there is a review of that required in the EU and IMF deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_297">The country is faced with a position where it is unable to meet the terms of that deal.  I was informed by the same public representative that the Greek authorities are now being asked to put up other State assets, including land banks, as collateral against future loans.  This looks like the asset stripping of a country and it is required in return for reductions in its loan rate as part of the overall package.  It certainly does not look like a bailout.</p>

            <p eId="para_299">It looks like the destruction of a society.  Did the Greek Prime Minister or any of the other senior Government officials with whom the Taoiseach spoke inform him this was the price of signing up to EU-IMF deals?  This is the future we will face if we continue with this deal instead of doing what the people in the streets of Greece and some of us in this House advocate, namely, walking away from the bankers' debt and telling them to pay for their own losses.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_133">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_300">I am surprised at the Deputy.  He knows that he is speaking about the difference between chalk and cheese because these are two very different situations.  I sympathise with the Greek people in their difficulties.  I spoke with the Greek Prime Minister in a face-to-face meeting at which he explained the difficulties that his country was beginning to experience and asked for support in respect of his request for an interest rate reduction.  The national debt had doubled in a very short period, the banks were looking for €100 billion and his people were beginning to react strongly.  However, the Greek situation is very different from that which applies in Ireland's case.  We have already met the quarterly review analysis and have received approval in respect of meeting our conditions and commitments.  The Deputy should focus on where we stand as a consequence of entering the IMF-EU bailout deal.  We want to return to a position where Ireland has full control over its economic sovereignty in the shortest possible time.  The details of the conditions of our participation in the IMF-EU deal are set out and published and are now being complied with.  It does not involve the scale of issues to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_301">We have to continue building on the trade surplus we enjoy because of our strong exports.  Interest in investing in Ireland remains exceptionally strong and American industry, for example, has considerable liquidity available to it for continued investment.  That is the reason our 12.5% tax rate continues to be a matter of fundamental importance and why it is necessary for us to rebuild our international reputation for the flexibility of our workforce and our proven entry record to the European Union.  We also need to develop our own indigenous industries and pursue the opportunities that exist for employment creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_302">These are very different situations.  Ireland cannot be compared to any other country facing a bailout and it should not be compared to other countries in that regard.  Each of the governments concerned is grappling with its own particular problems and the Irish Government has made decisions that will point our country in the direction of being able to comply with the conditions of the IMF-EU bailout and allow us to remove ourselves from the deal in the shortest possible time, an objective to which I am sure the Deputy also aspires.</p>

            <p eId="para_303">Arising from the Taoiseach's reply to the two questions I tabled, I am taken aback by his comment, "if it comes up".  This is a European Council meeting.  When he attended his first meeting on 11 March there was great fanfare about what he was going to do and how he was going to bang tables.  That seems to have disappeared from all the spinning and media briefing.</p>

Why will the Taoiseach not raise at the European Council the more fundamental issues agreed in the communique of 11 March on delivering more sustainable loan terms not only for Ireland but also as a comprehensive European solution to the debt issue?  A pattern is emerging whereby everything is being divested to Ministers once it does not land on the Taoiseach's desk.</p>

I have every faith in the capacity of the Minister for Finance to deal with the responsibility allocated to him and his colleagues by the Heads of Government.  The Minister pointed out in a contribution which received credible support that the level of interest in European programmes should be lower and that the cost is too high.  He received strong support from a number of countries after he made that contribution.  The Heads of Government have given this responsibility to the Ministers for Finance and our Minister is exceptionally strong in this area and has pointed out clearly that the cost of European programmes is too high.  At the last meeting, the agenda of which was dominated by the Greek situation, he made that point in general and I am sure the Deputy agrees with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_309">I have confidence in the Minister and support him as he carries out the duties and responsibilities assigned to him.  Otherwise we will deal with this at Heads of Government level.  I will presently receive a briefing from officials in respect of issues we think should be discussed and I will contribute to the meeting according to whatever actually appears on the agenda.  This particular matter was given to the Ministers for Finance by the Heads of Government and I have every faith in the ability of our Minister to carry out his duties.  In that sense, he has been exceptionally strong, clear and forthright on where Ireland stands and where we want to be.</p>

Many people were struck by the speed and consistency of the briefing against one of the Taoiseach's advisers and this even went so far as to show what exactly one of his advisers said to him when they were discussing his College Green speech.  Every fair-minded person can see that she was treated badly by whomever of her colleagues chose to brief about her responsibilities.

The problem is that so far he has been willing to talk about accountability in a general sense but to deflect questions that relate to specific accountability on issues.  He said yesterday he had a major role in economic issues outside of his Cabinet role but then said again that any specific questions about individual issues should be put to Ministers and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_335">With regard to his non-established staff, has he given sectoral responsibilities to advisers as an important statement of his priorities across the board?  For example, will his advisers give advice to Cabinet sub-committees in specific areas?  Are they members of Cabinet subgroups relating to social inclusion, for example?</p>

He has been our economist for a number of years and he is obviously associated and acquainted with all the elements of the programme for Government and advises me on a regular basis about issues related to that and so on.

            <p eId="para_350">I thank the Taoiseach.  The last time I raised this issue he said no external applications would be invited and there would be no independent involvement in filling these posts, even though this directly contradicts stated Fine Gael policy.  His only justification then was that this is the way it has always been.  Both jobs are being filled at the same time.  The process is important as it will determine the leadership of his Department and the Cabinet secretariat for at least the next seven years.  Who has taken the role of assessing the potential appointees?  What measures has the Taoiseach put in place to make sure everyone involved in helping him to assess the candidates reveals to him any connections they may have to the applicants?  Has he put in place guidelines for the selection process?</p>

            <p eId="para_351">I have not.  The new post is being established to support the operation of two new mechanisms at the centre of government to enhance co-operation, effectiveness and co-ordination in the critical areas of economic management and EU co-ordination.  That is the purpose of the Second Secretary General post.  This post will include responsibility for the Government economic management council, about which the appointee will report to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he or she will co-ordinate support for him in his engagement with Government issues, including Cabinet committee structures.  The Second Secretary General will also have responsibility for EU co-ordination in which he or she will report, as appropriate, to me and the Tánaiste.  He or she will be a member of the management advisory committee of the Department of the Taoiseach, reporting to the Secretary General of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_352">Expressions of interest have been received in respect of this post and no decision has been taken beyond that yet.

That process moved quickly, partly because the Deputy was asking why the Minister was not in the House to answer questions about the new Department.  There is a board in place to deal with the expressions of interest and interviews for applicants for the post in the Department of children and youth affairs.  That has been set up and people are being consulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_356">As I understand it, an interview board has not been set up but that will happen shortly.  It will be followed by a process to fill the position of Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The criteria that will be set out will include experience, competence and a capacity to manage and deal with personnel, other Departments and a broad range of issues.  We will publish those criteria when they are available.</p>

            <p eId="para_365">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_366">The visit to this country by the US President, Barack Obama, and the First Lady, Michelle Obama, was a very tangible expression of the warmth and strength of the relationship between our two countries.  It was also a great opportunity to show a positive image of Ireland to the world, building on the images from the historic visit by Queen Elizabeth the previous week.</p>
            <p eId="para_367">During the course of my bilateral meeting with the US President, we had a broad discussion covering a range of issues.  We discussed the global economic situation and I briefed him on our strategy for overcoming our economic difficulties and the range of important decisions and initiatives taken by the Government since we took office.  I informed him of the priority that we are giving to job creation through the jobs initiative, as well as the actions we have taken on the banking system and the initiation of a comprehensive review of expenditure as a central plank in the strategy to reduce the budget deficit.</p>
            <p eId="para_368">We discussed the progress made so far in our discussions at EU level and with the IMF-EU-ECB troika.  I shared my analysis of that with President Obama, as I did with the UK Prime Minister Cameron when I met him.  While acknowledging that these were primarily matters for discussion in an EU context, I used the opportunity to ensure that the US Administration was clear on our objectives in trying to improve on the current programme and our determination to take the necessary action at home to deal with our problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_369">We reflected in our discussions on the common aspects of the economic challenges we face, notwithstanding the huge difference in size between our two economies.  We discussed trade and investment between our countries, including the importance of foreign direct investment by American investors in Ireland and the fact that 80,000 Americans across 50 states work in Irish-owned companies.  I assured the President that US investment is most valuable to Ireland's economic recovery and emphasised that Ireland is also creating employment in the US.  I repeated that we will retain our 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  The President updated me on progress with the reform of the US corporation tax system and we agreed that our officials would stay in touch on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_370">We discussed developments with regard to Northern Ireland, including the Assembly elections, the very strong community reaction to the murder of Constable Ronan Kerr and the Government's intention to further develop all-island co-operation, including in discussions at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting on 10 June.  I expressed my appreciation to the President for the long-standing and continued engagement by the US in the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_371">I raised the prospects for immigration reform in the United States, following the President's recent speech on the matter.  He updated me on progress to date, on what remains a very difficult domestic political issue in the US.  We also discussed a range of international issues, including developments in the Middle East and Afghanistan and our joint initiative on food security and the fight against hunger.</p>
            <p eId="para_372">We did not have any specific discussions about the Government's new initiative to engage the Irish diaspora in efforts to create jobs in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_375">I know.  Sin é.  The visit was welcome and successful.  I was delighted with it.  I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge the work undertaken by his predecessor, Brian Cowen, in conjunction with ambassadors Rooney and Collins in working to get President Obama to agree to visit our country.</p>
            <p eId="para_376">On the economic issues to which the Taoiseach alluded in his reply, which I raised in my questions, in the aftermath he indicated that the meetings with the President were detailed and substantive.  Given the prominence of claims concerning the attitude of the Administration in the United States towards bank bondholder debt, could the Taoiseach indicate that he raised that specific issue with the President?  Could he tell us what was said in that regard and what the President's reply was in terms of their approach to bondholder debt?  Equally, given the clear threat to this country of new rules on taxing overseas income, in particular of US multinational companies abroad, could the Taoiseach indicate the outcome of that discussion and whether the issue was specifically raised?</p>
            <p eId="para_377">Last week the Taoiseach indicated that he did not raise the interest rate with Prime Minister Cameron.  Did he specifically raise the issue of better, sustainable loan terms and a reduction in the interest rate with President Obama?  That is an important issue to us.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_180">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_378">The President's message to this country was, "We want you to succeed".  As I outlined, we covered a range of issues to which Deputy Martin referred.  I briefed him on the decisions taken by the Government in respect of the banks, the jobs initiative and the work that will continue following the comprehensive spending review as we prepare for the budget.  I also explained to him about our relations with our European colleagues and about the devolution of authority to the Finance Ministers in respect of an interest rate reduction in this country's bailout deal.  I expressed to him the enthusiasm and great support I detected in the United States, both in Washington and in New York, among Irish-American business and other potential investors in this country and I elaborated on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_379">The President said that the United States is quite a distance from the evolution of a tax package.  That arose in respect of the corporate tax rate which we retain.  Tax laws in the United States are both complex and voluminous.  The President indicated that they were at the start of a very long process in the US but that there should be continuous contact between officials in this country and his Administration about developments.  I gratefully accepted his offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_380">The President also said in respect of immigration, which I know is of interest to Deputy Martin, that while the perception was that this might be a Hispanic problem only, there are other nationalities who had an interest in the matter being sorted out as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_381">We covered all of the issues, from the comprehensive spending review to our intention of getting the deficit below 3% by 2015, rebuilding trust with our European colleagues, ambassadors, politicians and others.  The discussion lasted approximately 45 minutes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_181">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_382">The bank bondholder debt is a fundamental issue.  Did the Taoiseach specifically raise that with the President, particularly given the commentary around the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, and his alleged intervention at the G8, in terms of clarifying — if that is the case — that there was to be no burning of bondholders or no substantive restructuring?  This is important in terms of any potential pan-European restructuring of debt that could be agreed eventually at that level, which is something that must happen.  We need a pan-European approach to be taken more quickly than is happening.  I am surprised the Taoiseach did not ask President Obama what the US perspective on the issue of bondholder debt was.  Does it have a position on it?  The US would have influence in terms of the IMF, which is a key partner with the institutions in terms of the deal with Ireland.  Did the Taoiseach raise the issue with the President?</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_383">As the Taoiseach is aware, I took the opportunity, in his presence, to raise with President Obama the plight of the undocumented Irish and the search for peace in the Middle East.  All of the Palestinian groups in the Middle East, including Hamas and Fatah, have come together and signed a reconciliation pact.  Does the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, welcome that?  The Taoiseach will also be aware that George Mitchell stood down from his post there.  Will he join with me in thanking him for his efforts?  We all know the work he did for our peace process.  He put in significant work in the Middle East and I met him there several times.  We should thank him and wish him, his wife and his children well for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_384">I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that €20 billion relief for the Irish taxpayer, in terms of senior unguaranteed bank debt, would be a huge relief for our people and would provide money for a real job stimulus.  Did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about the allegation around that matter?  If not, will he ask the US Government whether the allegation is true?  It is a serious allegation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_184">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_385">I commend George Mitchell for the work he did in this country.  He was an outstanding person and was appointed by former President Clinton to come here.  He spent six months in Northern Ireland and had little opportunity to play his part at the beginning, but his influence, personality and patience won through in the end.  He is a person of the highest standards for whom I have absolute regard.  I wish him, his wife and his young family success and good health in the years ahead.  He made a remarkable contribution to the peace process here and we all owe him a debt of gratitude in respect of his behaviour, which as a negotiator in very difficult circumstances was outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_386">I briefed President Obama on our decisions in respect of the banking structure, the governance of the banks and our relations with the troika.  In that context, I would have indicated to him our decision in respect of subordinated bondholders and how that had evolved in Europe from a point when that was not going to happen now where it is an accepted part of dealing with the particular problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance may well have to go to court shortly in pursuance of this matter and I referred to that in my conversation with the President.  The assertion in the Kelly argument with regard to Mr. Geithner was an assertion arising from a meeting that took place in Asia last November.  The matter was not on the agenda for the G7, but I understand it came up in some side conversations and I have no evidence of what was actually discussed.  When I met Mr. Geithner in Washington, we talked about the Irish situation, in which he was very interested, and he attended the meeting the following day in the Oval Office with the President.  He retains a strong interest in seeing that Ireland meets its challenges and gets out of these difficulties.  His President committed himself to supporting Ireland in whatever way he can and I am very grateful for that.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_389">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_390">That Dáil Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad Éireann on 24 March 2005, pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004, be amended as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_391">"1. in paragraph (I)—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_392">(<i>a</i>) by substituting ‘not later than 30 June, 2011’ for ‘as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the Tribunal’, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_393">(<i>b</i>) by deleting subparagraph (c);</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_394">2. in paragraph (II) by substituting ‘public interest;' for ‘public interest; and';</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_395">3. in paragraph (III) by substituting ‘referred to it; and' for ‘referred to it.'; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_396">4. by inserting the following paragraph after paragraph (III):</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_397">‘(IV) in any event, the Tribunal shall complete its inquiries and submit its final report to the Clerk of the Dáil not later than 30 November, 2011.'."</p>
          <p eId="para_398">This motion seeks to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of the Garda Síochána or other employees of the State in the brutal murders by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  While the original Dáil motion was passed on 23 March 2005 and the motion in the Seanad on 24 March 2005, the tribunal was ultimately established on 31 May 2005 and it is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I wish to state emphatically at the outset that the purpose of this proposal is not to impede, confine or in any way interfere with the independence of the tribunal in fulfilling the terms of reference in respect of the inquiry being undertaken.  It is not about the winding down of a tribunal.  Instead, it is about fulfilling this House's responsibilities, while fully supporting the work of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The purpose of the motion is to afford the Dáil the opportunity to consider the current state of play with the tribunal's work and it seeks to establish a timeframe which is reasonable for the tribunal to complete that work.  I do not believe it would have been appropriate, given the respective roles of the Oireachtas and the tribunal, for me to have consulted with Mr. Justice Smithwick about the terms of the motion before the House today.  However, I can tell the House that some time ago Mr. Justice Smithwick indicated to me that the tribunal would be able to conclude its work within the timescale now contemplated by the motion.  I believe it to be both in the public interest and in the interest of those bereaved by the callous murders of the two police officers to underpin that in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Notwithstanding that, I wish to put it firmly on the record of the House that if, for any reason, this does not prove possible, the chairman can report back to the Clerk of the Dáil to the effect that circumstances have arisen which require that timescale to be extended.  I offer this House the solemn assurance that the Government's response to that will be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  I believe that this assurance can meet fully concerns which have been expressed about the public imposition of a deadline.  While, as I have already indicated, I have not consulted with Mr. Justice Smithwick about the specific terms of motions, I will convey that assurance to him in light of concerns he has expressed to me about any possible effects of an indication by this House of a deadline.  Six years after its establishment and the expenditure of over €8 million of taxpayers' money by my Department, I believe that this approach best protects the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The motion also requires the chairman to prepare and submit an interim report by the end of June.  Again, this is consistent with the tribunal's own timescale, which envisages public hearings commencing on 7 June with an opening statement by counsel on that date.  There has been some misinformed public comment about this, apparently based on the mistaken view that this is a new requirement.  In fact, under the current terms of reference the chairman must submit an interim report on certain matters as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal.  The motion, therefore, does not impose any substantive additional requirement or undesirable burden or onus on the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">This tribunal arose from the Weston Park talks in 2001, when the Irish and British Governments appointed an eminent retired Canadian Supreme Court judge, Peter Cory, to undertake a thorough investigation of six particular allegations of collusion to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a public inquiry.  In the case of the two RUC officers, Judge Cory considered allegations that a member of the Garda Síochána, or a civilian employed in the Garda organisation, advised either those directly responsible for the killings or members of their organisation of the visit of the two RUC officers to Dundalk Garda Station and, in particular, advised them of their departure from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">On the afternoon of 20 March 1989, Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan were ambushed just north of the Border as they returned from a meeting with senior Garda officers in Dundalk Garda station.  An IRA gang stopped the car carrying the two RUC officers at a roadblock and four armed men emerged from a van which pulled up close by and opened fire immediately.  From a review of the relevant factors, Judge Cory considered that it might be said that the Provisional IRA did not need any assistance from within the Garda to carry out the ambush.  However, he also considered that a statement made by a former British intelligence agent who, in that capacity, is supposed to have become a member of the Provisional IRA, could be found to constitute evidence of collusion on the part of a Garda officer.  Accordingly, he concluded that there must be a public inquiry in this case and, in line with the Weston Park commitments, the Smithwick tribunal was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The tribunal has, since early 2006, been conducting its inquiries in private.  Given the importance that is attached to the subject matter of those inquiries, the Government considers it is appropriate that the Oireachtas and the public should have an indication of where the tribunal is currently placed in carrying out the mandate the Oireachtas has given to it.  It is my view and that of the Government that it serves the public interest to have at this stage information from the tribunal as to the current status of the inquiry.  With hindsight, it may have been a mistake in the original terms of reference to link the timing of an interim report to a number of public hearings having taken place.  I doubt very much that the House in 2005 would have envisaged at the time that this would mean it would hear nothing from the tribunal for six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I do not consider it unreasonable that the tribunal should be asked to report progress at this stage.  In so far as the proposed interim report is concerned, the motion does not seek to have the tribunal deal with the substance of the matters into which it is inquiring.  Rather, the purpose is for the tribunal to give the Oireachtas an indication of the numbers of persons granted representation, progress to date with its hearings and work, and other matters which the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Oireachtas.  As I have indicated, given that the tribunal intends to commence public hearings shortly, it would have been required to produce such a report in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I am anxious that the Smithwick tribunal should be facilitated to conduct and conclude its inquiries in as comprehensive a manner as is possible.  I consider, however, that it is helpful, especially to those most directly affected by these dreadful killings, for this House to indicate a timescale for that.  It is not in the public interest or in the interest of the families bereaved by this IRA atrocity that an inquiry should continue indefinitely.  The seriousness of the matters being investigated requires greater urgency than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">As I indicated, I have been informed by the chairman that he believes the tribunal will be in a position to complete its work in advance of the date now proposed.  I repeat that if a difficulty were to emerge subsequently with the target date for conclusion, I have no doubt that the chairman would report that difficulty and the Oireachtas would have the opportunity to consider the matter further.  It is against that background that the motion proposes the tribunal should conclude its work and report to the Clerk of the Dáil by 30 November 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Let me reiterate in no uncertain terms that there is no question of any political interference of any kind by me or by the Government with the tribunal.  I respect and defend fully the independence of the chairman of the tribunal to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour.  It is central to the remit of the tribunal that having completed its hearings it reaches its conclusions and finalises its report for submission to the Clerk of the Dáil without any interference of any nature or its independence being in any way compromised.  It is, however, in the public interest that its deliberations do not continue indefinitely with no public target date of any nature for the completion of its work and without accountability to this Parliament or explanation of any nature for the duration of its sitting.  After all, its original remit was to report on a "definite matter of urgent public importance" on which it is "to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit".  Moreover, its original terms of reference require that when it reports on "an interim basis" the tribunal must detail "the likely duration" in so far as it can estimate "of the proceedings of the tribunal".  There must be some accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the progress of its work and the public expenditure connected with it and this was clearly envisaged in the motion passed by this House to establish the tribunal on 23 March 2005, more than six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The chilling murders of these two honourable policemen serve as a reminder to us all of the critical importance to this island of the peace process.  It is the will of the people of this island, North and South, that such acts of criminal thuggery, and those who would carry them out or excuse them, should be consigned forever to the past.  There have been too many victims on this island and we need no more.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Oireachtas established the public inquiry into the brutal murders of these two RUC officers, not just out of an obligation imposed by Judge Cory's report, but more importantly, out of a genuine desire to see the truth emerge, in so far as that can be done.  We owe this to the families left behind, to the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, to the people of this jurisdiction.  The families of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan have waited long enough for this aspect of these horrific events to be addressed and they deserve to see the full truth emerge as soon as may be.  If I thought for one moment that the motion before this House today would interfere adversely with that process I would not have moved it nor would the House support it.  I am confident that the tribunal will fully discharge its responsibilities and that this motion will assist in that endeavour.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_413">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" where it firstly occurs and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_414">"notes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_415">the Oireachtas established the Smithwick Tribunal as a central part of the confidence-building measures which led to major breakthroughs in relations with key parts of the Unionist community;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_416">the work of the Tribunal demonstrates that the Irish Government is willing to open up to scrutiny all issues, no matter how potentially uncomfortable they are, concerning actions by the State and its officers in the decades before the ceasefires;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_417">while press briefings have explained the basis for the Government's proposal to curtail the work of the Tribunal, no information has been given to members of the Oireachtas; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_418">while legal costs must be addressed, no move should be made to curtail the work of the Tribunal without a detailed report being submitted to the Oireachtas justifying such a move and following a process of consultation with interested parties in Northern Ireland; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_419">resolves that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_420">the Minister for Justice and Equality should prepare for the Oireachtas a detailed report outlining all relevant information and arguments concerning the work of the Tribunal and how, if the work of the Tribunal is curtailed, he proposes to meet the central objective of reaching a clearer conclusion relating to the allegation of collusion; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_421">consultations be undertaken with all interested parties in advance of any proposal to curtail the work of the Tribunal being put to the House."</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The frustration over the tabling of the motion is that it has arrived so quickly in the aftermath of the Queen's visit, which was so successful in building further and stronger relations on the island.  The manner in which the motion has been introduced into the House seems completely inappropriate.  In his speech the Minister said it would not be appropriate for him to consult the tribunal in advance of this.  However, in the case of this tribunal, which is very different from the other tribunals we discuss regularly in this House, it would have been appropriate for him to take that step.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The publicity surrounding this motion has forced the chairman of the tribunal to write to the Minister as he has said.  From a BBC report today I understand the chairman of the tribunal has expressed concern over the change in the remit of the inquiry and that he is concerned about the deadline.  In his speech the Minister referred to the chairman's communication, and when he is wrapping up I would appreciate if he would outline to the House the concerns the chairman expressed and his responses to those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">This Smithwick tribunal is a very different one.  It was set up as part of an international agreement signed at Weston Park.  It is a very important signal that this part of the island takes claims about collusion within its security forces seriously.  As recently as two weeks ago the Dáil unanimously agreed a motion on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We cannot campaign about other allegations of collusion without being upfront about our own interest in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">While the tribunal has been sitting for a long time, when one considers the justifications for that duration, they are compelling.  The work of the tribunal is extremely complex and deals with several jurisdictions.  It cannot compel witnesses except in this jurisdiction.  It has to deal with, for example, army personnel who are based in England as well as retired police personnel who are in Northern Ireland.  It has to obtain documentation from the Northern Ireland Office, the British Ministry of Defence, the RUC and the Garda.  It covers the entire breadth and spectrum that have been under consideration in the various inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Given the background to the tribunal, politically and otherwise, and the complexity of its work, I believe the motion is rushed, which is why we have tabled the amendment before the House today.  I am anxious to support the work of the tribunal and support the Minister's efforts as he outlined in his speech.  We feel the Government can support the amendment without losing any face, especially given that both the Minister and the Taoiseach have said publicly that they are willing to revisit the motion if the tribunal has not completed its work by the deadline.  If they are willing to revisit the timing of a motion that has yet to be passed, then why pass the motion?</p>
          <p eId="para_427">According to the tribunal in a statement on 25 May, the chairman has not received any communication from the Government on what he described as the reported Government decision to amend the tribunal's terms of reference.  I gather he wrote to the Minister on 27 May to express his concerns over the potential impact of the decision we may be about to take in this House on the continuing work of the tribunal and has yet to receive a reply.  Given that lack of interaction between the Minister or his officials and the tribunal, it is incredible that this is being tabled with only 48 hours notice, without any background papers having been made available to either Deputy O'Brien or me on what he has just said.  There has been a tradition of briefing Opposition spokespersons on sensitive issues.  Had this been done in this case, we might have managed to reach some sort of agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I believe that the Minister does not wish to undermine the inquiry, but the pressures in terms of putting a deadline on the work will do so whether he intends it or not.  No time or cost restrictions were placed, for instance, on the Bloody Sunday inquiry and when this tribunal is considered in terms of dealing with people's lives and dealing with families, it is completely different from the other tribunals that are under discussion in this House and many of those tribunals were not forced to curtail their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I agree with the Minister that we need to give the families some sort of closure and some answers.  However, I direct the Minister to comments made by the solicitor for Chief Superintendent Breen's family that the concerns the tribunal chairman has expressed must be taken seriously.  He stated, "I think it would be enormously discourteous for the Department of Justice, for the Minister responsible for that department, and for the wider cabinet in fact, to ignore concerns expressed by Judge Smithwick."  That is the solicitor for the family.  That is the only reaction we have heard from one of the families involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I agree we should not interfere — nobody wants to — but the placing of this motion before the House in the manner in which it has been placed has caused interference and has forced the tribunal chairman into conflict with the Oireachtas.  That conflict is unnecessary and will impede the work of the tribunal.  This House collectively agrees with the need for the tribunal and the concerns of the families, and it acknowledges the sadness of the latter.  I ask the Government to support our amendment so we can further the work of the inquiry in a far more appropriate manner.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_431">During the most recent phase of the conflict, more than 3,500 people lost their lives.  While the armed conflict has ended, the process of conflict resolution in Ireland is far from over.  Many families are still grieving and are still seeking answers regarding the deaths of their loved ones.  They and their families all deserve the truth.  Sinn Féin fully supports their quest for truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Sinn Féin has consistently supported inquiries, including the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday and the inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson.  We have also given our ongoing support for the campaign by the family of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane and the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy and Springhill massacres.  In 2008, Sinn Féin supported the unanimous request of the Oireachtas to allow independent, international access to all original documents held by the British Government relating to fatal attacks in the Twenty-six Counties involving collusion between British state forces and Unionist paramilitaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Last month, Sinn Féin tabled a Private Members' motion in this House reiterating the all-party resolution of 10 July 2008 that called on the British Government to release all files relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings for scrutiny by the inquiry team.  It is widely believed that these bombings, involving the greatest loss of life of any incident in the conflict, were carried out with the involvement of British intelligence.  The Oireachtas committee severely reprimanded the former British Government for its refusal to establish an inquiry, as called for by the Oireachtas, into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It goes further and states the Northern Ireland Office and the PSNI refused to co-operate in any meaningful way with the Barron investigation or with the work of the Oireachtas committee.  To date, no action has been taken despite the motion receiving unanimous backing from all parties in this House.  It is for this reason that we submitted the Private Members' motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">We strongly repudiate the rejection by the British Prime Minister of the Taoiseach's request for London to release the files to the inquiry and again urge the Taoiseach to continue to press this matter directly with the British Prime Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Sinn Féin has proposed the establishment of an independent, international truth-recovery process convened under the auspices of a credible, international third party, such as the United Nations, as another step in the peace process.  The process should be victim-centred and involve all participants to the conflict here in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">No one who has seriously studied the Irish conflict doubts that there was systematic collusion between British forces and Unionist paramilitaries.  The most murderous loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association, which operated under the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, was co-founded in 1971 by Charles Harding Smith, a self-confessed British intelligence agent.  The British army's military reaction force was established by Brigadier Frank Kitson, a leading British counter-insurgency officer, to co-ordinate the British military and loyalist death squads.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Throughout the conflict, British forces were guided by the British army's training manual <i>Land Operations, Volume III, Counter Revolutionary Operations, Part 3 — Counter Insurgency Options</i>, which defines its role as “liaison with, and organization, training and control of, friendly guerrilla forces operating against the common enemy”.  That is the institutionalised and administrative basis of collusion.  It is not ancient history but has been relevant right up to the present day.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">In an attempt to prevent the truth being revealed, the British Government introduced what is commonly known as the inquiries Bill, which was designed to prevent any realistic inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane or that of any other victim of collusion between British Crown forces and loyalist death squads.  That legislation empowers a British Minister to order an inquiry to be held behind closed doors.  Judge Peter Cory has severely criticised this legislation.  He has advised his colleague judges in Canada not to participate in any inquiry under such legislation.  British Ministers and British security and military agencies will still have the controlling hand when it comes to the release of information.  We have seen how they have used that power.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal into the alleged collusion of a member or members of An Garda Síochána in the killing in 1989 of senior RUC officers Harry Breen and Robert Buchanan.  Sinn Féin has stated previously in this House that anyone with relevant information should come forward and assist this tribunal.  We reiterate that call today.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The decision by the Government to seek an interim report from the tribunal by 30 June and a final report by 30 November of this year is a mistake that will feed the conspiracy theories that the Government and the Garda may have something to hide.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Arguments over costs sound petty and irresponsible when set against the desire of two families to know how their loved ones died.  The tragic loss of all those who died in the political conflict on this island should be acknowledged and remembered.  The grief of their relatives and friends must be acknowledged also.  The victims were men, women, children, civilians and members of all the armed groups involved in the conflict.  It is for these reasons that Sinn Féin opposes the Government's motion.  We support the amendment tabled.  However, those of us charged with political responsibility must agree upon and deliver a truth-recovery process that is meaningful and substantive.  There is an onus on all political leaders to promote this.  That means thinking beyond any sectarian, sectional or party-political interest, or self-interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The discharge of these responsibilities needs to be rooted in the political dispensation agreed on Good Friday 1998.  The British Government has the major financial, moral and political responsibility to facilitate and enable such a process.  The Irish Government has a constitutional, legal and moral responsibility to promote actively and encourage this course of action.  Party leaders and civic society should get fully behind the call for an effective truth-recovery initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I concur with Deputy Calleary that it is regrettable that the Opposition spokespersons had only 48 hours' notice of this motion.  We received no briefings or materials to explain the urgency of its being tabled.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_444">The Smithwick tribunal is very important and comprises an important aspect of finding out what happened in our troubled history and in the conflict that took place on this island.  It is vital that the families affected see a full and complete report and are satisfied that, if collusion took place, it is recognised and acknowledged by this State.  It is also vital in the context of the other inquiries we have sought and the integrity of the entire process.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The motion calls into question the integrity and wishes of this House.  A couple of weeks ago we passed a motion calling on the British Parliament to make available the files in London on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Two short weeks later, however, we turn around and place a motion before the House that will effectively guillotine the work the Smithwick tribunal.  When we do not complete inquiries ourselves and provide answers, no matter how unpalatable they might be and no matter what questions arise, it sends out the wrong message to people who are concerned and who attempt to highlight the fact that we want the British authorities to acknowledge any part they played in colluding with the paramilitaries on their side in the conflict.  We have an obligation to ensure the inquiry is completed and given all the time it needs to produce a complete report outlining all its views.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Given the visit of the British Queen recently and this attempt to guillotine the work of the Smithwick tribunal I wonder if an attempt is being made to draw a line under the peace process, say it is done and dusted, there is peace in the Six Counties and we need to move on to other work.  Judging by the haste with which this motion was brought forward after the visit of the Queen, it appears the Government's intention is to ensure that we do not spend any more time looking into these issues that remain vitally important for many people and many families who have questions that must be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The Minister stated in his contribution that if the tribunal believes it needs more time in the coming months it can come back to the House and request an extension of the time period but why does the motion not include that provision?  It should include a section allowing either the Ceann Comhairle or the Clerk of the Dáil to grant the tribunal extra time if it puts that case to them.  If that provision were included in the motion it might make it somewhat more acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Minister should have consulted with the tribunal before bringing this motion before the House.  If it is the Minister's responsibility to bring forward the motion surely he has a responsibility to ask the tribunal for its views on it and what it perceives will be the time required to complete its investigations and present a report to the House.  The setting of this deadline sends out the message that we want to curtail this work, it is an artificial deadline.  Even if, as the Minister stated, the inquiry can appeal for extra time this motion sets a deadline in the minds of the people who have to give evidence before the tribunal and whose views will have to be taken into account in the final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">It is wrong to bring this motion before the House, and it should be rejected.  The Minister should consult with the inquiry, determine the extra time it needs and put a motion before the House that allows for that extra time, if it is required.  That would send out the message that we are giving this inquiry the time it needs to produce a full and frank report on the facts of this case.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_193" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_452">I am not sure I can deal with all of this in five minutes but I will do my best.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I will begin by responding to the amendment Deputy Calleary has tabled and to what was said by Members of the House.  Clearly, those who spoke were not listening to what I said when I explained the reason for the moving of the motion.  We cannot accept Deputy Calleary's amendment and I want to draw particular reference to the content of it.  He is asking for the House to resolve that "the Minister for Justice and Equality should prepare for the Oireachtas a detailed report outlining all relevant information and arguments concerning the work of the Tribunal".  That is the first part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">With regard to the work of the tribunal, neither myself nor Deputy Calleary are engaged in the work of the tribunal, and properly so.  This motion seeks to require the tribunal, by the end of June, to furnish us details of its workings.  This is a tribunal that has sat in private for six years and has not yet held a substantive oral hearing.  We have a duty to the bereaved families of these two RUC officers to ascertain background to where the tribunal now stands procedurally in meeting its obligations pursuant to the motion tabled by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The amendment tabled by Fianna Fáil refers in two different parts to the work of the tribunal being curtailed and wants consultations to be undertaken in advance of any proposals to curtail the work.  I have made it resolutely clear that this is not about curtailing the work.  This is about ensuring that this tribunal is meeting its obligations pursuant to the motions passed in this House and in the Seanad over six years ago in circumstances in which there has not been even the commencement of an oral hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I noticed that all of the Deputies who expressed opposition to this motion failed to mention the fact that the original motion envisaged that after ten days of oral hearings there would be an interim report.  I am presuming those Deputies do not oppose an interim report being given to this House and this motion will facilitate an interim report being produced within four weeks after the oral hearings have commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The second aspect, and the question I was asked by the last speaker, concerns the reason this motion does not state that if the tribunal requires additional time it can write to the Clerk of the Dáil, correspond with Members of the House or do something or other.  It is because it is not necessary.  This tribunal has within its terms of reference the capacity to communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas if it needs to do so.  In the context of the time-line prescribed, I reiterate it is a time-line that Mr. Justice Smithwick indicated prior to the motion being he believes he will meet.  I do not know if he will meet it but he has indicated he will meet it and in that context we believed it was reasonable that after six years there would be some public transparency with regard to both an interim report and when the final report might be expected.  Procedurally, if this tribunal gets into difficulty it is open to the tribunal to communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas and as I have already stated, if it cannot complete its work under the remit given to it, and if there is good reason it cannot, in those circumstances it is clear the Government will move an appropriate motion in this House.  In so far as anyone is suggesting that anything is being done to interfere with the integrity of the tribunal, undermine the work of the tribunal or prevent the tribunal in its own judgment reporting to this House expressing opinions and making recommendations as prescribed by the motion, it is an incorrect presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">It is correct that the lawyer representing the bereaved family of one of the deceased RUC officers has expressed public concern about this matter in Northern Ireland.  I was engaged with him in a broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland and I repeated what I have said in this House.  All I can do is repeat those assurances.  These two RUC officers suffered a barbaric death at the hands of those who were responsible for their deaths.  After six years of this tribunal being in place this Government wants to ensure that, in terms of any suspicion or suggestion of any description that anyone associated with or a member of the Garda Síochána was in any way complicit in their deaths, we know what the position is and the conclusions of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Deputy Calleary suggested that I had received a communication from the Chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Smithwick, to which no reply had been sent.  I have received a communication from Mr. Justice Smithwick since the moving of this motion became known and a reply has been sent and there has been an exchange of correspondence between us.  I have no difficulty, when that correspondence is concluded, in placing that correspondence in the Library of this House.  The original correspondence I received from him was marked private and confidential.  As I understand it, as of today, he now has no objection to that correspondence being made public.  Transparency in this matter is very important because I do not want there to be any suspicion of any description that this Government, or I as Minister, have in any way interfered with the proper workings of the tribunal and therefore when that correspondence is concluded, it will be put on the record of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">In the light of what I have said I am hoping that Deputy Calleary may decide not to divide the House on this issue.  This House was united in setting up this tribunal.  I believe we have a duty to the bereaved families of these two brutally assassinated RUC officers.  We have a public duty to people on this island and in this State to ensure that when a tribunal is established, it does not have an indefinite duration to continue with work in private and never report to the Houses of the Oireachtas or give some indication on whether progress is being made, on the likely time needed to complete its work, and the number of witnesses that may be called.  These are all issues to which there is no clarity at the moment.  The interim report will provide that clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The motion that is passed will focus on the serious, substantive issues that this tribunal has been asked to address.  I hope it proves possible for this tribunal to complete its work within the time prescribed.  As a Member of this House and as a former practising lawyer, I am conscious that all sorts of issues could arise which may make it impossible for the tribunal to meet that timeline.  If so, this House will be asked to take appropriate action to ensure the tribunal fully completes its work and has the time available to do so.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_749">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Bill before us is the first step towards creation of a revitalised and customer-focused public service and towards placing a stronger focus on how we manage our public expenditure to get the best possible impact from available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Turning first to the reform agenda, we will build a more efficient public service which will be manifestly fit for purpose and which will deliver the essential services we all need in the most integrated, transparent and accountable manner possible.  This is my vision for the reformed public service, a vision built upon the traditional public service values of integrity, impartiality, diligence and commitment.  We will focus on what is needed to help rebuild public confidence in the institutions of the State and make a positive contribution to economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The process towards achieving this vision has already begun.  As Deputies will be aware, a highly significant programme of public service reform has been initiated by the new Government.  We spoke about some of this during the debate on Private Members' business yesterday evening.  This process will take place alongside an ambitious programme of constitutional and political institutional reform.  There will be a fundamental change in democratic and public governance; and a dramatic change in the cost efficiency and methods of delivery of public services.  It is clear that notwithstanding developments to date, the cost of delivering public services must be reduced further, with fewer staff and tighter budgets, and that the public service must become better integrated and more customer focused, as well as being leaner and more efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Before I proceed to outline the details of individual provisions of the Bill, it is important to restate the objectives of the public service reform process on which we have already embarked, and to provide an update on the steps taken to date or that are under way towards making the vision a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The Government is committed to the fundamental review, reform and overhaul of all aspects of Government and administration in Ireland.  The establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reinforces the political and economic importance attached to delivering on the broad reform agenda, and the role which the Government believes a streamlined and highly performing public service can play in our national recovery.  Work is already under way to give effect to the reform commitments the Government has made to the people and the Bill marks the final part of the beginning of a challenging journey to achieve the vision we have set ourselves and which the people fully deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The programme for Government also envisages a renewed focus on a range of related reform issues, including legislative changes to facilitate more open, transparent and better government, an increased focus on organisational and individual performance improvement, giving citizens greater choice and input into service delivery, and a more empowered, skilled and customer-focused public service to deliver on all of these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">We need to build upon the undoubted commitment and ability of public servants at all levels to foster a culture of high-performance, flexibility, openness and accountability.  The importance of rebuilding public confidence in the institutions of the State cannot be over-estimated.  We must make better use of our resources, and draw more efficiently on the potential that exists to improve sharing of public information.  We are determined to maximise the dividend from ICT, in terms of reducing the labour intensity of service delivery, by promoting the wide-scale adoption of shared services in human resources, payroll, pension, financial management, payment services and so on; business process improvement; and increased online delivery of services and payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Leadership will also be essential, and the newly established senior public service will play a key role in developing our cadre of public service leaders.  Yesterday, I had the privilege of speaking to the first forum of the senior public service because I took the opportunity of the recall of all of our ambassadors so we had the widest possible cross-section of senior officials in public administration in the country.  This will involve empowering and equipping public servants and releasing their potential to become more flexible and more proactive in changing what they do and how they do it.  I am very open to ideas coming from people on the ground who can see around them the changes that are needed and who are now beginning to feel they have the flexibility to speak out.  I want to devolve authority to people to make decisions and be accountable, and give the freedom to people to disagree with politicians and political leaders so there will be proper debate and scrutiny of public decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Delivering such a programme of reform in the coming years will not be easy.  However, the passing of the Bill will represent a highly significant important step in this process.  It will provide the critical impetus for reform that is needed and will facilitate an integrated, focused and co-ordinated approach, and it is highly significant that the Bill places public service reform functions on a statutory basis for the first time.  This is extraordinary but it is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">As well as having a defined role in public expenditure issues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be in a position to place the issue of reform at the centre of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Members opposite have commented that during the last election campaign the issue of reform was very high on the electorate's agenda for the first time.  We must ensure the diverse elements of the public service move in a common direction with a determined purpose to deliver the public service Ireland needs and deserves, namely, a changed, more effective and less costly public service and a public service operating under a new legislative framework designed to promote a new culture of performance and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">In tandem with the extensive public service modernisation reforms being pursued, the Government has an ambitious agenda for budgetary consolidation over the coming years to put our public finances back on a sound footing.  This will involve further major savings in the expenditure area, coming on top of the expenditure consolidations of the past two and a half years.  This will impact on individuals and families.  We have seen the consequences of that but this process must be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">To lay the groundwork for these expenditure savings, the Government is taking a forensic approach through a comprehensive review of expenditure to ensure that the savings are prepared rationally and with regard to the priorities set in a negotiated programme for Government rather than just apply <i>pro rata </i>top slicing across all programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The comprehensive review will draw on international experience in this area, including the Canadian programme review approach of the 1990s, at which I looked, and the UK comprehensive spending reviews.  This is an acceptance that as a country we cannot afford the same level of services and that prioritisation — and re-prioritisation — is now required.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In parallel with the comprehensive review of expenditure, the Government is also reforming and modernising the entire system of budgetary management.  Under our government programme and the EU-IMF agreement, this Government is committed to introducing an independent fiscal advisory council.  This should be in place by the summer on an interim basis.  A fiscal responsibility Bill will include numerical fiscal rules and provide for a medium-term fiscal framework.  As part of that framework, we will set out multi-annual expenditure ceilings.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The comprehensive review of expenditure will be instrumental in laying the groundwork for this initiative.  The fiscal responsibility Bill is already at an advanced stage and will be published before year's end.  The Bill will also reflect the new EU fiscal governance arrangements which, as Deputies know, are in the process of being finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The reform agenda and the comprehensive spending review, which I outlined, set out what needs to be done to deliver a more effective public service for the people and businesses.  The framework for how this change agenda will be delivered is provided by the Croke Park agreement.  The significance of that agreement is rooted in the reality that the scale of the desired changes and reforms cannot simply be imposed on a system of more than 300,000 people without their agreement, active engagement and co-operation and without proactive and ambitious leadership at every level in public service bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Under the agreement, public service unions have fully accepted that the guarantees the Government has given to avoid pay reductions and-or compulsory redundancies are dependent on driving forward implementation of the programme of modernisation and improvements in productivity against the backdrop of significantly reducing financial and staff resources.  In practice, that means that staff need to be willing to retrain, where necessary, to take on more responsibility, to work across professional and technical boundaries and to be open to travelling within a radius of 45 km to take up new positions in a more flexible mobile public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">It is also clear that the agreement can serve as an effective enabler of economic recovery by helping to create greater stability and certainty and, above all, a climate of industrial peace — necessary conditions under which difficult decisions can be taken and, more important, fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">My Department has a key role to play in driving implementation of the Croke Park agreement working closely with the implementation body chaired by Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick.  Over recent weeks, the implementation body has been engaged in an intensive review of progress to date under the agreement and is in the process of completing its assessment.  The body's report will be considered by Government and published shortly and I look forward to having the chance to debate that in this House.  I am confident the report will show that considerable savings and efficiencies have been achieved under the framework of the Croke Parkagreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">We know, for example, despite a fall in the number of public servants of more than 16,400 since the end of 2008 and which has led to considerable payroll savings, services are, by and large, being maintained and, in some cases, being improved or even expanded.  We also know of examples of major changes in the health sector and the Civil Service such as the reform of the medical laboratories, the transfer of the community welfare service to the Department of Social Protection and the management of the accelerated voluntary departure schemes from the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Government has made it clear that it wishes to honour the commitments given in the agreement.  However, that will only be possible if the agreement is implemented in full.  Notwithstanding the progress to date, it is clear that much more needs to be done.  There are enormous pressures on us to cut expenditure significantly and to reduce the size of the public service while at the same time making every effort to minimise the negative impact on services.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">In the programme for Government, we have set down targets to further reduce the number of public servants by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the number at the end of 2010, and by a further 4,000 by 2015.  The framework provided by the Croke Park agreement will be critical to achieving these challenging targets and the savings that derive from such a cut in numbers.  If services to the public, business and the community are to be maintained with significantly fewer staff and significantly less resources, we will need to see accelerated delivery of the full range of reform and efficiencies envisaged under the agreement such as much greater integration of public service organisations so that services are designed around the practical needs of the citizen; the better targeting of services in order that we avoid duplication of effort; accelerated progress in the area of e-Government in order that we deliver faster service to the user, minimise opportunities for fraud and reduce transaction costs for the Exchequer; and the consolidation, as far as possible, of financial, payroll, procurement, pensions and human resource services in each sector as well as the processing of standardised information such as medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I hardly need to remind Deputies of the difficult economic background against which this reform agenda is being undertaken.  Unfortunately, everybody in the House is fully aware of that.  We find ourselves facing unprecedented economic challenges.  Gross domestic product — the most comprehensive measure of economy activity in Ireland — has fallen in each of the past three years.  The labour market has borne the brunt of this adjustment and, as Deputies are all aware, unemployment has risen sharply.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Having said that, the recent flow of economic data provides some grounds for cautious optimism.  The recovery is being led by developments in the external sector.  What we are seeing is a substantial improvement in our competitiveness — we are pricing our way back into foreign markets.  This is generating higher exports and boosting inward direct investment.  Last year exports increased by 9.5% which was the strongest rate of growth in a decade.  In other words, we are beginning to trade our way out of recession.  While the outlook for the external sector remains bright, domestic demand conditions are likely to remain muted and flat, at least in the short-term.  Over time, sustained strong export growth will help raise overall employment levels and I hope put unemployment on a downward path.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The measures outlined in the Government's recent jobs initiative will also help to underpin the labour market.  However, we cannot rely on the external sector alone.  The public service must also play its part.  We must be ambitious and ensure the reform initiatives we are undertaking, informed by the outcome of the comprehensive expenditure review and delivered within the Croke Park agreement, deliver a slimmer, more streamlined, efficient and effective public service.  That is what we must achieve.</p>

        <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b>
          if he will outline in further detail the proposal in the jobs initiative that the Dublin Airport Authority will rebate substantial levels of airport charges to airlines in return for additional passengers.

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_199">
            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)</from>
            <p eId="para_777">The Government's recent jobs initiative includes a three-pronged strategy to encourage inbound tourism.  The first element is the proposed abolition of the €3 travel tax; the second is a new growth incentive scheme recently introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA; and the third is a more targeted co-operative marketing of new air routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, the DAA and the airlines.  My officials and I have held a number of discussions in recent weeks with the DAA and the four main Irish airlines about this initiative, and I have also written to all the other airlines operating services to and from State airports.  The response has been broadly positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">The DAA's growth incentive scheme is due to run for the period 2011-14.  Passenger service charges at the three State airports will be rebated to the airlines once the threshold of the previous year's traffic total has been surpassed at the airport in question.  The rebates to airlines will be in line with their contribution to the overall growth at the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The Finance (No. 2) Bill is currently being debated in the House and will make legislative provision for the suspension of the travel tax.  The Government is only prepared to commence this provision if the airlines demonstrate a willingness to respond positively to these initiatives.  This position will continue to be reviewed in the context of traffic performance in the current year as well as stated plans by airlines for growth in future years.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_200">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_780">The new incentive is based on passenger numbers for the previous year.  However, there has already been a considerable increase in numbers in the year to date, in the region of 4% or 5% across the airports, in line with a growth in economic activity in areas outside this jurisdiction.  In light of that, is it wise to use 2010 as the base level against which a rebate will be given to the airlines?  One must take into consideration that passenger numbers were depressed last year as a result of disruption arising from the volcanic ash cloud.  Would there be a better saving for the Dublin Airport Authority if there were a nominal growth level and an adjusted figure for 2010 to take account of the depressed figures arising from the ash cloud?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_201" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_781">The figures for this year so far may be somewhat misleading in that the numbers are down across the three airports, particularly Shannon and Cork.  The numbers were down for January, February and March, but up for April as a consequence of low figures for last year as a result of the ash cloud disruption, and will probably be up for May for the same reason.  It will be interesting to see whether they are up in June, July and August.  The increase thus far this year arises from the relatively low figures for the corresponding periods of last year when there was disruption due to the ash cloud.  We will have a better idea in June or July whether passenger numbers are rising anyway apart from this factor.  A major aspect of the decline in passenger numbers is the reduction in domestic travel, and this will further reduce when the PSOs end in July.  In the absence of an incentive, most commentators would expect the figures to be quite flat this year.  That is why we are introducing this incentive.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">It was the DAA which proposed that 2010 be set as the baseline.  Under the old scheme it was 2010 adjusted for the effect of the volcanic cloud.  When we asked the authority to come up with a more attractive airline incentive scheme it proposed that the unadjusted 2010 figures be used as the baseline.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_202">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_783">The Minister's discussions with other airlines are welcome.  We understandably tend to focus on our own airlines, but many tourists are attracted to this country through non-national airlines.  Engagement with the latter should continue in order to encourage inbound tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">What impact will the incentive scheme have on the fiscal position of the DAA?  We hear regularly about the authority's difficulties in terms of its continued financing of its debt.  Has the Minister sought to have any analysis carried out on the impact of the scheme on the viability of the company and, in particular, on its debt rating and on the re-servicing of its debt if that becomes a requirement in due course?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_203" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_785">On the first point, I have had discussions with the chief executive officers of Aer Lingus, CityJet, Ryanair and Aer Arann, as well as the chairpersons of three of those airlines.  I have been in correspondence with the international airlines.  Engagement with the latter is important because just as Irish people tend to fly with Irish airlines, even in these modern times, so too do people from Germany, France or wherever tend to fly with their own airlines.  Non-national airlines, therefore, are particularly important in terms of attracting inbound tourists.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">In coming up with the incentive scheme the DAA looked at the issues as to its own financial position, as did the board, before it was signed off.  My guidance comes from the DAA in that regard and if it is satisfied the scheme will not damage its financial position then I too am satisfied.  There is no point in having an incentive scheme which damages the DAA itself and the future of the airports it manages.  It is a case of finding a balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">It is always a challenge with issues like these where, for example, a company which is in trouble or is losing business may succumb to the initial temptation to increase prices and charges in a bid to attract more revenue.  The risk in that strategy, however, is that one may lose customers.  That is the decision-making process we have to go through.  The DAA did that work itself before its board signed off on the growth scheme.  On that basis I am satisfied there are no concerns about the authority's financial position arising from this scheme.  Moreover, there must be growth before the incentive even comes into play.  If there is no increase in passenger numbers, passenger revenues and commercial revenues then the scheme will not come into effect.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanKelly" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_204">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Alan Kelly)</from>
            <p eId="para_789">The Government recently announced a comprehensive review of capital spending which is now under way.  The review will examine capital proposals across all sectors of the economy to establish a set of priority projects and programmes that will support economic recovery and provide new employment opportunities.  The results will form the basis of a new national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The preparation of the new framework requires that my Department reviews all existing projects and programmes.  The review will also need to take account of new funding realities.  A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.  This will of necessity restrict the funding for new projects, with only those offering the highest return having any prospect of being prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">As part of the review process all agencies funded by my Department have been requested to make submissions supporting their programmes and setting  priorities in a scenario of reduced allocations.  Submissions have recently been received from the National Transport Authority, Railway Procurement Agency and Iarnród Éireann in regard to public transport projects.  These submissions are being examined by my officials and will inform my Department's conclusions on  the capital review.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">I will not speculate on the outcome of the review.  However, I have already stated that, given funding constraints and the uncertainty about the availability of private funding for major infrastructure projects, it is likely that only one of the major Dublin projects can proceed in the period to 2016.  I will seek to secure that outcome if at all possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_205">
            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_793">The last time I raised this matter I was told that these three projects were the only projects under consideration.  Now there is some indication that a fourth project, linking Malahide to the airport, may be in contention.  This project will not serve the communities along the route from Drumcondra out to Swords, including Ballymun and Santry, in which we are seeking to get the best returns.  The objective is to get as many cars off the road as possible by providing a proper public transport system.  The northside of Dublin has been left behind in comparison with other areas.  People are not aware that metro north alone has already cost €150 million.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_795">It is absolutely scandalous.  Some €45 million has been spent on preparatory work for the DART underground project and a further €8 million or €9 million on the Luas BXD proposal.  The Government has promised it will undertake one of these three projects.  I urge that we proceed with the one that gives us the most, including the most jobs.  The Government is always talking about jobs.  The returns from metro north are huge for the communities it will serve.  I urge the Government to look at that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly</from>
            <p eId="para_796">To clarify, there are four projects in the mix, as we have stated clearly on several occasions.  After the spending review, after the information has been provided to the Department and the process has gone through the Government, we will hopefully be in a position to go ahead with one of them.  We are aware of all the issues raised by the Deputy, particularly those concerning north Dublin, and we will do our best to ensure the decision made will facilitate the best project within the Government's limitations.  All variables will be taken into consideration but this is about thinking about the future and providing transport infrastructure in Dublin.  That will be one of the main components.</p>

            <p eId="para_800">All variables will be taken into consideration.  All the projects have merit in what they are trying to achieve.  We are aware that the project to which Deputy Ellis refers has great merit.  The cost benefit analysis across all projects is quite good and we will take that into account.  It is incumbent on us to examine all projects.  A fourth project has been brought to our attention and we are examining it.  It is our intention to pick the best project from the four to ensure it facilitates people in Dublin.  As a consequence, this will entail a considerable amount of work.  We will choose this to the best of our ability and all variables will be taken on board.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_802">Dún Laoghaire Harbour is owned and operated by a commercial State company.  The primary responsibility for the development of the harbour lies with the company, on behalf of the State.   The company is unique among the ten State port companies in that, while its main income stream is still from commercial shipping, the harbour is also the State's largest marine leisure amenity.  In addition, the harbour is an important maritime heritage site and is host to what is reputed to be the nation's most popular walk.  The company successfully manages these multiple roles and continues to invest in the amenity value of the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">The company is currently in the process of preparing a master plan for the future development of the harbour.

I encourage the many stakeholders in the harbour to participate positively in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">The business is facing a substantial reduction in its commercial shipping revenue this year.  It has been preparing for this eventuality for the last number of years by pursuing a twin strategy of developing alternative income streams from marine leisure and tourism related business, while also reducing its cost base.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">Following a public consultation on national ports policy last year, it is my intention to publish a revised ports policy document later this year.  This will provide a renewed policy framework for any future decisions on individual ports, such as Dún Laoghaire.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">I am sure the Minister has read the McCarthy report, which has yet to be discussed in the Dáil.  It "recommends that privatisation of some or all of the ports should be considered, ideally after the recommended restructuring".  I would like an assurance from the Minister and the Government that there will be absolutely no question of selling Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which the Minister correctly indicated is one of the most important amenity harbours in the country.  It is of historic, cultural, heritage and economic value to Dún Laoghaire, a town that is in considerable economic difficulty.  I would like the Minister to assure us there will be no consideration given to the sale of the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The Minister referred to the efforts of the harbour company to reduce its cost base.  Some aspects of that are worrying and might imply to workers and locals that the restructuring prior to possible privatisation is already under way.  For example, five harbour police had their jobs axed recently, with a detrimental effect on the security to walkers and users of the port.  Other workers were supposed to enjoy the protection of the Harbours Act, having been transferred when the port moved from direct Government ownership to semi-State status.  They were given protection under the Harbours Act in terms of pay and conditions but were recently asked to accept a 35% pay cut, while the management of the harbour company is refusing to entertain pay cuts for management.</p>

That is the point of the master plan.  We will launch the master plan consultation in the coming weeks.  Everyone will be invited to participate.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">In respect of ports, the McCarthy report recommends that they be consolidated into three port companies — Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes — and that privatisation be considered at a later stage.  The Government is considering the McCarthy report and has made no decision on it.  It will be further down the line before the Government is in a position to publish its views on the recommendations of the McCarthy report.  That is under discussion at departmental and Cabinet level and it would be wrong of me to prejudice the outcome of those discussions and deliberations.  The restructuring of the port is in no way connected to any possible privatisation in the future.  The restructuring is taking place because the port needs to match its expenditure with its income.  It is a port company and a business that must match expenditure with income.  That is why the workforce is being reduced from 42 to 26 and why there are discussions at the LRC.  The LRC is the right place for that work to be done on how further savings can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to people who were previously civil servants.  They have special protection under the Harbours Act but it is up to the Minister for Finance to make a determination on their tenure, under section 39(3) of the Harbours Act, after consulting me.  No process has commenced in that respect.  Those who were previously civil servants and transferred to the port company did not have the pension levy or the public sector pay cut applied to them in the way it was applied to current public servants.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">All of the €75 million provided for transport projects under the jobs initiative was reallocated from existing funds within my Department's overall capital allocation as follows.  Some €40 million savings on the national roads budget for 2011 had been provided for close-out payments on projects already completed and is not now required in 2011.  Some €10 million savings came from Luas projects due to appropriate substitution by unused section 49 levies, €11 million savings came from purchases of equipment including the  purchase of new buses now due for delivery in 2012 instead of 2011, €7 million savings due on allocations for  metro north and the Marlborough Street bridge projects due to revised work programmes and delays, €7 million saving on allocations for contingency and for design and planning of public transport projects, amounting to €75 million.  This was identified for reallocation following a detailed review by my Department of all capital allocations for 2011 in consultation with relevant agencies funded by my Department.  The €75 million has now been allocated to shovel-ready labour-intensive transport projects, which will create approximately 1,000  jobs in 2011.   Of the total, €60 million has been provided to local authorities to repair regional and local roads across Ireland damaged in the past two severe winters, along with €15 million for improvements to train stations, traffic management and smarter travel projects, mainly in cities and towns, to facilitate public transport users, pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">Will the Minister provide more detail on the €40 million from the national roads projects?  From what projects was the money saved?  I am familiar with a number of national road projects which are shovel-ready, with some in my constituency.  I do not want to be parochial but the council is having difficulty having safety works carried out.  Recently there was an accident, which could have been more serious, when a car toppled from the road into a water course.  I understand it has not been possible to get funding from the National Roads Authority, NRA, because it did not have the appropriate funding identified early in the budgeting process.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">I welcome funding being made available more quickly to shovel-ready projects but there are some within the national roads programme which could have received some of that money.  I am somewhat confused that the NRA had money lying around and was not able to allocate it.  That seems to have been the position.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_821">With regard to the €40 million, this came from funding allocated to final close-out payments for motorways and the inter-urban motorway network in the main.  These final payments go to arbitration as costs are estimated in advance.  As it turned out, after arbitration less money was owed for those roads than was anticipated.  The decision was then to be made as to whether the €40 million would be reallocated to a small number of national road projects or spread across the 30 or so local authorities to allow them repair 1,000 km of local and regional roads.  On balance, it was preferable to spread the money over the approximately 1,000 km of local and regional roads that had to be repaired as opposed to just allocating the money to two or three national road projects that probably would not have even commenced this year.  Road maintenance can be done quickly but full new projects take time to commence.  Some local authorities have sought reallocation within the funds given to them and we are happy to consider that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_823">It is obvious that next year's centenary of the <i>Titanic</i> sailing presents significant opportunities for Irish tourism and work is already under way to ensure the benefits are maximised.  Tourism Ireland commenced its <i>Titanic</i> promotion activities last September with a week-long showcase in the Grand Central terminal in New York.  It has also set up a dedicated <i>Titanic</i> website and has brought overseas journalists to Cobh to highlight the links to the <i>Titanic</i>.  I understand that just last week, the agency met with the Cobh and harbour chamber of commerce to discuss future activity and has also met with the organisers of Cobh 100.  Similarly, I understand Fáilte Ireland is meeting with the town council in Cobh this week to explore how to develop a calendar of events around the centenary and promote these events to the overseas trade and media.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">With regard to co-operation with Northern Ireland, as the Deputy is aware, tourism was specifically identified in the Good Friday Agreement as one of the key areas for North-South co-operation, and consequently it is one of the sectors on which the North-South Ministerial Council meets in sectoral format, to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of tourism.  Arrangements are being finalised for the next meeting in sectoral format at which I will meet the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA.  With its historic connections to both Belfast and Cobh, the <i>Titanic</i> story is one with obvious potential for co-operation and I understand the agenda for the next sectoral meeting will permit discussion of major tourism events on the island next year, including the <i>Titanic</i> centenary.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">With regard to the budget for tourism-related promotion of the centenary, it is a matter for the agencies to decide on best use of resources.  I understand that their plans for this year include <i>Titanic</i>-related promotional activity as already outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_826">The anniversary of the <i>Titanic</i> is a fantastic opportunity to promote the island of Ireland and commemorate those who lost their lives.  The <i>Titanic</i> exhibition at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, which opened yesterday to mark the ship’s launch 100 years ago, should form part of a well-planned calendar of events next year.  It is essential that the overall <i>Titanic </i>2012 anniversary is presented as a complete package that ties in all the various aspects of the voyage and its relationship with different parts of the island, North and South, both in Belfast and Cobh.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The <i>Titanic</i> was Ireland’s most famous maritime export.  Given repeated Eurobarometer polls indicating the attraction of the sea and waterways for incoming tourists, has the Minister plans to develop further our harbours and marinas for tourism?</p>

            <p eId="para_828">I am sure the Deputy has seen it already but there is a website, <i>www.the-titanic.com</i>, which has much information and has been translated into a number of languages.  It is worth a visit.  We have plans to develop amenities at the harbours and ports.  There are regular grants for harbours to allow this development.  By and large, most of the resources must come from the port companies in the case of ports or the local authorities when it comes to harbours.  I agree with the Deputy’s basic sentiment that the <i>Titanic</i> centenary is a major opportunity for Ireland, both North and South, and we must consider our harbours in a different way.  In particular, we must build on the leisure and tourism opportunities deriving from them.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">This relates to the transfer of ownership of a building called Harbour Square on Crofton Road in Dún Laoghaire from Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for use as a new library headquarters.  I am not aware of any such proposal.  The company is currently doing a public consultation on a future master plan for the harbour.  The master plan will help ensure all the property owned by the company is put to optimum usage into the future.  Under section 15 of the Harbours Act 1996, decisions by the harbour company relating to the acquisition or disposal of land or buildings, either by sale or by lease, shall only be made by the company board.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_831">We probably do not have time to go into this proposal in detail but following the Minister's earlier comments about developing our ports and harbours and the need for tourism and jobs flowing from it, I ask him to consider seriously this proposal, which would ensure better deployment of existing resources to the benefit of tourism, the port and Dún Laoghaire generally.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently passed a capital budget of which I believe the Minister must approve before going through.  That is my understanding but that can be checked.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The capital budget includes one of the flagship projects of €35 million for a library headquarters in Moran Park, which is near the harbour.  This proposal is that we do not need to spend €35 million on a new library headquarters as there is an empty building owned by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company nearby in public ownership and which could be used for far lesser cost for this purpose.  The money which would then be available could be used to develop the Carlisle Pier project in Dún Laoghaire, containing a diaspora museum which could provide a significant boost to the area.  The harbour and heritage facilities would be developed and tourism would be boosted.  It would be a little like the <i>Titanic </i>proposals.  The money could also be made available for developing Moran Park as a central park and redeveloping the Dún Laoghaire baths, for which very little money has been allocated despite significant public demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">Will the Minister consider this as a better way to spend €35 million?  Will he use his influence to bring about joined-up thinking on the matter?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_834">As far as I understand it, the €35 million capital programme in the county council would be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government rather than me, unless it relates in particular to tourism.  From the information we have the council is proposing to build its own library headquarters in Moran Park, which is adjacent to the Royal Marine Hotel.  That is the council proposal and the port has not been asked to provide the office block as a library.  If the council were to approach the board of the port or me, we could give full consideration to the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">Ultimately, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is responsible for providing the library and it is up to its democratically elected councillors to decide where they want it to be located.  If they want to approach the port company through me, I would be happy to arrange a discussion.  The council has its own plans for the library.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is making a mistake.  I am for local democracy but an argument can sometimes be made for better use of resources.  We could get three amenities for the price of one because an empty building which is in State ownership could be used for a library headquarters, thereby freeing up €35 million to develop the amenities which have been strenuously demanded by local people.  It would represent value for money as well as providing a significant economic boost.  I ask the Minister to exert his influence on his colleagues in the Labour Party and Fine Gael who form the majority on the council to reconsider a potential waste of money.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">I have investigated the matter to the extent that I am aware of two aspects of it.  First, a democratically elected council has decided it wants to locate the library elsewhere and, second, even though part of this commercial building may be vacant it is already leased on commercial terms and is subject to a property agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a new procedure for answering oral questions by State agencies.  The chief executive of every State funded agency will be required to attend the relevant Oireachtas committee on a regular basis to answer oral parliamentary questions that can be submitted by any member.  There will also be a requirement that State agencies answer written questions within a specified number of Dáil sitting days.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Until these new procedures are designed and implemented, I have adopted a transitional arrangement for questions on issues which are the responsibility of agencies under the aegis of my Department.  Rather than seeking to have these questions disallowed, as was previously the case, I have been referring the questions to the relevant agencies for direct reply, and have been asking the Deputies concerned to revert to my office if a reply has not been received within ten days.  The House will appreciate that this approach lends itself well to written questions.  However, our procedures for oral questions allow for supplementary questioning and this is clearly not appropriate when the Minister is not responsible for the issue concerned.  I suggest therefore that Deputies put such questions down for written reply only,  as I clearly cannot deal with them in any detail in oral replies.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">I am embarrassed to admit my reply is the same as that given by the Minister to a previous question.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a new procedure for answering oral questions by State agencies.  The chief executive of every State funded agency will be required to attend the relevant Oireachtas committee on a regular basis to answer oral parliamentary questions that can be submitted by any member.  There will also be a requirement that State agencies answer written questions within a specified number of Dáil sitting days.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Until these new procedures are designed and implemented, I have adopted a transitional arrangement for questions on issues which are the responsibility of agencies under the aegis of my Department.  Rather than seeking to have these questions disallowed, as was previously the case, I have been referring the questions to the relevant agencies for direct reply, and have been asking the Deputies concerned to revert to my office if a reply has not been received within ten days.  The House will appreciate that this approach lends itself well to written questions.  However, our procedures for oral questions allow for supplementary questioning and this is clearly not appropriate when the Minister is not in fact responsible for the issue concerned.  I suggest therefore that Deputies put such questions down for written reply only,  as I clearly cannot deal with them in any detail in oral replies.    The subject matters of these particular questions, namely, the Garda vetting process as rolled out by the Irish Sports Council, women in sport and Ireland's representation at the London 2012 Olympics,  are the responsibility of the Irish Sports Council and I have referred the question to it for direct reply.  I ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply has not been received within ten days.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">The Minister of State's reply is a charade.  Question No. 34 asks the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sports his views on the relatively low number of women participating in sports and his plans for improving the level of participation.  I am sure that can be answered today rather than requiring another question be tabled.  The purpose of Question Time is to raise questions and receive answers to them.

            <p eId="para_866">Now that I am on this side, the problem is that legislation has been put in place giving the Irish Sports Council responsibility in this area.  I have been in contact with the council on this matter, however, because I support women's involvement in sport.  In 2005, the council established a women in sports programme and €14 million has been spent on this programme to date.  Yesterday I attended an awards ceremony for volunteers which was held at Aviva stadium.  Most of the participants were women involved in sporting organisations throughout the country.  Recently in County Mayo — I hope this will be repeated in every county — 4,500 women took part in a mini-marathon organised by the local sports partnership board and <i>The Western People</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">I am anxious to see women taking part in sports.  Earlier today I was in Croke Park to launch, along with the President, this year's ladies' camogie championship.  More than 500 clubs and 500,000 women are involved in camogie.  I want to see more women taking part in sport but while I will put pressure on the Irish Sports Council to achieve this objective, it has direct responsibility for liasing with women's groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_880">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  Under the guidelines there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">Since 2000, when the current round closed to new applicants, 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the programme, of which 46 have been completed and 12 others are at various stages.  Loughrea and New Ross have had their tender reports approved; Ballybofey-Stranorlar and Loughlinstown have had contract documents approved and are at the tender report stage; Buncrana, Castlebar, Dunmanway and De Paul, Navan Road, are preparing contract documents; and Edenderry, Clara, Ballaghadereen and Balbriggan are at preliminary report stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">A value for money and policy review report of the programme was completed and published by the Department in 2008.  The review recommended the programme should continue to be the means by which public swimming pools are provided and any new round should take account of the recommendations of the review report.  The programme is not funded by the national lottery.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">The current swimming pool programme closed in 2000.  I acknowledge the lengthy lead in time for swimming pool projects but there has been an inequitable distribution of projects nationally.  For example, two swimming pools were funded in Tralee while there is a major deficiency in my area.  The towns of Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock have the same population as Waterford city but they have no swimming pool and they have been treated inequitably.  Is it intended to reopen the programme?  I realise the State is in a precarious financial position and the programme is not a high priority, but the lack of a swimming pool is a major deficiency in communities.  The Minister of State has referred to encouraging people to participate in sports and swimming appeals across the age spectrum.  Does he foresee the programme being re-opened even on a limited basis to fill obvious gaps?</p>

            <p eId="para_884">I hope to complete the current round of projects and that is what we are doing.  Local authorities have a major problem raising the matching funds now.  The Department is reviewing the cost of the entire programme.  Local authorities are looking more at refurbishment and they have said that perhaps a scheme could be introduced in the context of energy costs.  The problem is local authorities do not have the matching funds and we are reviewing the programme.  I hope with my officials to make an announcement shortly on whether it will be reopened.</p>

            <p eId="para_890">I also refer the Deputy to my response to Priority Question No.1.  The market for air services in the European Union is fully liberalised so it is a matter for the airlines themselves to decide what routes they will serve based on their own commercial judgments.  As detailed in my response to the priority question, the Government is encouraging the airlines to deliver more tourists to Ireland and the <i>quid pro quo</i> for this will be the suspension of the travel tax if the airlines demonstrate a willingness to respond positively to this initiative.  Those discussions are continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Restoring and enhancing international access is a key priority for tourism development in 2011.  Tourism Ireland is engaging actively in co-operative marketing campaigns with air and sea carriers as well as working with Dublin Airport Authority and other airports to stimulate demand for travel to the island of Ireland from key source markets.  This year, Tourism Ireland has increased the level of resources available for co-operative marketing and for case-making with airports and relevant authorities for the restoration of lost air access or the introduction of new routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">The announcement that the air travel tax will be suspended, subject to an agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers, has been welcomed by the tourism state agencies and the tourism industry.  Until agreement has been reached with the airlines, however, it is not possible to calculate the return in tourism or spending by visitors to Ireland.</p>

The Minister for Finance factored 1 July into the jobs initiative in terms of working out the numbers and the idea was to suspend the tax from that date but that is not a certainty.  I expect to conclude discussions in the next few weeks because the airlines are deciding their timetables.  They have two seasons — winter and summer — and they are finalising their timetables now for October and deciding which routes they will service and what capacity they will provide.  The discussions will have to conclude in the next few weeks in order that they will be able to decide on routes for October.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b>
          the reason for the recent Road Safety Authority campaign highlighting risks to cyclists on the road when Dublin City Council figures have shown a marked improvement in the road safety for cyclists as well as a great increase in bike users as can be seen in the dublinbikes scheme; and the cost of said campaign.

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly</from>
            <p eId="para_902">The promotion of cycling continues to be a key element in the sustainable transport strategy being pursued by this Government.  This strategy includes investment in infrastructure designed to  enhance cycling facilities and support increased usage as well as promotional campaigns such as Bike Week.  Infrastructure projects under way include the Dublin canals cycle route and the fisheries field project in Galway.  In addition, the National Roads Authority is currently carrying out a feasibility study on a potential cycle route from Dublin to Galway.  Promotional campaigns such as the national campaign, Bike Week, have also been successful in encouraging increased cycling.  This year Bike Week will run between 18 and 26 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The content of campaigns run by the RSA is a matter for the authority.  It must be remembered that these are national campaigns which recognise the reality that cyclists can be vulnerable road users.  Between 1997 and 2010, some 178 cyclists were killed on our roads and more than 400 were seriously injured.  The campaign run by the RSA was designed to educate cyclists on how to stay safer on roads and includes important messages for drivers, who also need to pay attention and be on guard for cyclists.  To be effective the cycling strategy being pursued by the Government includes investment in the physical environment for cyclists, communication and education.  Clearly, education of both cyclists and motorists on the need to stay safe on our roads is an important element in the overall promotion strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_904">The promotion of road safety is very important.  It was felt that we had made significant progress on road safety for cyclists and that we could invest the money used for advertising more wisely in projects.  The recent statistics indicate a significant improvement in lives saved in recent years.  We would like to see an expansion of bicycle lanes to the main cities across the country and not just in Dublin.  Other cities are being neglected in comparison with the capital city.</p>

It is an objective of the Government, as stated in the programme for Government.  It is my ambition to be able to deliver on various project but that is a matter for the future.  We must assess the funding required.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The safety campaign was a good one.  The campaign cost €53,000.  It concentrated not just on cyclists but on other road users.  The campaign was very informative.  Many drivers sometimes forget about cyclists and do not factor them into their driving behaviour, particularly in urban areas where there are more cyclists on the road.  The campaign was a worthy and necessary one.  I take on board Deputy Ellis's point on the future of cycling.  It is a priority in the Department.  I hope we will be in a position to deliver on the commitments in that regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_910">Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority has statutory responsibility for the delivery of the national car test.  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements.  The testing function has been carried out since January 2010 by Applus, a global private company in compliance testing, under a contractual arrangement with the RSA.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">Responsibility for the operation and delivery of the national car test service lies solely with Applus.  The RSA exercises a supervisory role to ensure the service is provided in line with the conditions of the contract.  In order to assist the RSA in carrying out this supervisory role, the authority has appointed a contractor to carry out certain supervisory services on its behalf.  These relate to monitoring the achievement of the performance and acceptable standards by Applus, and reporting regularly to the RSA.  The service is currently provided by a consortium made up of PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Automobile Association.  The RSA continuously monitors the performance of Applus and has regular meetings with it to ensure compliance with contract requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The RSA has met with Applus and the Garda Síochána to deal with the issues and corrupt activities highlighted by the recent "Prime Time" programme and to identify the appropriate action to be taken.  I have requested the RSA to keep me fully informed of any developments on this matter.  I saw the "Prime Time" programme and was shocked by what I saw.  The first thing I did the next day was to contact the RSA to seek a report and to engage in discussions with it on the matter.  Seven vehicle inspectors who were identified as a result of the programme have been suspended and three of those seven have now been dismissed.  Action is being taken in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">The Minister has seen the "Prime Time" programme.  We were all taken aback by it and the allegations of abuse that were made about one of the main test centres, including bribery and corruption.  Cars were being passed by the centre that were not fit for the road, which is scandalous.  The Minister indicated that there has been a number of suspensions and people were dismissed.  I am pleased that the authorities acted quickly as a result of the "Prime Time" programme.</p>

It sends a terrible message to the public.  I commend the speed with which the NCT issue was addressed.  It is scandalous that such activity should happen in national car test centres because it is a crucial factor in road safety.  I accept the Road Safety Authority examines the contracts.

            <p eId="para_920">I do not see a benefit in introducing additional legislation.  What we need to do is to enforce the legislation we have in this country to a greater extent.  That is relevant to the Deputy's other point about white collar crime.  I am as frustrated as he is with the slow progress that has been achieved to date in bringing prosecutions in the banking area.  I am confident they will be brought in due course.  We will allow the DPP to construct the case that is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">From the information I have received, the contractor — Applus, has asked RTE for access to the information collected in the making of the "Prime Time" programme.  To date, RTE has not made the information available because it says it does not come within the Freedom of Information Act.  RTE has a responsibility to make the information available either to Applus or the RSA so that we have the information it has and can act accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">The Minister referred to a consortium composed of PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Automobile Association which carries out a consistency audit on equipment in the centres operated by Applus.  A much greater level of information seems to be coming from motorists who believe that it is possible to pass a test in one location and not in another, not necessarily through any corrupt practice but through a lack of consistency or uniformity in the equipment that is provided because it is not maintained to an appropriate standard.  It might be helpful if the Minister were to publish the report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Automobile Association, which I believe has been provided to the RSA.  Will the Minister indicate whether it might be possible to publish the report?</p>

            <p eId="para_924">A small number of people have been identified and appropriate action has been taken.  Does the Minister accept there has been a systems failure?  It is one thing to ask RTE to provide the information but the information provided to it was probably on the basis that individuals would not be identified because they were saying it was not just due to individuals but that there was a systems failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, spoke in the House last night about the need to have protection for people who provide information.  He outlined how he had found himself before the courts on the matter when information was provided to him in good faith.  That information was provided to RTE in good faith.  It was a very important act of public service on behalf of the people who provided it.  Is it not unfair to then expose those people in a way that they did not anticipate through the provision of the information at a later stage?  It is a systems failure, rather than a small number of rogue operators.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_293" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_926">I never liked the term "systems failure".  It is a bit of a cop out when it is used so often.  I do not see any evidence of a systems failure here.  The evidence I have seen is of people taking bribes to pass test applicants.  If there are systems issues, they relate to monitoring people while they conduct the tests.  That is being improved and CCTV cameras are being introduced in the test centres to monitor what is happening.  What happened in this case was that people took money to allow drivers cheat the testing system, but that is not a systems failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">The Deputy's point with regard to RTE is valid.  I would ask RTE to make available everything it can without compromising any commitments it made to people in terms of protecting their anonymity.  I am sure it is possible to at least make the information available, without causing repercussions for the whistleblowers.  I hope the whistleblowers understand that we are grateful they came forward and provided the information.  It is important that whistleblowers are protected and acknowledged.  I would hate to think whistleblowers in this situation would feel they might be penalised for what they did, because their action was a service to the State, the people and safety.  We need as much information as possible so we can make the system watertight.</p>

Having recently met the Kerry rural transport network representatives in my constituency and having spoken to people throughout the country, I am aware there is considerable concern about the future of the rural transport network.

I urge him to ensure he does not give consideration to the provisions of the McCarthy report, which previously sought to retract the funding provided for this transport initiative, which provides exceptionally good value for money.  The east Clare accessible transport group, which started in my area and has now broadened out to provide a service for the entire county represents exceptional value for money.  I would urge that the work under way by the previous Minister to ensure that these accessible transport initiatives are co-ordinated with Bus Éireann to assist the provision of school transport — an issue that is causing some difficulty for the Government — and the facilities and infrastructure already in place be utilised to the greatest extent possible and that appropriate funding be put in place to ensure that the initiatives continue.

            <p eId="para_938">There is no backlog of payments due from the Department to grantees.  Payments are made promptly when grantees fulfil the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">For a variety of reasons it can take grantees several years to draw down allocations.  Some of the more common reasons for this include delays in finalising the legalities required to protect the State's investment; delays in the planning process and-or construction; and difficulties in raising the required own funding.  Where delays are excessive, or the project has ceased, the Department seeks to withdraw allocations.  At 31 December 2010, there was €77.5 million in outstanding commitments to be drawn down by sports capital programme grantees.  This represents approximately 1,100 grantees and compares to €190 million in outstanding commitments at the end of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">In fairness, we do not withdraw grants from organisations, but give them every opportunity to draw them down. What happens sometimes is that we write to the organisations and they respond that they cannot withdraw the grant and wish to hand it back to the Department.  The Department gives organisations every opportunity to draw down their grants.  Over the past number of weeks we have written to organisations, because we have €77 million in outstanding grants.  We want these grants to be paid out but, if not, we want to know from the clubs whether they can draw down the funding.  If any organisation or club has been awarded a grant, we will give it any help or assistance it needs to draw down that funding.  We are anxious the grants are drawn down.  There is no delay in payment.  Once the grantees produce the legal documents, we can pay, but we want them to come up with the necessary paperwork.  These are all voluntary clubs and organisations and we want to support and help them.  We are not using the big hammer, but want to help them.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">I am very encouraged by the Minister of State's statement with regard to outstanding grants and the groups that need the funding.  There will be some groups which, unfortunately, due to planning and various other drawbacks, will be unable to draw down their funding, which will mean there will be surplus funds.  I know of groups that would be more than anxious to avail of that funding, groups that have proceeded with initiatives in their areas, whether development or sporting activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_948">I want to emphasise that when grantees come looking for that funding, the Department must find the money and that money is allocated in a budget every year.  It is not that if the money is not spent, it will be spent on another project.  That money will be just there.  When it is needed to be drawn down, it is drawn down.  It is not that money is left over and can be spent again.  We are reviewing the sports capital programme and we hope to have some news later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport and the national roads programme.  The Government has announced the preparation of a new capital investment framework for these projects for the period from 2012.  This will involve a review of all capital programmes and projects to establish a set of priorities that will contribute to economic recovery.  The results will be published as a new national development plan for the period 2012-2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The preparation of the new framework requires that my Department review all existing projects and programmes.  The review which involves consultation with relevant agencies will take account of new funding realities.  A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain existing investment and maintain high safety standards.  This of necessity will restrict the funding for new projects with only those offering the highest return having any prospect of being prioritised.  The development of phase 2 of the western rail corridor will be considered as part of the overall capital review.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The main part of the Galway outer bypass scheme was approved by An Bord Pleanála in 2008 but cannot proceed as this approval was the subject of judicial review proceedings which have culminated with a referral by the Supreme Court to the European Court of Justice of the question of the correct interpretation of Article 6(3) of the habitats directive and of Regulation 30 of the Habitats Regulations 1997.</p>

The Minister has said he will review it in the plan for 2012 to 2016.  It is vital for our tourism to put in such important rail links which that area does not have.  The Minister seems to have indicated that it will go down the road a good distance, but I urge that it be looked at very seriously as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_967">I am glad to return to the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011.  Before the adjournment, I was about to embark on the detail of the Bill.  The Bill marks the final part of the first of many steps to achieving the vision we have set ourselves for the public service and will in its own way make a positive contribution to restoring economic growth and sustainability to Government finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative basis which will allow for the formal establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and for the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I will now briefly go through the sections of the Bill and give a brief outline of their content and purpose.  Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters.  Section 1 deals with the short title, collective citation and construction.  Section 2 defines certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 defines "public service body".  Part 2 deals with the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  It transfers many of the general statutory functions of the Minister for Finance regarding the public service to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, and it puts specific public service reform and modernisation functions on a statutory basis.  Section 4 provides that the Government may determine, by order, a day to be the "appointed day" under the Act.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and the Minister for public expenditure and reform in the English language and An Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe and an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe in the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Section 6 provides that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will have responsibility for the management of gross voted expenditure and the annual Estimates process, general sanctioning powers on expenditure and policy matters relating to the appraisal, review and evaluation of expenditure, while the Minister for Finance will retain responsibility for overall budgetary parameters.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Section 7 is a further provision for the transfer of functions to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  It contains a broad provision transferring the general public service statutory functions of the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform. A number of offices currently under the aegis of the Minister for Finance will also transfer to the Minister for public expenditure and reform under this section.  These include the Commissioners of Public Works, Public Appointments Service, Commission for Public Service Appointments, Valuation Office and the State Laboratory.  A large number of remaining statutory functions which are appropriate for transfer to the Minister for public expenditure and reform will be transferred by way of transfer of functions order, which will be timed to commence immediately following the commencement of this Act.  The Schedules to the Bill list the functions which will be exercised in co-operation with the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">Section 8 details the specific public service reform and modernisation functions which are being put on a statutory basis to reflect the new reform function included in the name of the Department.  The Minister will also assume responsibility for existing non-statutory functions of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach in the area of public service modernisation, development and reform.  The statutory functions will include the formulation and development of policies required for the modernisation and development of the public service and making proposals to Government on the implementation of those policies, along with the co-ordination and review of the implementation of these measures across the public service.  The functions also include the promotion of value for money in the provision of public services and the development of policy and procedural frameworks in the procurement of goods and services by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Section 9 provides for the transfer to the Department of public expenditure and reform of the administration and business connected with the transferred functions.  Section 10 provides that if legal proceedings involving the Minister for Finance are in train in regard to a transferred function immediately before the appointed day, these proceedings will, following the appointed day, be deemed to relate to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Section 11 provides that any work commenced before the appointed day, by or under the authority of the Minister for Finance in regard to a transferred function, will be carried on and completed by the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Section 12 provides that any legal document made by the Minister for Finance in regard to a transferred function will continue to have effect as if it had been made in the first instance by the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Section 13 provides that any references to the Minister for Finance in regard to a transferred function in any legal document or in the memorandum and articles of association of any company shall be deemed to be references to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Section 14 provides that all property, rights and liabilities, moneys, stocks, shares and securities held by the Minister for Finance in regard to any transferred function will transfer to the Minister for public expenditure and reform without any further legal actions.  Section 14 also provides that the consent of the Minister for Finance will be required in regard to the disposal of assets and the application of the proceeds from the disposal of assets of State bodies, where such assets exceed a value of €50 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Part 3 deals with the performance of certain other functions including those relating to the Estimates.  Section 15 sets out the responsibility of the Minister in regard to the annual Estimates process.  This provides that the Government will approve an "annual approved expenditure amount" which can be reviewed in the course of a financial year if circumstances require.  The Minister for public expenditure and reform will have full responsibility for the management of gross voted expenditure as set out in section 6, within the annual approved expenditure amount or the revised annual approved expenditure amount.  The Minister for Finance may make recommendations to the Minister for public expenditure and reform on the apportionment of the annual, or revised annual, approved expenditure amount as between current and capital expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Section 16 provides for appropriate changes to the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 to give effect to the powers of the Minister for public expenditure and reform in regard to voted expenditure and to link the policy role of the Minister for public expenditure and reform with the payments role of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance will retain technical responsibility for payments from the Central Fund.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance will remain as Accounting Officer for both the Central Fund and the finance accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Section 17 provides that certain functions relating to the promotion and co-ordination of economic and social planning for the development of the economy and the identification of policies for general economic and social development may be exercised by either Minister separately but that they shall consult from time to time in regard to those functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">Section 18 provides that the functions transferred to the Minister for public expenditure and reform and referred to in section 7(2) and detailed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 may be performed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  These include provisions of certain Acts mainly relating to borrowings by State agencies.  Section 18 also provides that the functions referred to in section 7(3) and detailed in Part 2 of Schedule 2 may be performed only following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  These relate mainly to the review mechanism in the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Section 19 ensures that responsibility for matters relating to superannuation, remuneration etc., of bodies under the aegis of the Minister for Finance remains with the Minister.  The Minister for Finance will perform these functions following consultation with the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Part 4 provides for the necessary amendments to miscellaneous legislation to take account of the establishment of the new Department or to link the policy role of the Minister for public expenditure and reform in regard to the legislation with the payments role of the Minister for Finance in regard to the Central Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Section 20 provides for the amendment of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act 1924 to take account of the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_1002">I ask the House to support and approve this Bill and, in doing so, provide a sound legislative basis to underpin the formal establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  This is so I can in my own right perform the duties I have been performing in a general way through the authority vested legally in the Minister for Finance and so I can be accountable fully to this House.  This Bill is an important step on our reform journey and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I have a number of comments thereon.  Before I refer to the notes I have prepared on the Bill, I want to comment on specific aspects of what the Minister said.  In his first sentence, he referred to the creation of a revitalised and customer-focused public service.  He stated twice more in the first page of his speech that he wanted a customer-focused public service.  He insulted all the public servants in the country three times in the first page of his first speech by telling them they are not focusing on their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">We all know someone can improve but for the Minister to come into this House and use that phrase three times is as much as to say public servants have not been concerned about the people they are serving, whether it is a local authority or the Department of Social Protection.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">——I am saying he is attacking the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">I want to highlight some points in the Minister's script.  I understand from where the people in the Department of Finance, who wrote this script, are coming.  They use the phrase that we must all make better use our resources and draw more effectively on the potential that exists for improving and sharing public information.  That is a worthwhile objective with which many of us agree but as the Minister is aware, public information can only be shared between public bodies if the Data Protection Act is amended substantially.  The Minister is aware that housing officers do not have access to social welfare records, and the Health Service Executive does not share records for means tests with local authorities, whether it is for education grants or whatever.  While there needs to be improvement in that area, the Minister can only do that with a significant change to the Data Protection Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The Minister stated also that there is an acceptance that we cannot afford the same level of services and that there will be further cuts.  The Minister might explain before the legislation is passed where the cuts to which he is referring will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Minister went on to refer to the Croke Park agreement and stated the framework for how this challenging agenda can be delivered on is provided by it.  I am delighted to see the Minister has been converted to the Croke Park agreement.  When that agreement was being negotiated at length involving the public service, the staff representatives and the Government his colleagues in the Labour Party were mute on the issue.  I am delighted to see the Minister's full conversion to what was a skilfully negotiated agreement.  As he stated in his contribution, it is clear the agreement can serve as an effective enabler of economic recovery.  We have been saying that for the past 12 months but the Minister never accepted it but now that the Department of Finance officials are writing his script I am delighted to see he is accepting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">The Minister stated also that the report being produced by P. J. Fitzpatrick will be considered by the Government and published shortly.  I welcome that.  The Minister might confirm when concluding the debate — I do not believe it is mentioned in his script — that the report will be discussed in the Dáil.  Will we get the report in the Dáil as published or will the Minister do a "Minister Bruton" on it in that he will receive it and then give his own version of it which will have a different perspective?  I would like to get the report directly as published rather than the Department's interpretation of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The Minister went on to refer to the question of numbers in the public service.  Everything I am saying are direct quotes from the Minister's script.  He acknowledged that 16,400 people have left the service since the end of 2008, that between 18,000 and 21,000 will leave by 2014, with a further 4,000 leaving by 2015.  That is 41,400 public servants the Minister says will leave the public service as a result of this measure.  That is an exceptionally high figure.  I recall during the election campaign both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party had agreed that the combined total of people due to leave the public service from the start of this process would be in the order of 28,000.  Now that Labour has signed up to the Fine Gael policy we are hearing a figure of 41,000.  The Minister might provide some clarity on that because I felt the Minister's approach during the election campaign in terms of 28,000 was reasonable as it was approximately 10% of public servants but if the figure is increasing to over 40,000 out of the 300,000 he is pushing up the number of people who will be leaving the service and those who have already left the service.  I am disappointed that the numbers are increasing to that extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The Minister also acknowledged that we had tremendous growth in the economy last year, and I appreciate his comments regarding the way the economy was managed last year on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">In the final paragraph before the conclusion the Minister states there will be amendments to the Bill to deal mainly with the policy role of the Minister for public expenditure and reform and with the payment role of the Minister for Finance in regard to certain functions.  It is clear now we have two Ministers with a finger in the pie on an issue.  Every Deputy in this House is aware that if one goes to a local authority or the National Roads Authority, NRA, about a particular job it is doing it will say it came from the Department.  We are now talking about enlarging the circle where blame can be shifted in the public service in that if there is a problem with the NRA it will blame the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department of Finance which decided on the allocation will blame the new Department of public expenditure and reform for setting the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">In terms of getting something done through any of the State bodies, the circle is getting larger, there is less accountability and responsibility is being diffused.  The Department of Finance will write the cheque, the Department of public expenditure will set the policy, the line Department will have a direct hands-on approach and then the relevant State body in the Department such as the NRA or some other body will do the implementation.  That is a recipe to ensure that everybody is accountable but nobody is accountable.  I would like that matter to be reassessed because the emphasis in the Bill is on improved co-ordination and efficiency.  The Minister is adding a new layer of bureaucracy.  He is adamant in his speech that there will now be a separate role for him regarding policy and that the payment will come from the Department of Finance.  In that regard I have explained the way the circle is getting bigger with responsibility being diffused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The most significant parts of the Bill are the Schedules on pages 19 to 23 which beg the question what power the new Minister will have.  I would like to believe he will have significant power.  The Minister's script refers to every section, very thoroughly in regard to Part 4, but the Minister referred to the Schedules in a skimpy manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">There is a large table in Schedule 2, Part 1, which is headed, "Functions performable [by the Minister] with consent of Minister for Finance".  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will have no ability to perform those functions, if he chooses, unless he does it with the express written consent of the Minister for Finance.  There are dozens of functions listed including the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, the Broadcasting Act 2009, the Charities Act 2009, the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006 and the Road Safety Authority Act 2006.  The list covers three pages, all of which are functions the Minister will not be able to perform unless he receives the consent of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Schedule 3 deals with functions the Minister for Finance will retain.  It states the Minister for Finance can exercise these powers at the request of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  In other words, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, might want to do the job but he must ask the Minister for Finance to do it.  It covers the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act 1999, the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938 and other issues such as that.  There is another full page of those which again the Minister has no authority to implement if he believes it is necessary.  All he can do is ask the Minister for Finance to do it and that raises the question: in regard to what legislation does the Minister, Deputy Howlin, have power he can exercise?</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">There are three items of legislation in Part 2 of Schedule 2.  They are section 10 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, section 7 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, and section 13 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  There are three sections of three different Acts for which the Minister will have "Functions performable [by the Minister, Deputy Howlin] after consultation with Minister for Finance".  Regarding three small sections of three Acts out of a list of over 100 Acts listed in all the Schedules, the ones he can perform can only be done after he has consulted with the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance seems to have won that battle in recent months and it has neutered this Department before it even gets off the ground.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1026">The explanatory memorandum states: "Section 6 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have responsibility for the management of gross voted expenditure and the annual estimates process".  The gross voted expenditure for this year, according to Government Estimates, is €57 billion.  The net Estimate for the Government for this year is €46 billion and the difference is €11 billion, which is income that has been received.  The Minister is in an invidious position.  He will be theoretically responsible for €57 billion, but we have seen how the Department has already put caveats on his powers in most areas.  Of that €57 billion, a total of €11 billion is income that will be generated through appropriations-in-aid, payments to central funds and so on.  The legislation on this is very clear.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will have no authority or even ability to open his mouth about raising funds and raising charges.  He will be responsible for total expenditure in the Department, but will have no authority over the funds raised for the Department.  For example, the Minister will be responsible for managing the Estimate for the Department of Education and Skills, but he will have no role under this Bill to set the allocation of ESF funding, determining third level fees, or the cost of school transport.  That will be a job for the line Minister.  He will also be responsible for the health Estimate but will have no right or authority to set accident and emergency fees, hospital and prescription charges.  That income will come into the Department and will be part of the gross expenditure for which he will be responsible, but he will have no authority in setting it.  How can somebody be in charge of something when he has no legal right to be involved in raising €11 billion of it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The Bill also makes clear that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has no right on deciding between capital and current expenditure.  That job will be retained by the Minister for Finance.  When he is examining his allocation to the various local authorities, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will have no hand, act or part in setting the new household charge.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will want to do that.  He will want to set the new water rates as well as refuse charges and the second home tax because the main Department for these charges is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Deputy Howlin will have no say over these charges, even in respect of council rents, yet he is responsible under this Bill for the management of total expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">This is a major inconsistency.  It was dreamt up to put a Government together.  It was not in the Fine Gael manifesto and it was not mentioned during the discussions until a row broke out on who would be Minister for Finance.  The leaders of the coalition parties obviously decided that both sides should be kept happy, but now we have a situation where the two party leaders, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for public expenditure and reform will be assuming responsibility for all key decisions.  When they get to Cabinet, decisions will have been agreed by the party leaders and the senior finance people in both parties.  This will dilute the real contribution of the Cabinet to those particular discussions as things will be decided outside the Cabinet by these four people.  This also reduces the power of the Minister for Finance.  I have never seen something formalised to such an extent that the two party leaders are involved in a committee of four that is chaired by the Tánaiste.  We are weakening the role of the Department of Finance.  We are setting up a new Department with very limited powers and this must be taken into consideration during debate on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The Minister will also assume responsibility for the non-statutory functions of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach, so we are giving him legal power for something that does not need legal power in the first place.  They are non-statutory powers and now we are creating a new restriction on something that is working at the moment.  We are providing him with statutory powers for something that does not require such powers.  It is a kind of made up Department to keep the Labour Party happy.  People are happy to be in the Government and have chauffeur-driven State cars for colleagues in the Minister of State's constituency——</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">I thank Deputy Fleming for agreeing to share time.  I am pleased to have the opportunity of making a contribution to the debate.  At the heart of this Bill is the politics of forming a coalition.  It is clear the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party reached a pragmatic compromise when it came to allocating Cabinet portfolios.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I would like to start on a positive note.  I welcome aspects of this Bill.  Setting up a Department to deal exclusively with the public service and which is charged with responsibility of driving through public sector reform is a positive development.  Having one Minister and one Department in charge of that area will bring greater cohesion and co-ordination to the efforts to secure public sector reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">In his opening remarks, the Minister for public expenditure and reform painted a sobering picture on the future of the public sector over the next few years.  He highlighted that the cost of delivering public services must be reduced further, with fewer staff and tighter budgets, and that it must become better integrated and more customer focused, as well as being leaner and more efficient.  That is a reality that we all acknowledge in this House.  There will be difficult days ahead for the public service as we seek to get a better return for the investment that the State is making in our public services.  As public representatives, we all have extensive experience of dealing with a wide range of public bodies and the different arms of the public service.  I acknowledge that there is room for improvement.  There are thousands of outstanding public servants working in this country who provide an excellent service to the general public, and to us as public representatives, but there are aspects of the system that are not working well enough.  For example, it is not acceptable for us to write to public bodies and not even get an acknowledgment.  Even if one receives an acknowledgment, there often can be no further response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">The issue is about using more efficiently the resources being put into the public service, working with the social partners, and bringing about improvements that will result in better public services.  That is an enormous challenge and in the EU-IMF deal, there is a strict deadline for the achievement of the savings set out under the Croke Park deal.  Those savings have to be achieved by the end of September and if that does not happen, the agreement is clear that compensatory adjustments will have to be made in the public sector pay bill.  The truth is that it is in the interests of public sector unions, the Government and everybody involved in the process to ensure the Croke Park deal delivers on the improvements we are seeking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Deputy Fleming highlighted the number of public servants who are going to lose their jobs, be it voluntarily or otherwise, over the next few years.  This number is between 22,000 and 25,000, in addition to those who have already ended their employment in the public sector.  That is a very significant number.  We negotiated a complex agreement last year with the Croke Park deal.  I welcome the late conversion of the Labour Party to that deal and its leadership is now highlighting it as the mechanism for achieving what needs to be achieved in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The key issue for me is about efficiency, value for money and accountability.  I had the privilege during the previous Dáil of serving on the Committee of Public Accounts, and we saw examples every week of public money not being spent wisely or appropriately.  One of the most frustrating aspects of that was that there were no consequences for anyone.  People were coming in and giving statements that were not satisfactory.  We were not happy with the answers, but there was no outcome to it.  We issued our report and that is where the matter ended.  In the Minister's new brief of public sector reform, the issue of accountability, not just at political level but also at senior management level across the public service, must be to the fore.  At a time when resources are tighter than they have been previously, we need to ensure that every cent spent is spent wisely and that proper procedures are being employed.  There must be consequences for failure to adhere to the policies that are set down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The Government missed an opportunity by not opening the position of Secretary General in this new Department — and, in future, in the Department of Finance — to persons from outside the civil and public service.  People should at least have been given the opportunity to apply and be considered for those posts.  Much has been made of the intention to open up the public sector to people with expertise from the private sector, yet the opportunity to be head of a Department that is charged with the responsibility of public sector reform is closed off completely to those who have expertise in transforming organisations and leading organisational change in the private sector.  They are not even being given the opportunity to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Apart from the transfer of control of the public service and public sector reform to this new Department, some other aspects of the Bill, dealing with the transfer of functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, are bizarre.  They are a recipe for confusion, an increase in officialdom and a deterioration in accountability to the House and, through that forum, to the public.  It is clear from reading the Bill and the explanatory memorandum that it is game, set and match to the Department of Finance.  Any devolution of power to the new Minister for public expenditure and reform is heavily qualified and in many cases is conditional on the explicit consent of the Minister for Finance, in this case Deputy Noonan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">It is certain that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will play a subservient role to the Minister for Finance.  At a time when we are trying to simplify procedures in the public service and make it more transparent and accountable, we are putting in place a system that is the antithesis of that.  It does not provide the clarity about roles that should be available at first glance.  It is essential that the Minister publish a timeline and clear details of the budgetary process that will be implemented in 2011 and 2012 if this Bill is adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I will give some examples of what I am referring to.  Sections 7(2) and (3) state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1044">(2) The functions conferred on the Minister for Finance by or under any of the provisions specified in <i>Part 1</i> of <i>Schedule 2</i> are transferred to the Minister [for public expenditure and reform].</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1045">(3) The functions conferred on the Minister for Finance by or under any of the provisions specified in <i>Part 2</i> of <i>Schedule 2</i> are transferred to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">That all sounds fine.  However, section 18 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1047">(1) The Minister shall not perform a function transferred by <i>subsection (2)</i> of <i>section 7</i> without the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1048">(2) The Minister shall not perform a function transferred by <i>subsection (3)</i> of <i>section 7</i> without first consulting the Minister for Finance in relation thereto.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">When one looks at Schedule 2 one can see in Part 1 a list of 78 Acts with regard to which the new Minister can act only with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and in Part 2 a further three with regard to which he can only act having consulted with the Minister for Finance.  How will that work in practice?  Every time the Minister proposes to perform a function regarding one of these 81 Acts, will an official from his Department need to write to an official from Deputy Noonan's Department across the corridor seeking explicit consent for the Minister to execute it?  It seems to be a recipe for inertia and confusion.  A whole range of the apparent powers being given to the new Minister are subject to such consent or to consultation.  While on the face of it he may appear to have immense powers, when one probes the detail one sees that there are so many caveats that his real power lies only in the area of managing and transforming the public service through the reform agenda — powers that he certainly does have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The Oireachtas Library and Research Service highlighted some of the effects of this Bill.  For example, one of the 78 Bills referred to in Schedule 2 is the Inland Fisheries Act 2010.  Given what is proposed in this Bill, section 43 of that Act should now read: "IFI may, for the purposes of the performance of its functions, borrow money but shall not do so without the consent of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance".  It is farcical that this is what the legislation will have to say.  The body can only borrow money with the consent of the Minister, who has the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Why can the Minister for Finance not give that consent directly, as he currently does?  I do not know, but it strikes me as an odd way to structure the business of the public service in these two new Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">There is a need to clarify how the annual budgetary process will work under this legislation.  Who will be responsible for what, and when will that happen?  Reading the research notes attached to the Bill, it is very unclear.  We need more details of what the proposed legislation means in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The Minister's opening speech on Second Stage mostly dealt with reform of the public service and the general economic environment.  The latter was a regurgitation of the explanatory memorandum published by the Bills Office.  What we need to hear are clear, concrete examples of what this Bill means in practice, particularly who is going to do what and who will be responsible and accountable for what functions.  For example, when the Exchequer returns for May are published in the next few days, will we have a statement from the Minister for public expenditure and reform on the expenditure side and a statement from the Minister for Finance on the revenue side?  The Minister for Finance will remain responsible for the overall budgetary framework.  Is he the only person who will be commenting on the Exchequer returns, or will both Ministers deal with different aspects?</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The Bill makes clear that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will be responsible for gross voted expenditure but, as Deputy Fleming pointed out, the difference between gross and net is significant.  We need clarification on whether Deputy Howlin will be accountable, for example, for appropriations-in-aid, because if he is not, we will have a situation in which expenditure on passport services will fall within his remit but the fees will not; gross expenditure on school transport will be his responsibility but the fees, again, will not; and the cost of Met Éireann will be a matter for the Minister but the fees it charges will not.  These are some examples of the possible confusion arising from the adoption of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">I welcome the setting up of a Department to deal exclusively with public sector reform.  That is necessary and can be supported.  However, the transfer of functions between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for public expenditure and reform set out in this Act is so cumbersome and confusing that it will result in less accountability and less efficiency in administration of both Departments, leading to greater difficulties than would otherwise have been envisaged.  I hope we will receive some more significant answers in the closing remarks of the Minister on Second Stage and when dealing with the meat of the sections on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_1055">Like other Deputies, I am pleased to speak in this debate.  I must state it took a while and I am much relieved that the Bill is now before the House.  I want to start by going back to basics, as they say, by reminding the House that the ultimate measure of any reform agenda in the public sector will be the experience of citizens seeking and accessing services.  This will be the final jury as to the success or otherwise of reform in this area.  There will be much debate in the House in the coming months and years about outputs and outcomes, expenditure frameworks and ceilings, and performance budgeting.  We all know an agenda of modernisation and reform is significant and that it cannot be delivered overnight.  There are no quick fixes.  In the past, mistakes have been made.  Half-hearted attempts at reform have failed.  Often, public policy was shaped around self-interest and sometimes electoral gain.  Civil Service pay grades for those at the very top have skyrocketed while pay at the bottom has nose-dived and, as we speak, 10% of those families in receipt of family income supplement are civil and public service workers.  This pay gap is unlikely to change under the current administration since the Government has committed to basic salaries of up to €200,000 for top civil servants, including the Taoiseach and his Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">A two-tier health system has been nurtured and actively encouraged, not by accident but by design.  Many children are taught in damp and grotty prefabs.  Those with special needs and their families have been utterly failed by the State.  Carers are left to cope alone.  All of this happened on the watch of Celtic tiger Ireland.  We know now that the legacy of the "boom" as it was called was an increase in inequality.  Unless this endemic and fundamental inequality in public service provision is removed, the Minister's commitment to reform is meaningless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">The Minister has promised to be more focussed on citizens.  To be more focussed is not good enough.  The people must be front and centre in the reform process.  The public sector exists for one reason and one reason only, and this is to serve the public good.  If the Government is to serve the public good, it must prioritise investment in services, in the good times and the bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Investment in public services is not something this or previous Governments have embraced.  The OECD report of 2008, Towards an Integrated Public Service, notes that despite an increase in the number of public sector employees between 1995 and 2007 — and we must bear in mind that we were starting from a very low base relative to other OECD countries — Government spending and employment growth in the sector failed to keep pace with population and GDP growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">As recently as 2005, Ireland still had the third lowest public expenditure rate as a percentage of GDP in the OECD, ahead of only Korea and Mexico.  This is the record of the State on public services.  Despite this, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, boasted earlier this month and again today in the House, that the "Government is making steady progress on reducing numbers employed in the public service.  The number of posts has been reduced by 2,000 in the three months to end March 2011" and that "public service numbers have fallen by 16,400 since 2008", in case any of us had forgotten that fact.  In celebrating this, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, finds himself in the dubious company of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and the like, who actively seek and celebrate increased unemployment during a recessionary period.  This is a perverse position to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Public services are a real yardstick by which we measure our society's success.  Equality in service provision illustrates how equal  society is.  In the boom times society became deeply unequal in most areas of public service provision.  Undoubtedly, radical reform is needed but the reform agenda must not be used or abused to widen the chasm in society, run down services, hand over critical services such as health to the private sector or create an even greater level of unemployment across society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">To reform is to improve the experience for citizens,from the cradle to the grave, when accessing public services.  The purpose of reform is to abolish bad practice and mismanagement.  It is to change for the better how we do our business, keeping the citizen's well-being and rights at the centre of every decision we make.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The buck must stop with Ministers.  The people want and deserve accountability.  Disappointingly, there is no evidence of such commitment from the Government, quite the opposite.  Recently, I asked the Minister for Finance how the Government intends to adequately deliver services to citizens while at the same time reducing public sector numbers.  The Minister's response was interesting and instructive.  He responded that it is a matter for local management to address service delivery issues with reduced numbers.  This is not a case of joined-up thinking or accountability on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">It is interesting to chart the journey of the Bill.  The Labour Party's general election manifesto promised to establish for a limited time an office of public sector reform.  As we know, reforming the public sector is not a one-off event, it is an ongoing commitment to excellence, as it must be.  The Labour Party stated it wanted fewer management layers in the civil and public service, and more freedom for managers to manage staff and budgets, which is quite a challenge when staff and budgets are facing at least €3 billion worth of cuts every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The Labour Party further promised more modern management and staffing structures; more user-centred services delivery; to drive reform planning and implement the change agenda with performance indicators identified to allow progress on high level priorities to be monitored; more accountability; transparency; multi-annual departmental budgets; and a citizen-centred approach to public service reform.  In other words, motherhood and apple pie.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">By contrast, Fine Gael, the party of small government, promised a 10% cut in public sector numbers and an increase in workload for frontline staff, who are to take up the additional slack of those fired by Fine Gael over the coming years.  It wants to do this while retaining the recruitment embargo.  An office to be responsible for public spending and modernisation was detailed but with no reform <i>per se</i>, just a slash and burn approach to public service numbers and spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">Both parties, which now form the Government, promised upskilling and retraining throughout the Civil Service in human resources, finance, economics, corporate services and information technology.  What we got in the programme for Government public sector reform commitments was a hotchpotch of rationalisation and a mishmash of modernisation measures, with a promise to empower civil servants.  Then there is the recently renegotiated EU-IMF programme, which makes a reduction of public sector numbers and public sector spending a condition of support.  The bailout agreed to by the Government fundamentally shapes and undermines any serious attempt at public sector reform.  This is if one understands reform to be about quality and universal service provision.  It is in this context that we look at the structures and staffing of this new Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The new Minister will be responsible for managing public expenditure in the overall envelope set by the Government but he is not responsible for the budgetary parameters as the Minister for Finance has retained these responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The new Department of public expenditure and reform is housed in the Department of Finance.  Two thirds of the new Department's staff come from the Department of Finance — in fact, many will not even have to move desks as the Department of Finance divisions in which they worked are to remain intact within the Department of public expenditure and reform.  The recently appointed Secretary General to the Department of public expenditure and reform first began working for the Department of Finance in 1993, despite the Minister's commitment last month to attract external candidates to top jobs such as this to create a fair and competitive process designed to find the best person for the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">In light of all of this, the following question must be asked.  In real terms, how new is this new Department?  This Bill details a transfer of statutory functions from the Department of Finance to the Department of public expenditure and reform but ultimately there is nothing really new in its role, bar perhaps the Department's name.  It is also worth noting that the only division being transferred to the Minister which broadly addresses real reform comes from the Department of the Taoiseach, namely, the public service modernisation division.  However, it is not specifically mentioned in the Bill nor is its function being made statutory.  Within the three divisions, there are worthy and important functions but surely if this Department is to be truly new and steeped in a reform agenda, reshaping its structure and autonomy will be key it its success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Recent outreach efforts by the Department of public expenditure and reform are welcome.  Involving academics, other heads of Departments and various relevant stakeholders in the process of reform is a positive move.  However, the most obvious concern is that since the new Department is being led by old hands within old structures, then old habits will win out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">If the Department of Finance could not let go of its management and control of expenditure, which is now clear, then the Government had two clear options — to exclude expenditure from the new Department or instead move a restructured Department to an alternative site.  As neither option was chosen, the Minister's decisions will always be undermined by the fact that he remains under the thumb of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Department of Finance mandarins.  Perhaps this arrangement and division of the Department of Finance smoothed the passage to forming a coalition government.  However, there is a very real possibility that the incoherence and inertia that may arise from the confusion and overlapping roles will be a heavy cost in terms of any supposed reform agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The Minister said now is an opportune time for the Government to engage in a new process of change.  He acknowledged that many of the State's systems and processes are in need of radical reform.  The Minister believes cutting numbers is key but so too is the citizen.  A number of reviews are under way, including the comprehensive spending review, the capital spending review and the departmental review of the McCarthy report on the sale of State assets as well as the Croke Park agreement.  We are told the public service will be more dynamic, integrated, transparent and customer-focused and that the traditional values of integrity, impartiality, diligence and commitment, which are all alive and well in the public service, will be built on.  The Minister intends to foster a culture of openness, transparency and accountability, but again the real measure of his success will be the experience of the citizen accessing a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">If all these reforms are to be achieved, the Government needs to walk away from its rationalisation model — its commitment to cutbacks.  This model has already fundamentally undermined service provision.  Current reductions in public service numbers have arisen primarily from a natural fall-off, or "wastage" — a word I do not like — which, in itself, is a natural process and one that does not ordinarily undermine a system provided the lost experience and skills are replaced and replenished, but this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The Government's absolute refusal to lift the embargo means that experienced and fully skilled psychiatric nurses and gardaí — to give two examples — are not being replaced.  This, coupled with increased demand on services as a result of this and the previous Government's commitment to stifling growth, is creating deeper inequities within the system and in wider society.  This Government is falling at the very first hurdle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Addressing the front line personnel deficit will deliver immediate benefits not only to our people, but critically to the economy.  Austerity has failed spectacularly.  Growth is down, unemployment is up and the public purse simply cannot shell out endlessly for private banking debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Implementing a full programme of modernisation across the public sector will take a number of years.  Cross skill training across departmental management is vital but again it will take a number of years before we see the full benefits of this.  Updating and integrating technology and online services again is key but it will take time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Root and branch reform of the culture and systems within the Civil Service and public service which has led, in some instances, to outlandish wages, no accountability and bad practice among the highest paid requires a deep transformation.  Changing the top-down culture from one that sees its role as one that serves the political class to one that serves the citizen can be achieved but even if the Government was committed to such a programme, this too would take time and we know time is not on its side.  Unless Fine Gael and the Labour Party embark on a real programme of reform and modernisation across the public sector while critically bolstering front line services, this new Department, like the Government and the one before it, will have failed the people spectacularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">In moving this Bill, the Minister reminded us of the harsh economic climate that exists.  He signalled that productivity and value for money must be at the heart of public sector reform.  He is absolutely right and I support his position on that.  However, resourcing front line services must also be a foundation stone of real public sector reform.  The Minister is in a state of denial or delusion or perhaps both when he claims that public services have been largely unaffected by the cutbacks, or budgetary consolidation to use the polite term, pursued by the last Government and continued by the current Administration.  The Minister's assertion that we cannot afford current levels of services will send a shiver down the back of every person who has been short-changed by the current overstretched and under-resourced services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Let me end as I began: the ultimate measure of any reform agenda within the public sector will be the experience of citizens seeking and accessing services.  The people will be the jury and they will decide ultimately the success or failure of this enterprise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">That is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">My immediate reaction to this Bill is one of approval because it is important that the idea of public expenditure is taken in isolation and addressed.  Whatever the ideological view people take on public expenditure, there is undoubtedly a problem and a need to readdress those difficulties, which have been the cause of our deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">The Minister, Deputy Howlin's, speech was very strong on aspirations and very low on reality.  It was peppered with the jargon I recognise from a lengthy period of dealing with the Department of Finance.  It is rather odd that the person who has been asked to come in here has had the contents of his speech so greatly influenced by the problem he ought to be addressing.  By that I mean that the Department of Finance has obviously had a huge influence on the break-up of the Department as proposed in the Bill.  This is a clear conflict of interest, a difficulty which has not been overcome in the Bill but is obvious within it, and the Department of Finance, one of the great problems of public expenditure, is the victor in the battle between the old Department and the new.  As other speakers have said, it is clear from the powers given to the new Ministry that the Department of Finance, on the whole and in general, retains a great deal of its old powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">It is the Department of Finance, after all, which presided over the excesses in public expenditure we have witnessed for many years, particularly under the last Government.  While the aspirations are there, the reality is that the Minister's speech is disappointing.  There is a lot of familiar old hat in it, but history suggests there is not a great deal of hope that those aspirations will become reality.  I say this as one who has done a good deal of work in looking at what has happened to public expenditure in recent years and at the extraordinary waste of public money that was tolerated in particular by the Department which is entrusted with seeing that public money is not wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">One of the great problems is not addressed in the Bill, nor in the Minister's speech, namely, that it is not just the Department of Finance itself but the model of social partnership to which we have clung for so long that is at the root of our difficulties.  Social partnership, so fashionable for so long in this and the other House and among all political parties, bears a heavy responsibility for the mess in which we find ourselves and for the current budget deficit.  There is absolutely no doubt that the runaway wages we saw in the period of the first benchmarking deal were a result of the social partnership model which virtually everybody worshipped for so long.  There we saw a once-off deal which gave public servants an increase of 8.9% regardless of performance, although it was in theory tied to performance.  History suggests that our aspirations to cut public expenditure, or to ask the public service unions to pull back their demands, will not be successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">That benchmarking deal was won as a direct result of social partnership and of the social partners seizing power in this land over those who were democratically elected in this House.  The deals were not ratified by this House but rather bypassed the House.  The deals were excessive and we are now, partly through the Croke Park agreement but in other areas as well, trying to row back on them in rather obscure ways.  There is no recognition in the Minister's speech that the social partnership model has failed.  What happened under that model is still happening — to a lesser extent, perhaps, but it is still happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Successive social partnership deals were agreed from 1987 to 2010-11, but they did not begin as they ended.  They began in 1987 with the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, agreeing a deal that was flagged between him and the unions.  However, they developed into something much more sinister and dangerous.  They developed into a programme for Government which interfered in the democratic rights of this House.  The social partners became the Patricians in this nation, deciding on policies way outside pay deals.  They decided on policies on foreign aid, policies to do with the Irish language — all of this was in social partnership deals of various sorts.  Some of these agreements ran to 120 pages.  The result was that the social partners got too powerful and started spending other people's money, that is, taxpayers' money, and this House ratified that public expenditure on the direction of the Government which negotiated the deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">It is my view that the main culprit in social partnership was not the trade unions but IBEC.  The unions did what they have always done and which it is their job to do, namely, to negotiate the best possible pay deal for their members.  Unfortunately, they negotiated more than that because the employers were a busted flush who capitulated at the last minute on every pay deal, particularly those relating to public service pay.  As a result the model appeared to flourish by ensuring industrial peace.  It delivered industrial peace but at a cost the Exchequer could never have afforded and for which we are paying now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">After the Oireachtas was bypassed in this way the social partnership monster got bigger and bigger and a whole partnership industry developed which involved an enormous amount of public expenditure.  Social partnership quangos developed in the form of all types of semi-State bodies.  Trade union leaders were then appointed to the boards of these quangos and rewarded.  Rights commissioners were appointed and given jobs at €470 a day in order to keep this particular engine on the road.  At the same time the nation was spending money it could not afford in the grip of a social partnership model which is now discredited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">I would have liked to hear the Minister say more in his speech about the Croke Park deal.  Nobody knows the status of that deal and whether the trade unions are in fact delivering on modernisation.  Nobody could blame them for not delivering on modernisation because they have never been expected to do so.  Every single time they have eyeballed the Government on this issue, the Government has rolled over and the unions have won.  This legacy of social partnership is one of the reasons public expenditure is so high in this country.  It would be more honest had the Minister said that the model has failed, that the Croke Park agreement is a legacy of that model and that we will now be moving in a different direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">Instead he pussyfoots around with aspirations of reform but very little delivery.  Why does he think we have seen such problems in bodies like FÁS, CIE and the HSE?  Does he not recognise that FÁS was a problem structurally as well as being subject to inefficiencies, neglect, negligence and a great degree of malpractice both at board level and in its training programmes?  Unfortunately, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has indicated that my time is up.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1092">The new Department would be better titled the Ministry for cuts, slashing jobs and smashing our public services to pay off the bankers' gambling debts on orders from the EU-IMF.  That is a longer title but a more accurate one.  We all want to see reform.  Reform is a beautiful word.  Who could not want reform?  Ordinary people are crying out for reform of public services.  However, what they mean by reform is that they want better public services.  They want more teachers in our schools so that pupil-staff ratios improve rather than get worse, as is currently the case.  They want more special needs assistants and resource hours for the most vulnerable children in our education system.  What they get is cuts and caps in those vital resources.  Every community is crying out for more public service workers to fix the broken roads, the cracked paths and to get rid of the graffiti plastered all over the walls of estates.  They want proper maintenance of estates and parklands but they cannot get it because there are not enough people employed in the public service to do these jobs.  We need more public servants employed as community workers in vulnerable communities, where young children have nothing, no support, and desperately need such workers to help them get a decent start in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">We need more public sector workers in our health service.  We need more nurses in order to open the thousands of hospital beds that are empty because we do not have enough nurses and health workers to provide desperately needed health services, to deal with waiting lists and with those sitting on trolleys for days due to lack of investment in staff and facilities in our health service.  We need to deal with the myth, the lie and the spin that the problem in the economy and our society is the public service and that the answer to society's problem is to butcher the public service, as this Ministry will set out to do at the behest of the EU-IMF.  In public debate and the vilification of the public sector deployed over the past number of years since the economic crisis started, it never gets out that we spend less, as a proportion of GDP, on every single area of public service compared to our European counterparts.  As a proportion of GDP we spend less than our European counterparts on health, education and other public services.  We do not have too much public service, we have too little public service.  We have fewer people employed in the public service than most of our European counterparts.  Our public services are in a desperate crisis as a result of that, which is inflicting real suffering on the elderly, the sick, the vulnerable, the disabled and the young.  It is shocking.  This Ministry is a special Ministry set up to make a bad situation worse, to slash and carve our public services and to make more people unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">That is not to say we do not need genuine public service reform.  We certainly do need it but let us start with politicians' salaries.  It is outrageous that the Taoiseach pays himself eight or nine times what the average worker earns.  It is outrageous that Ministers are on €140,000 or €150,000 a year when people on social welfare have to live on less than €200 a week.  It is outrageous that this is being cut and other charges are being imposed.  If we want public sector reform, let us start with slashing the salaries of politicians and Ministers.  Let them see the pay cuts.  Let us start slashing the salaries of top civil servants, the Secretaries General who earn €200,000 or €150,000.  What about the public servants in the banking sector?  Some are still being paid more than the cap of €500,000 for bankers who helped to wreck our economy.  It is obscene.  How can we justify paying bankers who wrecked this economy with public money and paying them 20 or 30 times what the average worker earns?  It is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">Deputy Ross referred to the waste of money in the public service and he is correct.  However, the problem is that most of the money is wasted because the work done by local authorities and Departments was outsourced to the private sector.  Massive overruns were not because of public servants.  Previously, much of the vital infrastructure projects and public housing was built by directly employed public servants.  There was no profit margin creamed off by cowboy builders and cowboy contractors.  The waste in public spending resulted from the outsourcing of this to the mates of people working at the top in the public sector.  They creamed it when they were working in the private sector.  Private developers ripped off the public with massive overruns.  The answer is not more privatisation and more cuts in public services but for the people now rotting on the dole, including skilled construction workers and teachers, to be employed in the public service to provide vital infrastructure.  This can take the profit motive out of the equation.  The profit motive was a corrosive cancer at the heart of the public sector.  Why have we seen the obscene high salaries at the top of the public service?  It is precisely because the people at the top of the public service benchmarked themselves against the bankers and multimillionaires in the private sector.  If the CEO with whom the public sector worker was negotiating earned €500,000 or €750,000, the public sector worker believed he should earn at least €250,000 or €500,000.  That is where the obscenity started.  The EU-IMF deal and this new Ministry is about accelerating the problem that caused the crisis.  We need to move in precisely the opposite direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">A typical example from my area indicates the lack of willingness of this Government to listen to serious proposals for saving public money.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council passed a capital budget to build a new super library headquarters on a public space for €35 million.  The council is controlled by Labour and Fine Gael and they passed the budget.  We all like to see investment in libraries but no one asked for this library headquarters.  People have asked for investment in public swimming baths but no money was allocated to that.  Instead, they built a library headquarters because Labour and Fine Gael wanted a trophy project in Dún Laoghaire.  Today, I pointed out that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was supposed to be interested in saving public money and public sector reform.  Beside the proposed site for the library headquarters, there is an empty building owned by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company.  It is an office block and is perfectly suited for use as a library headquarters.  It is owned by the public and has been sitting empty for several years.  I asked why we should not put the library headquarters there and use the €35 million saved for other projects that are wanted by local people, that would create jobs, enhance tourism and so on.  The council will not do that because it is more interested in its pet project than in spending public money sensibly in a way that would create jobs.  There is no doubt that private developers will make up the architects and companies given the contract for this new library headquarters that nobody asked for and that does not need so much money spent on it.  These developers will be paid exorbitant amounts to build a facility we do not need.  All the activities that led to the property bubble are ongoing and there has been no serious attempt on the part of this Government to do anything about it.  I will be opposing this new Ministry and the policies coming from it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1097">I am also delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011.  This will see the Department of Finance effectively divided into a Department for spending and a Department for cutting.  Everybody seems to be in favour of reform as it is the flavour of the month and the new buzz word.  The problem is there is little agreement on what the reform should entail.  Few can define it and despite various reports, nobody seems to be able to do anything about it.  That is not a problem from today or yesterday but has been ongoing for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The new Minister responsible for public reform will have responsibility to figure this out, which will not be easy.  I wish Deputy Howlin well in his new role as Minister, and he stated that the Bill is the first step towards the creation of a revitalised and customer-focused public service in the country and placing a stronger focus on how we manage our public expenditure to get the best possible impact for available resources.  Along with the speech and the roadmap for this process, this is the mission statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Many hundreds of thousands of good and decent people work in the public service and I am not out to knock them today.  The mission statement which should exist has been badly sidetracked and lost.  The creation of a revitalised and customer-focused public service should be the goal, as most of the public service is not customer-focused.  I do not wish to show disrespect to public servants but I have a hope and enthusiasm that we can get this country back on its feet.  As an elected Member, I have the responsibility to argue that all public servants at all levels should perform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In fairness, most of these people are career public servants who joined the service at an early age with the best of intentions but the system has worn them down.  All public servants should have a "refresher course" where they could be put into private businesses for a couple of weeks every year to gain a basic knowledge of the need and demands posed on entrepreneurs and business people.  I differ from the previous speakers, Deputies Ross and Boyd Barrett.  I work with both of them in the Technical Group and although we share many ideas, we are broad enough to differ in many ways also.  There are fundamental problems in this issue which should have been sorted out long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The new Minister responsible for public reform must figure out what is wrong.  I wish both him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, well as they try to help our country's finances recover despite the heavy hand of our so-called friends in Europe.  I have remarked many times that with friends like those, one does not need enemies.  We must be more vocal in getting the message out that they are not helping us; at least the IMF provides money at a reasonable cost but those in the European Union are making a profit, despite the fact that their bankers caused half the problem.  I am worried about the ideological differences between the Ministers and the two parties in coalition.  There is an immediate clash.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">There will be a cross-departmental body to implement all the numerous reports done on public sector reform.  People were paid much money to produce these reports but we now have more of them than anything else.  One politician will be accountable for the delivery of reform and although I wish him well, I also wish him God's speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">On the negative side, the process will surely get bogged down before it even starts.  The new Department will be staffed by the same civil servants that have not delivered much to date.  I do not mean to be disrespectful but I am just talking about the system and how they are engaged.  This can affect many Ministers or ideological people in a Department; I know people who left the service because they would have ended up in the insane house if they remained in it.  They could not put up with the archaic systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Will there be a turf war between the two Ministers?  The culture of civil servants must shift from providing exclusively for their own Minister to a more comprehensive view of the joint functions of the Department, which will be a significant culture shock.  I have seen during my time in this House and participating in committees how civil servants defer to their Minister.  I was disgusted, annoyed and shocked when the pension levy was introduced and fought within my party at the time against it.  For whom was a U-turn done?  It was not done for county council workers on the ground, librarians or ordinary people in classrooms but for senior civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">That was a despicable move and I told the former Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that he had been hijacked.  I received no answer but when I challenged the measure, I was told that it affected 120 civil servants; in the end it affected nearly 700.  The pension levy was expensive and punitive enough for the ordinary people but the fact that senior public servants could get away with a reduction in its effect left a bad taste in the mouths of ordinary workers.  It was a retrograde step, of which there are more which we probably do not know about.  Nobody can tell me such action is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">Once the honeymoon is over there is a risk of division reflecting the points of divergence between the coalition partners.  We saw that last week with questions on the Order of Business and elsewhere regarding efforts by another Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  In fairness to that Minister, he is seeking a consultation period on the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements etc.  These systems were negotiated, as noted by Deputy Ross, by the so-called social partnership.  It was a great idea when it was started by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, but it got badly sidetracked and carried away.  As Deputy Ross argued, there is no point in blaming trade unions, which had a job to do in representing members; they did it well and we should take our hats off to them for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">I blame the likes of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Construction Industry Federation and the Small Firms Associations.  They became removed from the ordinary people who could not afford to be members of such groups.  People, including union members, were put on boards and participated in a gravy train.  We saw what happened when quangos were set up with directors placed on boards; for example, money was put in place for training of ordinary workers in the HSE but it ended up in SIPTU and we have not yet heard where it has been spent.  It was not put where it was supposed to go but spent on airline tickets and nights in hotels around the world.  The media describe junkets being taken by politicians as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">We must consider the roles of Secretaries General of Departments and chief executives of semi-State bodies.  The wages of bankers are capped at €500,000 and we should have a maximum wage for public servants.  I compliment the Government on returning the minimum wage to its former level, although that was not the problem.  The employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements set a basic minimum wage at €20 or €25 per hour, with extra money for disturbance and upset etc.  These facets were negotiated in a bubble which has burst, so we must try to attain real reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">I wish both Ministers well but they must tackle such problems.  Taxpayers and those with no jobs, as well as young people in our schools and colleges with enthusiasm and a good education, need a chance to deliver.  They will do so if allowed, as will ordinary businesses which have been shackled with remnants of social partnership.  We had legislation covering joint labour committees and bodies such as National Employment Rights Authority were set up; there is a problem in this country in that when we introduce new legislation we forget to get rid of the bodies created by older laws.  There are quangos and organisations which have outgrown their usefulness as a result, leading to expenditure we cannot afford.  We must sit up and smell the coffee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">We cannot blame the IMF and others for looking at such matters because we have closed our eyes to them for the past number of years.  If we are to prosper again or get any sense of hope, such problems must be tackled head on.</p>

        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1111">I wish to share time with Deputy Tom Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this legislation and in particular the speed with which it was produced, given the fundamental change it brings to our most important Department.  I have been impressed by the phenomenal speed with which this groundbreaking legislation has been produced.  The nature of the provisions is testimony to the Government's determination to deliver on our most important pre-election promise, namely, reform of the public service.  I regret that some of the previous speakers have left the Chamber because it seemed from what they were saying that they misunderstood the enabling nature of this legislation.  It simply sets up a Department and transfers the powers to effect reform to the Minister, which is a necessary precursor to introducing reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">I am not sure who first coined the phrase that the public service is not fit for purpose but he or she caused considerable resentment among certain people.  To resent that statement, however, is to resent reality and to confuse persons with process.  The purpose of the public service has changed dramatically.  Notwithstanding the current economic crisis, Ireland has grown and evolved, economically and socially, beyond recognition since the foundation of the State and the public service.  Over that time, the country has been transformed from a low income, poorly educated and primarily rural based society into a modern, largely urban, highly educated and technologically smart economy.  The public service has struggled to meet the changing needs of our people and economy but there has never been a fundamental restructuring, with the result that each new economic and social development was accompanied by a further accretion of procedures, practices and protocols, as well as bodies and agencies that offered well paid positions, particularly during the years of the Celtic tiger.  Many of these bodies were appropriate at the time of their introduction but have lost their relevance over time and are now outdated and no longer serve the needs of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The old ways of the public service strangled initiative and sapped the enthusiasm of thousands of capable and dedicated public servants.  The time is ripe for change.  Nobody wished for this economic crisis to happen but it brings into focus the need to renew our public service in a way that transforms administration rather than merely paying lip-service to the idea of reform.  This legislation will enable such a transformation.  The public service is not responsible for the economic crisis but it contributed to it through its deficiencies and shortcomings.  It did not recognise the crisis when it first emerged and it lacked the flexibility and expertise to take corrective action to minimise the impact.  Reforms can be made in many ways but the establishment of a new Department which allows an immediate and ongoing focus on the performance of our public service is essential.  While changes are needed immediately, reform has to be an ongoing process.  It is only through the ongoing questioning and scrutiny of every single function and penny spent that we will ensure the best delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">Nobody can deny that the Department of Finance has more than enough on its plate without taking on this massive task of reform but it will not be able to address these issues without change.  However, I suggest the Minister should be wary of denuding the Department of Finance of its expertise and experienced staff when officials are transferred to the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  Never has there been a greater need for the best available expertise than during this critical period of our history.  Many comments have been made in the media and elsewhere about the lack of economic expertise in that Department and this may be part of the reason nobody shouted "stop" when the banks went on a borrowing spree to fund the building boom.  It is probably futile to say what might have been but we must never leave ourselves exposed to that risk again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The Department of Finance is not the only Department which was found wanting.  The myriad of independent agencies, whether the HSE, the NRA or the NTMA, which mushroomed in recent years denuded parent Departments of their senior and best staff, who left for these well paid agencies.  The programme for Government commits to bringing in new talent and skills not only to the Department of Finance, but all Departments by ensuring all posts at principal officer level and above are open to external competition.  At least one third of all appointments over a period of five years will be reserved for those who are outside the traditional Civil Service structure.  However, I am concerned about how this commitment will be achieved in the context of an embargo on recruitment.  If ever we needed fresh thinking and new ideas, it is now.  We need to hire these people now rather than when the crisis is over.  I ask the Minister to ensure that, at the very least, the revenue raising and expenditure Departments, which are the core of the public service, are resourced and staffed by our best and brightest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">A commitment has also been made on cutting the number of State bodies, or the so-called quangos, which grew like Topsy during the Celtic tiger years.  This should be one of the first tasks of the new Department.  Some of them can be amalgamated or reabsorbed into their parent Departments but others are simply redundant because their functions have already been taken over by other agencies.  There can be no room for sentiment in abolishing the latter.  Costs may initially be associated with abolition because many of them have committed to leases and other agreements but these difficult decisions will have to be taken.  Every agency, programme and spending line will have to be examined for relevance, necessity and efficiency and for every euro spent we must ask whether the expenditure is necessary and if there is a better or cheaper alternative.  Crucially, we must ask whether the expenditure achieves its objectives.  The overall objective of reform is to guarantee the best service possible to the public, be that in education, fishing or vaccination programmes.  This will be a huge challenge in itself and we are all aware of countless examples of where aspiration and delivery diverged.  Only recently we learned that people who took State sponsored training programmes had a lower chance of finding employment than those who did not take them.  These improved services have, of course, to be delivered by fewer public servants.  Even if money was not an issue, our public service is too big and has to be reduced.  This will place great demands on existing staff.  Change is never easy, although the fear of change often stifles progress.  However, changed practices, flexibility and rotation of workers between Departments and bodies, as well as greater responsibility, autonomy and openness of Government, can enhance work satisfaction and opportunities for advancement.  The current system does not reward excellence and that has to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">Given the limited time remaining to me, I will briefly address the subject of procurement.  I am aware of one example of procurement in the health service in which a child's walking appliance had to be imported through a single agent at a wholesale price three times the retail price.  Surely somebody is in charge of procurement in the HSE who can search out value for taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I have not had time to deal with the area of local government.  While this may be slightly controversial, there is no excuse for the number of local authorities we have.  There are approximately 117 and there is no way that can be justified.  They should be a target for reform by the new Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomBarry" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
          <p eId="para_1120">I welcome the Bill, which provides for the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and the transfer of functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  It sets out three main functions, which will transfer under the remit of the Minister — the entirety of functions relating to the public service; public service reform functions which will, for the first time, be placed on a statutory footing; and responsibility for managing public expenditure within the overall envelope set by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">It is necessary to put the public service on a statutory footing because the Bill comes about after we learned an expensive lesson from the mistakes of previous Governments.  The legislation ensures the public service will be correctly matched in terms of size and skills to the business at hand.  As populations change, domestic need and other external influences change and the public service needs to be flexible over time.  It also needs to mirror what has always been done in the private sector.  Flexibility and cost awareness are the two foundation stones on which all business is based and they have been strengths of the private sector up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">However, a new approach comprising flexibility and cost awareness will also have to be applied to the public sector, which will have to be run with an efficient and delivery-based approach based on business acumen.  Change is never easy and it is always resisted but we are in a position where we cannot play semantics.  Change will happen one way or the other.  Some elements of the public sector might not like it but, unfortunately, the message is that if change does not happen, those who obstruct it will have to move aside and allow those who will undergo change to do their job.</p>

          <p eId="para_1126">Public sector employee numbers per head of population are still growing faster than the EU average in Ireland.  Armed with these figures, the appointment of a Minister to oversee the public sector and expenditure is vital if we are to work our way out of this financial crisis.  Let us not forget why we are here.  This crisis was caused by a reckless Government which acted with callous abandonment and ran the country on to the rocks while surrendering our economic sovereignty 80 years after gaining independence.  I am trying to run a business on cash flow without the support of the banking sector and conditions are absolutely terrible.  I am not prepared to listen to those who say this just happened and we are where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The increase in public sector numbers between 2000 and 2010 equated to false employment and a non-productive growth area.  It was a costly way to reduce the unemployment figures but, sadly, it was not targeted or sustainable.  The facts bear this out.  The Exchequer pay and pensions bill more than doubled from €8.32 billion in 2000 to €18.75 billion in 2010.  Let us examine the arguments on both sides.  We have the argument that we have a bloated public service that needs to be reined in and there are many examples in this regard while the opposing argument is the public service delivers an efficient and vital service to keep our country running on a daily basis.  In 2010, however, the health and education sectors accounted for 43% and 32%, respectively, of total public service expenditure.  These two sectors are vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Section 7(4) also transfers a number of services currently under the remit of the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, including the Commissioners of Public Works, Public Appointments Service, Commission for Public Service Appointments, Valuation Office and the State Laboratory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Under section 8, the Minister will assume responsibility for existing non-statutory functions of the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach and play a role in public service reform and in the promotion of value for money in the procurement of goods and services.  Procurement is important because every company has two ways to survive the mess we are in.  One is to buy more competitively and the other is to provide a more efficient service.  This Bill in the longer term will prove valuable to the creation of an efficient public service of which we all can be proud.  Public service bashing has gone on for too long.  We are a great country to create divides among various sections of our small population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Like political reform, public sector reform is being approached in a systematic, businesslike fashion by the Government.  Detractors berate the Bill as creating duplication and additional layers of bureaucracy.  However, it provides a tightened management structure in the public sector which, in time, will help to lift the morale of public servants and allow the public sector to become more transparent, thereby providing value for the taxpayer, which is its job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I hope the Bill will also address the outsourcing of work, which would be done by public servants, to private sector companies.  The potential of the legislation is vast and it is important to get value for money to allow the economy to grow and to ensure sustainable growth.  I come from the private sector and the advantages it has will be mimicked by the public sector, which will make it competitive.  It is important to look forward and to make the public service an attractive place to work for our brightest and best youngsters.  This Bill will prove that in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1132">I wish to share time with Deputy McGuinness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The legislation has been much discussed and it formed a central plank of the policy of change the Government sought to spin to the public during the election campaign.  Sadly, this is a bit of a fudge.  The establishment of the Department is a solution to a political problem, one which arose previously when Fine Gael and Labour were last in power.  At that time the Labour Party leader believed he should be Taoiseach and sought to create the machinations that went with that.  The Office of the Tánaiste was established.  It was an expensive extension to bureaucracy to which Deputy Barry alluded in terms of the growth of the public sector.  At the time that was one such example.  A Department was created purely to fulfil the ego of the Labour Party.  The belief was that there was a necessity to establish the Office of the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The same has happened on this occasion.  The thinking of Fine Gael prior to the election is clear.  Its manifesto promised an office modelled on the office of the ministry for children, not a Department.  That was a copy of the example in the UK.  The Government can spin all it wants about the high-minded commitment to reform which underlines the Bill but the simple fact is that the Department is being created because Fine Gael and Labour could not agree on who would be Minister for Finance.  Those are the facts.  The approach the Government is taking underlies that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1138">If they could not even manage to decide who would be the Minister for Finance at the outset of the negotiations it is highly unlikely that they would be able to instil that across the 340,000 staff who work in the public sector.  It is not an easy job to introduce change.  I caution the Government on taking a high-handed approach or using bully-boy tactics to pursue its agenda.  I hope that is not the agenda the new Minister is going to pursue.  I doubt that it will be.  With the greatest respect to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, I have every confidence in his capacity to manage the change that is necessary within the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">We all recognise the necessity for change.  In a situation of much reduced public expenditure as a result of a much tighter fiscal position there will be a requirement in some cases for fewer services.  At a time when we had a greater buoyancy in the economy increased services were possible but the finances are no longer available to the Government.  The change must be managed in a fair and equitable way.  It must try to meet the most obvious and basic needs of society.  The jackboot approach will not work in that regard.  Change must be managed in a careful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The role that has been created for the Minister is confusing.  As my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, indicated, there is a necessity to deal with the public reform agenda.  That in itself is a broad brief.  I am not sure that confusing reform with the review of public expenditure is a good combination.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Seán Fleming are my party's spokespeople in the area.  They have carried out a detailed analysis of the Bill and believe it will lead to greater confusion rather than greater certainty and less oversight rather than more, which is to be regretted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Reform of Government fiscal policy and control is clearly needed.  Various parties have published their proposals in that regard.  Fine Gael's proposals did not include a new Department when the matter was discussed prior to the election.  It suggested an approach akin to the UK chief secretary system which involves a Minister sitting at the Cabinet table with responsibility for public expenditure but who is subservient to the Chancellor and has no separate Department.  While the Deputies opposite are correct in identifying the necessity for greater political involvement in the functions of the Department, there should not have been a requirement to create a separate Department.  It will add to confusion rather than simplify matters.  To some extent having two people at an equal level may bring about a greater level of conflict and make it more difficult for decisions to be made.  As those of us who have worked in the private sector know full well, where there are two managers rather than one it can often prevent progress.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_1143">Indeed.  Deputy O'Dowd would be familiar with that. The Bill proposes a split in responsibilities and mixed competencies, which is not to be found anywhere else in the world.  All claims by the Government to the contrary are untrue.  Independent expert reviews of the Department of Finance recommended major reform, which is supported by all parties, but also explicitly advised against splitting the Department.  The more one looks at the detail, the more confused it becomes.  It is a recipe for conflict, bad policy and reduced accountability.  It marks a backward step, not a positive one towards reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">I am confused that the normal procedure associated with a policy position such as this was not followed in terms of the publication of a White Paper which would show exactly how the new fiscal and economic machinery of Government is supposed to work, including Estimates and timetables.  That is an unacceptable oversight, in particular because neither party mentioned it prior to the election.  In terms of accountability, it is not even clear who is responsible for the Bill that bears the name of the Minister for Finance.  The press release was from the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The proposed change impacts deeply on the roles of both Ministers but it does not appear that both will be involved in the consideration and amendment of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">A total of €11 billion in revenue is included within the Estimates.  That makes the difference between the gross and net Estimates.  One cannot, for example, determine the gross spending on higher education without determining fees and the allocation of ESF funding yet according to the Bill all revenue decisions remain in the hands of the Minister for Finance.  Considerable confusion could result from the confused manner in which the Bill was brought to the House.</p>

I am concerned that we will find ourselves dealing with some of the difficulties the Government will encounter trying to bring together the views of both Fine Gael and Labour in what is clearly a difficult agenda.  We look forward to contributing to that.  I will conclude on that note and hand over to my colleague.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_1156">I wish to make a distinction between the Bill as presented and the intention of the Bill.  The Bill as presented gives rise to a number of questions which need to be addressed.  I hope that some of them will be addressed in the context of Committee Stage amendments.  I refer in particular to the functions of the Minister for Finance and the new ministry held by Deputy Howlin.  Looking through the Bill it is apparent that one must ask the other for permission to act.  I foresee a great deal of tic tac and correspondence between civil servants on proposals.  That must be clarified.  The management and delivery of what is intended in the Bill must be sorted out to provide for day to day issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">It was interesting to hear the Minister, Deputy Howlin, refer to the fact that we now have a system that is not fit for purpose.  He also referred to the fact he will create further reductions of between 18,000 and 20,000 in the number of civil servants over a period.  That is an unusual departure for a Labour Party Minister, and I wish him well in his crusade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The Minister went on to say how important is the Croke Park deal.  I respect that deal is important, but let us hope it does not turn out like social partnership, where most of the deals relating to the State and its management are carried on outside of the House.</p>

Deputy Varadkar spoke out in the past few days and he was chastised too.  There must be a certain freedom in this House and on the Government side for people to have a different view and people must be listened to in the context of the great debate currently under way about fixing this country.  I do not accept Deputy Barry's conclusion that it was all our fault.  Fine Gael does itself no service by continuing to blame Fianna Fáil for all of the ills of the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_1162">Any business person would admit that other world issues had an impact.  I accept we in this country managed badly and did not respond to issues when we should have in 2008.  Fine Gael is now in government with a huge mandate and I wish them well, but they must take the necessary decisions and not postpone them.  They must not put them off for another day and must not cloud the issue by presenting poorly worked out legislation such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">That said, I would like to address the reform issues included in the Bill.  Reform is not about reducing numbers from 18,000 or 20,000.  That is reform in terms of numbers.  The reform required in the public service and Civil Service is about culture change, a change of management and a change of attitude towards a job that is being undertaken.  Reform is not necessarily about those on the front line, because they deliver every day by the sweat of their brow and under serious pressure.  It is about delivery in terms of management of the public service and Civil Service.  It is about the 2,000 to 6,000 extra people we are told are in the HSE.  It is not so much about getting rid of them, but about reducing the numbers of middle and senior managers who take significant money out of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">I said previously that the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, took a reduction in his salary, as did the rest of the Ministers.  That was a reasonable decision to make, but the bigger and harder decision is to turn to the Secretaries General and tell them that their salaries need to be reduced to a level below €200,000.  That is a fact.  As Fianna Fáil leaves office and Fine Gael comes into office, the latter is faced with the same set of bureaucrats and civil servants at that level who assisted the previous Government, as put in Deputy Barry's terms, to affect negatively the growth and development of the economy.  They are still in place.  Should they not be reshuffled also?  Should they not take a reduction in their salaries?  I believe they should and the Government should have the ability, perhaps under this ministry, to reshuffle those square pegs that are in round holes.  They should not be removed, because that is not compassionate or good management, but should be put where they fit best elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The Government must also bring in measures of payment for lower paid civil servants that will recognise their worth.  It must create a culture, value and enterprise system within the Civil Service that will lead to a seamless transfer from the public sector to the private sector or from the private sector into the public sector.  We can count on one hand the number of people from the private sector who over the past few years went for jobs in the public sector but failed to get in.  That is the challenge that faces the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">It is as much a challenge as that put by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, when he said we should eliminate all the quangos.  When quangos are eliminated those who are on the boards disappear, which is maybe what should happen, but those employed simply go back to the parent Department.  That is where they are.  Therefore, there are no savings in doing that.  There are no savings unless the Government asks those serving on the boards, whom it will appoint, to do it for nothing in the interest of the country.  What is wrong with asking them to do it for free?  Is that not reform?  Get rid of the quangos and put them into a single quango.  Let them administer a number.  There are many examples of how management in the private sector can be applied to the public sector and of where it will work.  It comes down to a culture change and an acceptance, within the Croke Park deal or outside of it, that things must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">How much has changed since the Croke Park deal?  I would say very little, but I do not want to say that without having the information on it.  Therefore, I will ask some parliamentary questions in that regard.  However, when one will ask each Department what has been achieved, whether it has met its targets, how and where, and the numbers and savings involved, it will reply that it cannot answer the question and will refer it to the Department of Finance.  As Deputy Stagg continually repeated when in Opposition, Members should be respected and when they ask a parliamentary question, they deserve a full, comprehensive and honest answer, with nothing taken from it.  Then the Member can act on the response if he or she so wishes.  However, that does not happen.  Currently, when one puts questions on this issue to Ministers, who had so much to say when in Opposition, those questions are then referred to Deputy Howlin.  He must be the one who will be the bad news Minister for the Government.  I ask for change in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">It is easy to have reform, without the Bill or the Minister, although I am happy to support the Minister with stronger legislation.  To have reform, just ask officials to answer their phones.  Ask them to answer their letters and to have respect for the Members of this House.  Ask the HSE to deal constructively with the carers we saw in that programme this week on television.  Just ask them to respond to it.  Ask them to go out publicly and tell their story.  Ask for the issues that are presented at the Committee of Public Accounts to be addressed substantially so we do not have the overspend going on and on, regardless of who is in Government.  I am not being political on this, but am putting this forward in the interest of Ireland and of getting it right.  What gets counted gets done.  If we achieve that, we will achieve value for money and will give those in the public service and Civil Service the opportunity to get promotion based on their ability rather than on their longevity or time in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">These are some of the few things, in terms of reform, the Government could do that would make a huge difference to the ordinary citizens who elected us to this House and gave the Government an overwhelming majority.  The challenge for that overwhelming majority is not to ignore democracy.  There is an Opposition, regardless of what the Government thinks of us.  We deserve that right, just as the Government did in its time in opposition but we did not give it to it.  Do not prolong that approach to politics, because we now have a new politics and new approach to business.  It is a new approach to public sector management that will take us out of this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey</from>
          <p eId="para_1172">I acknowledge the Bill is an effort to transfer functions from the Department for Finance to the Department of public expenditure and reform.  I wish to comment on Deputy McGuinness's contribution before he leaves the Chamber.  He has been very frank and I agree with much of what he has had to say.  When his party was in Government he was a lone voice and it is a pity that he was not listened to when he was speaking out about the reforms that were necessary during the Celtic tiger years because clearly the horse has bolted to a large degree.  We now find ourselves with our economy almost €20 billion in debt on public expenditure over the revenue that is coming into the Exchequer.  This follows a property boom that was propagated by consistent Government policies over a 15-year period that blew the property boom into a property bubble.  Many agreements were made in that period that we are now finding very difficult to sustain.  People spoke earlier about social partnership.  I have always believed that while social partnership may have been very good in many ways, it also had many negatives.  I publicly criticised the role of unions and the lack of oversight of Government and employers in allowing many of those agreements to be implemented into what we now find is an unsustainable economic model.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Disaster has struck in economic terms and we now realise that old ways will simply no longer work and that there is an urgent need for public sector reform.  If we do not act now, we will be left with no choice.  Whatever choice we have now is diminishing all the time and with the EU-IMF bailout agreement, unless we act urgently and swiftly we will have very little choice over our economy and the future of our country and we will certainly be controlled by outside powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">I will give some examples of what I regard as unsustainable practice.  As a Senator in the Upper House I raised the issue of bonuses to county and city managers and directors of services that were paid by agreement under the Better Local Government programme.  These bonuses were paid for the achievement of objectives to which the mayors and the elected representatives of those councils were not privy, which was a disgrace.  While I know they are no longer being paid, when I and others questioned them at the time we were stonewalled by the Department and Government.  We wanted to know for what those large bonuses were being paid.  We were told initially they were being paid for the achievement of objectives in the very local authorities where the elected members were not aware of them, which is not the way to do business.  I understand that these bonuses were a trade off for increased pay and that the bonuses would be paid quietly.  I believe almost 100% of the bonuses were paid across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">Local authorities have already taken a big hit and their front-line services have been reduced considerably.  However, we do not see the same impact across the Civil Service.  I agree with Deputy McGuinness that there are many senior and middle managers in the Civil Service who now need to bite the bullet and accept that serious and urgent reform is required at those levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">While I am not being populist in saying this, one should consider the money wasted on e-voting and the PPARS system in the health service.  How many heads rolled when that waste of public funds happened?  More than €50 million was wasted on e-voting and €100 million on PPARS.  Not much notice was taken at that time because there was plenty of money in the Exchequer, but if that happened now there would rightly be a public outcry.  We must now have accountability where public funds are wasted.  I hope the reforms the Bill will introduce will bring those levels of accountability.  Unless we have accountability across the public service for the levels of public spend, we will not see responsible expenditure on behalf of the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">I recently discovered that the Waterford branch of the Family Mediation Service, which is supposed to assist vulnerable people who suffer family break-up and operates under the Family Support Agency, was forced to close temporarily for a number of months owing to the embargo on recruitment.  When I investigated further I discovered that the Family Mediation Service is paying €1,000 a week for offices to deliver its services, which is unacceptable in this day and age.  I do not know how those contracts are entered into.  There should be an examination of all rental and contractual agreements of public services and agencies, and how they are expending taxpayers' money.  There is no reason those agencies could not operate in community centres or in less costly facilities.  That is only one example of which I am aware and I am sure it goes on in public agencies across the country.  They certainly need to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">There is great scope for change, but we need to bring society with us.  I agree that it must happen from the top down.  The Taoiseach has taken pay cuts as have Deputies and Senators and there may be more in the future.  Anybody earning more than €200,000 — there are thousands of them — needs to look seriously at that level of income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  Some semi-State agencies have already achieved great efficiencies.  For example, the ESB underwent an enormous transformation in the Celtic tiger years.  In the early 1990s it employed more than 14,000 and it now employs only 7,500.  It still manages to deliver its service even though there was a much bigger demand on connections and network refurbishment during the Celtic tiger years.  However, owing to a transformation agreed between unions and management, voluntary redundancies took place throughout the organisation.  It managed to achieve efficiencies and continue to deliver its services and remain profitable.  It can be done and it has been done.  We must remember that the ESB used to be one of the most militant organisations from a union perspective.  We must set the bar at a particular level and look to where achievements have already taken place.  That is one area where there have been achievements.  If similar models or similar systems of progress are used in the public sector, we can generate new efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">Another issue that has arisen in my constituency, Waterford, is the closure of the local authority motor taxation office in Tramore, which is the second largest urban area in the county.  I have not come out publicly and argued that the motor taxation office should be retained, because I understand that the local authority resources are now greatly diminished and it does not have the staff numbers it used to have.  However, I have called for the examination of alternative practices such as access to motor taxation renewal through the post office network, similar to what is available in the UK.  There is no reason not to use existing State services and infrastructure such as the post office network to make it easier for people to complete motor taxation renewals or any other renewals.  We need to think outside the box.  I accept we should use the Internet, but we must realise that not everybody has access to the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">We also need to achieve new efficiencies through shared services.  There is no reason for each local authority, VEC and every other State body to have its own payroll centre.  We could have regional shared services to deliver payroll services that are similar, if not identical, across local authorities and VECs.  We need to introduce shared service-models and new efficiencies.  I hope the Bill will give the power and functionality to the new Minister and his Department to achieve those efficiencies in the best interest of the taxpayer because we simply do not have any alternative at this moment in time.  If we do not act and implement those reforms, that power will be taken out of our hands.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1182">I welcome the Bill.  I want to put it in the context of some of the issues that have been raised in the House during the week concerning the great difficulty being experienced by people who are caring for people who are vulnerable or ill.  The real tragedy is not just that this terrible social difficulty arises now but that it also arose when the State was flush with money.  During the so-called tiger economy years, in spite of expenditure across so many different areas we continued to see high levels of social need and evidence of money not being spent well on delivering on the target for which it was authorised.  Everybody in this House will have experience of the various areas of expenditure to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">All of us on the ground noted how much of the money spent by the Department of Education and Science during the period in question was spent on paying for additional prefabs and rented accommodation.  It was supposed to be spending it on something sustainable and delivering an asset the people would own.  In the health sector, which presents the clearest example of what I am referring to, the money being invested when funding was abundant in the State increased by almost a factor of two.  During that period, however, we still saw people on trolleys and waiting lists for those seeking operations lengthened.  We received considerable feedback in our communities from people who were finding it very difficult to access services that would make a considerable difference to their health and well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">Social welfare expenditure increased greatly when money was available but so much of this money was being obtained fraudulently.  People were receiving money who should not have been receiving it and they were receiving it in ways that were not proper for our country.  At a time when we had so much money, we saw waste, and social need was not being alleviated.  It should be no surprise to us all that we see an intensification of the need to which I refer at a time of real difficulty.  However, this should not blind us to the fact that the need existed when so much money was available to the State.  This is the rationale for the new Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I was struck by the comments of Deputies McGuinness and Coffey.  Many of the points Deputy McGuinness made were included in his book <i>The House Always Wins</i>.  Many of the reasons for the House always winning, Deputy McGuinness believes, comprise the justification for the putting in place of the Department.  It is a case of having a soulless Minister and Department whose job is to tackle the forces that ensure systems do not use the money invested therein in the most efficient way and ensure it is managed to miss the target.  The target is often the vulnerable, the people who experience terrible difficulty when the country is in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">As we talk about the need that exists, we must bear in mind that between 1997 and 2004-05 taxpayer-funded expenditure in the State nearly doubled.  The increase was unparalleled in Irish history and is nearly without parallel in many countries across Europe and the developed world.  Despite the unparalleled increase, social need was not being addressed and there was unacceptable waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">When the new Department gets up and running, there will be four areas in which it would do well to spend its time delivering a return for the taxpayer.  The first is a soft area but it is very important to the success and leadership of the public service.  I refer to training.  The Wright report, which considers the capacity of the Department of Finance to carry out its role, contains very clear figures regarding the level of training for staff in that Department.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1188">However, 39 economists in the Department of Finance is extraordinarily low by international standards.  Even excluding the public service cadre of 135 people, this represents less than 10 percent of the total staff complement in the core of Finance.  In contrast, 60 percent of the Canadian Department of Finance are economists trained to Masters level or higher; and about 40% of staff in the core areas of the Dutch Finance Ministry are trained to Masters level or higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">This is an extraordinary point of difference.  I hope that as we put in place a Department that is focused on public service reform and expenditure, it will allow its staff to develop their skills, education and qualifications so they will be able to do their job exceptionally well.  We must bear in mind that the challenge of obtaining good value for expenditure is as old as the first nation state.  There is considerable learning available on what can be done and I hope the new Department will tap into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">The second area on which I want to touch, which was referred to by Deputy Coffey, concerns the role of semi-State bodies and the salaries of some of their staff.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, commented on this area yesterday and they were reported on today.  I want to touch also on the level of wages for very senior staff in the public service.  It is evident but essential to note that there should be very few examples of public service staff earning more money than the people elected to lead the public service, namely the Taoiseach or Minister of a Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The lack of coherence on the aforementioned point was brought to light in two different areas in the past 12 months.  The first concerns the application of the wage cuts and the pension levy.  Staff at the top of the public service saw their wages decrease by a smaller percentage than those in the middle and lower ranks.  The second concerns the application of the pension levy.  Many organisations were exempt from having their staff pay the levy because of the nature of those organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Let me consider the salaries of staff at the top of the semi-State organisations.  The ten chief executives of the main semi-state organisations are paid €4.4 million between them.  If we are to have a sense of national solidarity as we pull through the collapse — it is a sense that is fraying greatly already — we must tackle these inequalities.  I hope the new Department will play a lead role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">The third area on which I will touch is the role of social partnership.  I very much hope the Croke Park agreement can play a role in delivering costed savings to ensure the number of staff in the public service and their wages do not have to be examined further.  Deputy McGuinness gave an example of when we will know when the Croke Park deal will be working: it will be when the answer to the question as to how much is being saved within a Department by a particular plan being either implemented, changed or cancelled can be given on the floor of this House through that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">My final point concerns the comprehensive spending review, a new initiative announced by the Government.  This process, on which the Government wants to deliver, should be ongoing.  It should involve an ongoing, strong, detailed review of how taxpayers' money is being spent because the length of the budgetary process that leads to the budget in December has proven to be too short.  The report on the capacity of the Department of Finance states the Department did not provide enough time and space for a rigorous process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">This legislation and the new Department can make a very important contribution to our State navigating its way out of its difficulty and, if it does so, to a very important softer element of our society, our national solidarity.  They will do that by ensuring big and tough decisions are made in a fair manner.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1198">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill.  I believe the purpose of this Bill and this Department is to fundamentally undermine the public service, destroy jobs and undermine the availability and the provision of public services to the general public.  That process started under the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and is now being continued by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government.  Effectively, the public service staff are being blamed for this recession.  They are a soft option and are seen as easy targets.  They are being blamed for a recession in which they had no hand, act or part in creating.  The provision of public services is being undermined, delayed and in some cases is not available at all.  We saw in the recent "Prime Time Investigates" programme some of what is happening on the ground as a result of the various cutbacks in public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">As usual, it is the lower paid and the middle ranking public servant who is facing these cuts, the undermining of the service, and the pressure of work.  The senior public servants who are very well paid and have very good conditions escaped scot free.  If their jobs become vacant they will be filled, unlike those of the middle ranking and lower grade public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">I have worked in the public service for approximately 30 years and I have also worked in the private sector.  In my experience staff in the public service work above and beyond the call of duty on an ongoing basis.  There is no doubt that is the case, even more so in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">I refer to an independent evaluation by an international organisation which examined the public service.  In the OECD report, Public Management Reviews: Towards an Integrated Public Service in Ireland, it is clear that the Irish public service compares very favourably with other public services in the European Union.  The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1202">A policy since the mid-1990s to limit non front-line service employment has meant that public sector spending and employment growth have not kept up with population and GDP growth.  [In other words, it has failed to keep pace with population and GDP growth].  Ireland's real average annual growth rate in public expenditure between 1995 and 2005 was 5.1%, significantly slower than real GDP growth of 7.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">That is seriously falling behind the growth in GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The report goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1205">Government policy therefore has actually <i>decreased </i>the total number of public sector employees as a percentage of the labour force and <i>decreased </i>the overall public sector wage bill as a percentage of GDP.  As compared with other OECD countries ... government employment in Ireland represents around 14.6% of the total labour force, which is relatively low among OECD countries and is significantly less than the level of public employment in Norway, Sweden, France, Finland and Belgium.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">That is an international independent organisation telling us that we have a public service that started from a very low base and has provided good quality public service and compares more than favourably with our partners in Europe and with other OECD countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">What has happened since then is that further cutbacks have taken place.  As the Minister stated, we have lost 16,400 public servants since 2008 and this Government proposes to destroy another 25,000 jobs in the public service in the coming years.  What does that mean for service delivery and for staff?  It means no replacements on any vacancies that arise due to the moratorium.  It means there is no cover for maternity leave, sick leave or annual leave.  It means there is huge pressure on staff, and staff are becoming ill from the pressure of the daily grind that is forced upon them.  It also means that in respect of the services, if one applies for a carer's allowance or a disability allowance one will wait 20 weeks for a decision.  That is in circumstances where those staff are working above and beyond the call of duty.  If one appeals a carer's allowance decision, one will wait 12 months for the appeal to be heard.  That is the position across all the services including special needs assistants, resource teachers, home helps and care assistants, as we saw on our television screens in recent nights.  In addition, there is a six months waiting list for medical cards, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">What we need is support for the public sector and the provision of good quality public services for people who need them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1209">This Bill clearly gives legal effect to the division into two Ministries of the role formerly held by the Minister for Finance.  There is a need for a Minister with a public service reform agenda.  As that did not happen in the good times when the money was available it makes it more difficult to do it in the bad times, and I acknowledge that.  It is something of a blank cheque at the same time because we all know that public service reform is needed but it is a tough chestnut and it depends on the way that public service reform is done.  It is important that this measure is not simply code for cuts but that there is a modernisation programme.  It is important to have a Minister with that exclusive focus and a modernisation agenda at the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">I support the need for public service reform but that should not be code for cuts or for privatisation.  The service must be rebuilt in a way that is efficient, makes best use of the limited public funds available and is much more citizen focused which as we all know it is not currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">We should acknowledge also when there are successes.  Brendan Gleeson, in his contribution during President Obama's visit last week, said we should stop looking at the ground.  He is right, but if we are to do that there must be some balance.  Those in the media have a role to play in that because there tends to be a latching on to a failing or some crisis in the public service and no acknowledgement of the contribution made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Many civil and public servants are working harder and for less pay.  They are constantly being told they are lucky to have a job.  If we are all to put on the green jersey and if we are to stop looking at the ground, then there needs to be some appreciation for the work done by the vast majority of public servants.  The majority of them have a desire to see a modernisation of the service in which they work.  They want to see a service that they can be proud of, but I do not think it is that service.  Even if we had all the money in the world, a modernisation programme would be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">There is an obvious deficiency in the Croke Park agreement.  The voice of those who avail of public services is largely missing.  I do not see a master plan and this is a concern.  We may end up with a smaller public service but we need to rebuild a service that can deliver the maximum with the money we can afford to spend.  It is in everyone's interest that we design and rebuild a service that takes account of the needs of those who use it, and not just those who deliver it.  This is absent at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">I attended the launch of the report of the Ombudsman for Children this morning.  Mr. Austin Currie launched the report and he was the first Minister of State with responsibility for children.  He said his concern at the time was the lack of co-ordination.  It was interesting that the case studies in today's report referred to the same lack of co-ordination.  As public representatives, we do not need to be told about this because we see it every day.  People approach us with their child with special needs who have just been given a diagnosis.  They do not know which way to turn.  That is the reality for many people.  It falls back on the parents and only those who have the wherewithal to do so can provide for them.  If I go into a house that has a child with special needs I will always find a big bundle of folders, as the parents will have become permanent lobbyists.  That is because of a failure to have a seamless approach to the delivery of services, where the health and education services interlink and talk to each other.  That does not happen and it must be part of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">I posed a question to the Ombudsman about the Croke Park deal and her input.  She was positively disposed to engaging with the issue.  This is somebody who knows the failings because she deals with the cases, yet we are not using her as a resource.  I know it is a statutory agency, but I would like to draw attention to this.  If we are to go through this modernisation programme, we must have the output that we all desire, which is a better service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">We need to simplify the service.  We need to define what constitutes a front line service and we need equity in the delivery of services, including their geographical location.  Deputy Durkan on that side is a constituency colleague and he will know exactly what I am talking about.  Areas in the outer part of Dublin have experienced rapid population growth but we have not received the corresponding public services to match that.  We were the first to feel the cuts in the public service because they were low from the beginning.  Embargoes represent a blunt instrument, so there needs to be some tolerance within the reformed system to account for that.  For example, we have the lowest ratio of gardaí to population size.  Kerry County Council has twice the number of staff as Meath, yet Meath has a slightly bigger population.  All those things matter to the quality of services delivered and they need to be taken into account when dealing with public service reform.  It is unacceptable that there is an inequitable distribution of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">We also need to work smarter.  An ICT system cannot be designed in a fragmented way, or else one system will not communicate with the other.  That has happened in the past and it has been very wasteful.  It cannot be done in a piecemeal way, but it can only reflect the system that exists.  We must design our public service systems and work smarter by using ICT but we must design the systems with a plan that delivers on the potential of modernisation using smarter systems.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1218">Change is in the air and reform is very much on the agenda, especially with the debates in the House this week and the Private Members' motion from the Technical Group.  The Minister tells us that the Government is committed to fundamental review, reform and the overhaul of all aspects of government and administration in Ireland.  The programme for Government also envisages a renewed focus on a range of related reform issues to facilitate more open, transparent and better government, giving citizens a greater choice and input into service delivery.  Our Private Members' motion is about rebuilding Ireland's political system into an effective, accountable, transparent, representative and participatory institution.  We have so much in common — desire for change, effectiveness and accountability — that we might all be voting the same way tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The Minister identifies the kernel of this as leading to "a changed, more effective and less costly public service".  Doing more with less seems to be the prevailing theme.  There is no doubt that money has been squandered in the good years but we need to promote values besides money, and not just value for money, important as that is.  We need a public service ethos to serve and empower the public and not institutionalise the system in an inertia that degrades people.  I acknowledge that there are great demands on our public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I also attended the launch this morning and the Ombudsman for Children made the point that a recent analysis of the office's casework provided supporting evidence for the need for public service reform.  She pointed to a lack of awareness of the impact of civil and administrative decision making on the lives and rights of children and their families.  She made the point strongly that, as she put it, "individual children appear to be largely invisible in the decision making process, the result being an excessively bureaucratic approach to public decision making and a disconnect between the administrative decision makers and those affected by their decisions".  Bureaucratic decisions can be made but those decisions should not lead to harm for the child where the child's needs are not met</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">We need a culture where children are treated properly, and the Ombudsman for Children makes the point that law, policy and practice should reflect the value of treating every child "no less than we would want the child we love treated".  I hope that value is at the core of this reform, along with value and respect for the dignity of each citizen, especially when dealing with challenging behaviour from some citizens.  The system has to serve the people and not the other way around.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">In yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Fintan O’Toole wrote an article entitled “Gravy train still stops at all the right stations”.  He wrote about a bubble of comfort and self satisfaction.  It is a kind of “let them eat cake” mentality that exists when we consider the gross inequalities in our society.  So when I look at section 7 of the Bill, which refers to chief executive officers, is the Government really going to grasp that nettle and cap the salaries of those at the top?  Will it commit to eliminating bonuses and will it at the very least reduce expenses by 50%?   Can we have a penalty for those who use bigger cars, rather than the other way around?</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">In the interests of justice and morality, we cannot expect those on low income continually to take the hit.  We must commit to the principle that those with more surrender more to reduce inequality.  I hope such a principle will be at the core of this.  The universal social charge, water charges and property taxes may have been acceptable in a time of plenty, but not at a time of struggle because they will lead to further inequalities.  It will result in a massive on low and medium income homes and make them more dependent on public services when in difficulty.  The DPP's office, corporate enforcement and pursuing alleged wrong doings in financial and business affairs cannot be sacrificed at the alter of employment number reductions, nor can essential front-line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">The Minister mentions traditional public service values of integrity, impartiality, diligence, commitment and the ability of public servants.  As a former teacher in the public service, I can testify that those values were in abundance among my fellow teachers.  I hope the extra-curricular work that has always been done is acknowledged because that extra hour being sought could do more damage, as many teachers give much more than it, be it in sports, debates, school productions or school tours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">The Croke Park agreement is seen as an opportunity to drive forward public service modernisation.  However, there should be an extension in respect of retirement, so that those in public service with vast experience and with the ability and the wish to continue work should not be forced into retirement because they will be at considerable financial loss if they do not retire by next February.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">Another point I want to make is that I resent recent moves to pit the poor of this country against the poor of countries in Africa.  It is immoral to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">Reform is key, but it must be thought out, based on expert advice and centred on people in need.  I had a letter from a friend which has reminded me of the differences between these groups.  It states that the optimist believes in the continuous march of progress, without really getting into how that is going to happen, the pessimist is usually so disengaged that his pessimism protects him from having to do something by projecting the idea that nothing can be done and the realist has a rational belief in the human capacity to solve and cope, provided the action is realistic.  Realistic action needs to be daring and radical.  That means starting from the top and keeping the needs of the people in mind.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1228">I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  As you and I know, a Cheann Comhairle, we have had public service reform in the past, we even had a dedicated Minister for the public service in years gone by.  However, over the years, the mission statement has become clouded and we have arrived at a situation in which major public service reform is required.  It is also demanded by the public.  As previous speakers said, there is an expectation among the public that services will be delivered from whatever Department.  Even in difficult financial times such as those in which we are living, there is still such an expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">We must examine the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the services we provide and how they are delivered.  A problem that has arisen over the years is that Governments have devolved responsibility to outside bodies that were previously attached to Ministers, who, in turn, were responsible to this House.  How often have we heard, over the past years, that the Minister has no responsibility to the House for something?  Sitting on that side of the House, we were told again and again that X, Y or Z was not the responsibility of the Minister, despite the fact that all Ministers had budgets from which they took sums of money that they handed over to bodies that were not accountable to anyone.  We have now come to a juncture at which we must ask ourselves some questions.  How efficient and cost-effective are the services we have, and are they delivered on time and in a responsive way?</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">I compliment those who are dedicated public servants, of which there are massive number.  Ninety-nine percent of all public servants are dedicated public servants who wish to do a good job but are often frustrated for various reasons, find themselves hamstrung and cannot respond in the way they want to.  Whether we like it or not, we have handed over responsibilities to various quangos, to use a word I do not resort to very often — unelected and unaccountable bodies that have taken upon themselves a great deal of autonomy in the way they do their jobs.  That must finish.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">What is proposed here is the transfer of responsibility from the Minister for Finance in respect of a number of services, including the entirety of functions relating to the public service.  These transfers include the functions of the Minister for Finance with regard to a number of offices currently under the remit of the Department of Finance, including the Commissioner of Valuation, or the Valuation Office.  This has been the subject of some discussion in recent times, with particular reference to how valuations are arrived at in determining rates, in view of the fact that ratepayers are having great difficulty meeting these demands in a recession.  Other functions transferred include those relating to the State Laboratory, the Commissioners of Public Works, the OPW, the Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">As Deputies know, there was reform about seven years ago in which the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, which we had lived with for many years, was changed to a different system.  Many of us spoke against that at the time, and we were right, because it did not improve efficiency or the quality of life of those within the service and did not at all address the issue of job satisfaction, which is important for those involved in the delivery of services to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">The first thing we must recognise is that the public expect a response.  Sometimes the response is fast, efficient and effective but sometimes it is not.  There are various reasons for that failure.  It may be because of a lack of staffing, a lack of focus, or a lack of responsibility or shared responsibility.  My experience has been that where responsibility is shared between two, three or four bodies, eventually nobody accepts responsibility.  Everybody has authority, everybody has power, but nobody accepts responsibility.  That is how it has been for a long time.  I hope the Bill will address this in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Another proposal is to place public service reform functions, for the first time, on a statutory footing.  In other words, the legislation is there to back it up, and all that is needed is to refer to the legislation and follow up accordingly.  How often have we seen legislation of a creeping nature which evolves of its own accord, or the appearance of rules and regulations that take on a life of their own and have progressed to the extent that one would scarcely recognise the original legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">The Bill also transfers the responsibility for managing public expenditure within the overall envelope set by the Government, while the Minister for Finance will retain responsibility for overall budgetary parameters.  Many years ago, the copious application forms that were required to be filled out for a simple tax return were a source of irritation in the House.  Form 11 was devised as a simple answer to what was a frustrating problem for many people.  Over the years, however, that has evolved as well.  A couple of other forms and a couple of other pages were added on, and eventually we arrived back to where we were 25 years ago.  A simple local authority housing application form used to have two pages.  My belief is that it should be possible to fit onto two A4 pages, printed on both sides, information about an applicant that is sufficient to give the adjudicating authorities a clear impression of who the person is, his or her family circumstances, and his or her entitlement to housing of whatever nature.  However, it is now no longer possible to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">We now have forms of 27 pages and more, some of them in duplicate, with the same questions asked again and again.  I cannot understand the point of it but I know it causes people to spend more time perusing them.  It now takes four people to do the job that one person did previously because of the volume of correspondence that is placed in front of them.  We all know, as Members of the House, that when one gets a copious document one looks at it once or twice and then pushes it to one side.  If there are 40 or 50 pages in it, one will push it to one side a second time or a third time.  The problem is that the content within the document may need urgent attention, which it would have got if it had been simplified in the first place.  A situation has evolved in which shovelling paper from one desk to another has become so laborious that it occupies people's time in such a way as to deflect from their original mission and the job they are supposed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">As legislators, we are supposed to know about legislation.  Most in this House have a fairly good idea of what legislation entails, what are people's entitlements and how the law should function.  However, we regularly get lectures from everybody on what the law consists of, or we find that perhaps somebody went to court about something.  We know that all legislation is subject to court decisions and so on, but there was a time when any public representative was able to tell a constituent in five minutes about his or her entitlement to local authority housing, a medical card or social welfare payments of one kind or another, or about issues of planning permission in urban and rural areas, and could walk away in the clear knowledge that good advice had been given.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">What happened?  Evolution, through changes many of which were introduced by that august body, An Bord Pleanála, and others on the recommendation of local authorities or the County and City Managers Association, the combination of which leaves us requiring a PhD to study some of the documents placed before us to find out what exactly they are supposed to do.  One would need somebody to carry around the various documentation and such a person would be gainfully employed — and seriously, laboriously and physically employed — in the course thereof.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">Reform of the public service must have at its core a determination to reduce the volume of duplication, cross-referencing and repetition of the same performance by four or five people when one person is all that is required to do the job.  This Bill, coming as it does at a very difficult time, has been brought upon us out of necessity.  If it had been introduced eight or ten years ago the necessity now would not have arisen because the problems would have been resolved or would never have arisen and we would have a much more efficient system operating cost effectively, rapidly and in a far more satisfactory way from the point of view of the people we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">Something for which I try not to blame myself, although it has become popular for everybody to blame themselves for everything, is shirking responsibility.  If we as elected representatives shirk responsibility because of a dislike for doing the unsavoury, we hand over responsibility to somebody else.  People who are not elected will gladly take it upon themselves and they will evolve what they see as legislation-based rules and regulations for perhaps the betterment of the community or perhaps not.  However, this is what happens when public representatives and legislators opt out and resile from the responsibilities they have been given and the job is taken over by somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">What we now have on a regular basis are people presuming to have responsibility and authority, and acting thereon in a way which raises serious questions, is laboriously repetitive and which eventually grinds down the system to make it entirely dysfunctional.  A classic example is the wisdom of the House a number of years ago in creating a new body called the HSE.  Like many people at the time, I was very reluctant to do so.  We saw it as an offloading of responsibility by the powers that be, namely, a Department, and handing it over to a private body, which is what the HSE is.  A private body took over full responsibility and the Government of the day and the Department handled over the money lock, stock and barrel.  This body runs the services according to the way it sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">At this stage, it is no secret that things have not run in a satisfactory fashion.  The reason for this is because there was no accountability.  It is in respect of accountability that the major part of reform has to focus in the time ahead.  If we do not have this focus, the legislation we propose to pass will have no effect and in a couple of years we will find ourselves in the same situation and people will ask why the services do not work, why services are not available to the public which wants them and why things do not happen when they are supposed to.  This should not happen because once we put in place legislation we should accept responsibility for it.  We should try to ensure it works in accordance with the wishes of the legislators and not in accordance with somebody's interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">I am not a legal practitioner and nor do I wish to be but I remember a time when often in the courts a Minister's Second Stage or Committee Stage statements were quoted as a means of determining what the Minister's intentions were at the time the legislation was passed.  Nowadays, one could have somebody else's intentions; it could be a second-hand or third-hand interpretation of what the Minister's intentions were at the time.  Regularly, people suggest they know what the Minister was thinking when he introduced legislation.  I have been around the House for quite a while and most of the time I find it difficult to understand what anybody is thinking.  How can somebody once or twice removed come to the conclusion they knew what a Minister was thinking when legislation was introduced without ever making reference to the debates in the House during which the legislation was passed?</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">I hope this legislation is effective and that it sets a new standard of accountability for those areas in which we do not have accountability.  We have accountability in some areas and we have good and efficient delivery of service.  However, standards have slipped over the years.  As we all know, when I was first elected to the House when one tabled a parliamentary question one thought about it and those to whom the question was addressed read it carefully.  They did not come to a conclusion as to what one was thinking when one tabled the question, they answered the question exactly and precisely as it was asked and they were right to do so because that is the way it should be.  Over the years, this became vague.  I do not blame the present Administration because it is addressing the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I remember when I was in Opposition tabling questions to which I knew the answer.  People might wonder why I tabled a question if I knew the answer but there are always benefits to getting confirmation that the person to whom the question is addressed also knows the answer and is prepared to put it on the record of the House.  Once upon a time, if a Minister gave a misleading or inaccurate reply to a parliamentary question his or her resignation was called for.  Over the years, we have slipped because we allowed everything to pass and slide.  Now, we have a convoluted system that is hugely bureaucratic and repetitive, and many systems are at cross-purposes to each other and have multiple responsibilities or no responsibility at all.  This is a sad scene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">The way we have evolved the delivery of services is not in accordance with best practice, the wishes of the public or, in very many cases, with those engaged in delivery of those public services.  For my sins, I served on local authorities and on the old health boards, as did most other Members for their respective sins, of which there are many I have no doubt.  Over the past ten or 15 years, reform has taken place in the local authority system and today nobody can honestly say with hand on heart this reform has benefited anybody.  It has made it more unworkable and created more bureaucratic enterprises in the system than ever before.  The old health boards were faulted and a previous Government decided to change them.  As I stated, it introduced the HSE.  Prior to that, it increased and reduced the number of health boards and eventually ended up with a mishmash which was unaccountable, irresponsible and had to be changed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1247">Is ait an rud é go bhfuil an rún seo ar an gclár an tseachtain seo, os rud é go mbeidh díospóireacht againn ar an gceist chéanna amárach.  Ag an am céanna, measaim gur mhaith an rud é go bhfuil an tábhar seo á phlé againn.  Tá roinnt smaointe breise mar gheall ar athchóiriú na Dála á nochtadh ag na páirtithe difriúla.  Is féidir linn díriú isteach orthu.  Tá sé tábhachtach go ndíreoimid isteach ar conas gur féidir linn a chinntiú go bhfuil gnó na Dála — Parlaimint na tíre seo — oiriúnach don aois ina bhfuilimid.  Tá éileamh i measc an ghnáthphobail go seasfaidh an Dáil chun díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe éagsúla is cúis leis an tinneas atá ag cur isteach orthu faoi láthair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">I have two issues with the motion proposed by the Technical Group.  The abolition of the party Whip system would, in some ways, put me out of a job and there is a lack of understanding in that regard.  Those of us who are elected as members of a political party believe we have a mandate to uphold party policy as the party directs us, having stood on a platform for that party.  Therefore, the party Whip system should stand because it reflects democracy and the vote the electorate has cast.  I am not suggesting people should not stand on an independent platform but when the electorate elects a Member to the Houses of the Oireachtas, who has stood as a member of a political party, the electorate understands the outline of that party's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">There is, and should always be, a role for difference in the Dáil and Seanad.  That difference should be encouraged as much as possible to ensure many voices are heard in this House and that it reflects more and more society as a whole.  One of the issues I have in terms of Dáil reform is not the technicalities or the changes to Standing Orders but the need to try to ensure the people elected to the House reflect society so we need more working class Deputies and more women.  There has been quite an encouraging debate for the past number of years on how this institution can attract more women to be Members of Parliament.  Whether that is done on the basis of quotas or by penalising parties through the Leaders' allowance, it is an issue we need to tease out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">We must ensure the people enacting legislation for our society reflect it.  The Dáil should not be dominated by people from a certain profession or class, as has happened in the past.  I will try to ensure that my party sees to it that the people representing it reflect the society in which they live and work.  To date, we have done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">A proposal in the motion is to provide legal advisory capacity to the Dáil.  There is some legal capacity in the Dáil through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the committees.  I presume what is intended there is that legal capacity should be available to Deputies in order that they have access to the advice of a legal team about legislative proposals they wish to make or to answer queries about legislation coming before the House.  I do not believe that would be a problem and it would be a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">There are some welcome elements in the Fianna Fáil and Government amendments to the motion.  That is why it is strange that there is a motion.  The motion and the two amendments form the basis for Dáil reform.  The Chief Whip has been trying to engage with the other Whips to try to set the wheels in motion on a package of Dáil reform measures.  Some of what is contained here can be looked at in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I find it interesting that Fianna Fáil has belatedly come on board in regard to the Dáil reform challenge.  Movement from the previous Government in regard to Dáil reform was quite slow.  I sat on the Dáil reform committee for nine years and progress was slow, if there was any at all.  That was not only because of Fianna Fáil — in fact, among the worst in terms of blocking Dáil reform was the Labour Party which did a deal with Bertie Ahern when he was Taoiseach to allow him to absent himself from the Dáil on Thursday but quite soon afterwards, it said we could not have a Dáil reform package unless the Taoiseach attended the House on Thursdays.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">It is good that there are new Members in the Dáil who have a different outlook because sometimes one can become institutionalised and it is hard to take criticism of the institution.  Just because a debate in the House is staid or stale, it does not mean one must change things because change for the sake of change will not work.  The Dáil has developed over time, as have other parliaments.  If one goes to any country, one will hear parliament is out of touch or does not reflect what the public wants.  That is a failure to understand the role of parliament.  It is not only a debating shop; it has quite a valid job of work in dealing with legislation, holding government to account and so on.  There is a balance to be struck between having a debating shop, whether at Leaders' Questions, and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The only time one sees a full press gallery is when there is a bit of a row between the Opposition and the Taoiseach or a Minister but the normal day-to-day work, which is the most important, grinds on.  When legislation is published, it is introduced in the House, goes to a select committee and then comes back to the House.  That can be most frustrating and laborious work but it can also be the most rewarding because one gets a full understanding of the legislation.  One can sometimes win over a Minister to one's point of view and legislation is changed and one manages to protect someone who is less well off or some group in society which will suffer the consequences of legislation which might be rushed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">I found it frustrating that the document, Regulating Better, produced by the last Government was not implemented.  It called for regulatory impact assessments, which is included in the motion.  In all my time in the House, I believe I only saw that mentioned in two Bills.  If nothing else comes of this latest push for Dáil reform, an assurance that we will, in future, have legislation published in time to allow us properly to analyse it would be welcome, together with an undertaking that all legislation will be accompanied by impact assessments.  Without knowing the full impact of a Bill, or at least having some idea, it is difficult for Members on either side of the House to assess it.  A requirement to provide a regulatory impact assessment would also encourage those who are drafting legislation to have a greater regard for its effects.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
          <p eId="para_1257">The Government has committed in the programme for Government to a radical reform of our system of government, at constitutional level, at political level and at Dáil level.  The Government will significantly reduce the size of the Oireachtas, with the proposed abolition of the Seanad being put to the public next year in a constitutional referendum.  The switch to a single-Chamber Parliament would create an Oireachtas that is more effective, efficient and in tune with our democratic ideals.  Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand have all abolished their second Houses to create single-Chamber Parliaments.  When the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition, announced that our party in government would give people an opportunity to vote on the abolition of the Seanad, it was called a gimmick.  Within 18 months the other political parties were in agreement with that policy and it is now included in the programme for Government.  The people will have their say on the matter in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">In the interim the Government will try to ensure we have an efficient Seanad with a real work ethic that will offer a reformed way of doing business in the time remaining to it.  The Taoiseach's 11 appointed Senators showed a break with the past by including a number of independent individuals from outside the political system.  These include Dr. Martin McAleese; Eamonn Coghlan, the great Olympian athlete and director of the Children's Medical and Research Foundation at Crumlin hospital; Fiach Mac Conghail, director of the Abbey Theatre and chairman of We the Citizens; Mary Ann O'Brien, founder of the Jack and Jill Foundation; Jillian Van Turnhout of the Children's Rights Alliance; and Marie-Louise O'Donnell, lecturer and media contributor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">I am currently meeting with the Opposition Whips to devise proposals for Dáil reform.  Work has already started to establish a boundary commission which will review the findings of the recent census of population and seek to reduce the number of Deputies.  Reform has been an issue that many Governments have discussed but few have acted upon, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh observed.  This Government will be different.  We have proposed a radical reform of the way the Dáil operates to make it fit for purpose in the 21st century.  The programme for Government undertakes to increase the number of Dáil sitting days by 50%.  This will involve reducing the length of breaks at Christmas, Easter and during the summer and returning a day earlier after bank holidays.  This has been the first Dáil to sit during the week of St. Patrick's Day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The Government is also reforming the Oireachtas committee system.  The new system will break with the practice of the previous Government which was designed to find jobs for Deputies rather than to ensure we had a functioning part of the Oireachtas.  We will have fewer committees and they will be focused on detailed work programmes.  Deputies and Senators will be members of fewer committees and will thus have more time to meet the demands and opportunities the new focused committees will provide.  The vast majority of Members, in all parties, want to contribute in a meaningful way to the running of this country and to serve the Irish people.  The radically reformed committee structure will give them that opportunity.  In addition, we will ensure that Oireachtas committees have full powers of investigation.  A referendum will be held to address the Abbeylara Supreme Court decision which currently limits the ability of committees to undertake effective investigations into crucial issues of public concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">Following consultation with the Opposition Whips I will bring forward reform proposals before the end of this session.  I hope those reforms will be in place by the second week in September when the Dáil returns after the summer break.  They will enhance the functioning of the House and afford Members more opportunities for effective debate.  That is what Members on both sides of the House want and what they were elected to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickDeering" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Deputy Pat Deering</from>
          <p eId="para_1262">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important issue.  Like many other Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, I fought the recent general election on a reform platform and I support the radical reform proposals in the programme for Government.  It is ironic that the Technical Group should introduce this motion given this Government's reform programme is more progressive than that of any of its predecessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">The reform agenda kicked off on day one of the Government's appointment with reductions in remuneration for the Taoiseach and Ministers.  One of the Taoiseach's first acts was to reduce his own salary to €200,000.  This was followed by a restructuring of the ministerial transport system.  Who could forget the sight of fleets of Government Mercedes driving into Farmleigh and Government Buildings, sending out all the wrong signals?  Under the new Administration only a few Ministers have access to State cars.  These reforms will be followed by a reduction in the number of Deputies once the boundary commission has reported.  In addition, the people will have their say next year on whether the Seanad should be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">The most important area of reform must be in local government.  The most frustrating aspect of my time as a local authority representative was that local government cannot finance itself.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, must be commended on his first step towards reform through the announcement yesterday of a new household charge.  Although it has been described as harsh by some the charge will ensure money is ring-fenced for local government.  For the first time in years local authorities will be able to raise their own funding.  This will take the pressure off and may allow them, for example, to reduce commercial rates, a major bugbear for businesses in every town in the State since the recession began.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">I have some concerns about the introduction of a 30% quota of female candidates for all political parties.  Women should be elected as a right rather than as a consequence of a quota.  There are many fine women involved in politics and many more will become involved in the coming years, with or without a quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">Important first steps have already been taken, even though we have only been in government for 80 days.  By the time of the next election I am confident that radical reform will have been achieved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1267">Some Senators will say in private that the Seanad as it currently stands needs to be abolished.  That is why they argue in public that it must be reformed immediately in order to ensure there are checks and balances in our democracy.  We could spend the next five years in this Chamber seeking agreement on reform of the Seanad instead of addressing the real problems with our democracy.  Our democratic deficit will not be corrected if we do so.  The problems for democracy in this State lie in large part in this Chamber.  It may be somewhat paradoxical, as Deputy Deering observed, that the greatest reform we could make to this Chamber would be to make reform externally, at the layer of local government.  However, we are debating Dáil reform, so I will focus on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">From my brief time in the House I wish to make some observations that may help to make our time in this Chamber more meaningful.  I make these comments in the knowledge that not many people are listening.  That is part of the problem.  I also make them knowing that they are ideas and need to be fleshed out in debate but we will not be afforded that opportunity in this Chamber.  That is part of the problem.  It bothers me that speaking time in this Chamber is divided equally between parties and groups rather than between elected Members.  It is not right that Members elected to this Chamber should be excluded from the debate because there is insufficient time when it is distributed between the parties and groups.  Time should be divided between those who want to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">It is not right that people come in here and use certain Standing Orders or rules of procedure to raise issues in the Dáil that they know cannot be addressed just so that they can go back to their constituents and say they raised the matter in the Dáil.  It serves no purpose.  It is Potemkin politics and it is a waste of everyone's time.  Matters on the Adjournment fall into this category.  To be able to raise an issue with the Minister and to receive a reply is no small thing but we cannot question the reply from the Minister.  What is the point?  We serve as postmen and postwomen.  We might as well write a letter or an e-mail.  If we cannot question the answer we are given, we are wasting our time because there is no debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">In my time on Dublin City Council, I often went into the chamber without knowing what way I would vote.  Through the debate on the issue, through the power of people's words and constructive engagement, I was persuaded to move one way or the other.  That is a powerful process.  I tried to take part in certain debates and to move others with my words and that too is a powerful process.  In my time there, through constructive engagement with each other, our decisions and actions were all the better for having a debate.  We had to know our material and we had to stand up and defend it.  We could not hide behind the party line because there was no party whip.  There used to be free votes in this Chamber and we should consider returning to that system, whereby Members can vote on the basis of the debate.  Then we would have to take positions and able to defend them in this Chamber.  That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">We need to transform this Chamber into a debating chamber, where opinions are given but also heard.  Through constructive engagement with all sides of the House we can do collectively for this country what nobody can do individually.  That is the root of parliamentary democracy and the system of checks and balances we need in Dáil Éireann.  Strong, democratic governments require strong parliaments, which require strong opposition.  Nothing I see so far in the operation of this Chamber lends itself to that idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">We have seen this Chamber used in the past as a vehicle for the Executive to legitimise its actions.  That serves no one well.  I and the Government, including the Fine Gael and Labour parties, are committed to changing that.  All Members are.  That is why I commend this motion, which gives us time to discuss these issues and to try and find agreement, even though this is not proper debate.  It is important that we do it together because the benefits will accrue, not to each of us as individual representatives in the benefits we try to gain from our work, but to the country as a whole because politics will have improved.  Better decisions will be made on behalf of the people of this country, who we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">We are fortunate to have the parliamentary system we have so I ask that we use it as it is meant to be used.  It should not just be a place of great speeches — there have been some great speeches from all sides since I have been here — but as a place of great debate.  It should be the seat of responsible, accountable and proper decision-making in this country.  I commend the motion because it has afforded us time to discuss this.  I wish us all the best in our endeavours as we set out to achieve what so many of us promised in the recent general election campaign, to improve politics in this country.  It must start in this Chamber.  Through our collective will and actions we can do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1284">We do not hear much from that quarter.  The history of Whips is that they were engaged as loyalist supporters of the Prime Minister to go into alehouses and houses of pleasure around the Parliament in Britain to beat the Members of Parliament out of them and to come in to vote.  The Whips in England are still given a ceremonial whip when appointed.  We should change that in this republic and call them co-ordinators or a more suitable name.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">I am a long-standing Whip and my job is to listen to the views of the parliamentary party Members at the weekly meeting and to consider the various votes that will arise in this House.  We make a decision collectively and I must ensure that Members vote accordingly.  The Members have voluntarily taken a pledge to do so.  If they want to be in the group, they must do so.  If one wants to be an Independent, one can be an Independent instead and then one does not have to have a consensus.  The proposal to abolish Whips would create anarchy in this House.  People like Deputy Boyd Barrett and the opinions in the Technical Group mean that one could make no decisions on anything.  No parliamentary institution in a democracy in the world is without some form of Whip system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">This Chamber is a legislative Chamber, it is not a debating society.  The only reason the Government gave space in the past number of weeks to debates about nothing was that there was no legislation prepared.  Normally, after being elected, the Government would go into recess for a period to allow legislation for the programme for Government to be prepared but that did not happen in this instance and it was a mistake.  As a result, there is plenty of time to debate issues without any result.  That will not continue.  When the legislative programme is up and running, there will not be time to allow the Opposition to criticise the Government.  That is effectively why they want the debates.  They can do that in their Private Members' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">Holding the Executive to account is the primary function of this Chamber.  Since the election, I have encouraged the Labour Party backbenchers to raise questions on the Order of Business, to table oral and written questions to the Government and to raise matters on the Adjournment.  There is not need for much encouragement but I ask them to continue to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_1292">One of the major issues we need to address is that we have transferred power out of this Chamber to over 1,000 quangos.  This point is not covered in the proposals in this motion.  We need to recover that power.  The power was given to us by people who sent us here.  We transferred that power, unconstitutionally, to quangos outside this Chamber and we must recover it.  We must bring it back to this Chamber so that the people are restored the powers they transferred to us when they elected us.  That is essential.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1293">I welcome the motion from the Technical Group and I welcome the commitment to what is a priority for the Government contained in the programme for Government.  Unfortunately, the big idea from the Technical Group is to turn the Dáil into a collection of Independents.  They want us to be recreated in their image and likeness.  They want to abolish the political party system.  I must tell them that politics is a serious business and representative democracy requires teamwork, policies and collective action.  Independents, by their nature, are individual politicians and as such are something of a political luxury that a parliament can tolerate or accommodate.  Nevertheless, there is no parliament composed entirely of Independents that could function effectively, as Deputy Stagg has clearly noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">Ironically, the Independents have recognised the contradictions in their own status by now combining in a Technical Group which is not that far from a party.  For all practical purposes they have become a political grouping to function in the Dáil; they even have a Whip or perhaps a couple of Whips.  They speak with many voices but vote as one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The amendment proposed by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, contains a package of proposals which is far superior to the rather minuscule set of proposals outlined in the original motion.  It would be very interesting if the Independents followed the advice in their own proposal, which suggests the abolition of the political Whip system to allow individual Members to vote according to their conscience and not by instruction.  Will they practise what they preach?  If they do they will observe that the package of proposals coming from the Government is far superior to what they tabled and they should exercise their individual conscience by supporting the Government's amendment.  That would be an obvious action if they are to follow their advice in telling Members to vote with their conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The extent of the reform proposed by the Government is absolutely unprecedented.  Local government is to be reformed and the role of the Oireachtas will be enhanced through significant investigative powers to be vested in committees.  A constitutional convention is to be held to consider wide-ranging political and constitutional reforms and it has already been announced that there will be a 30% gender quota, to be increased to 40% after the next election.  These will radically reform the political system, and it is the first programme of Government in the history of the State which has made such comprehensive reforms a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">I will speak for a moment about an area which has not yet been mentioned, the role of national parliaments with regard to the European Union.  Ireland's stance in the European Union has been diminished in recent years with a negative consequence on our political and economic well-being.  This programme for Government is the first to contain a detailed set of proposals to transform our relationship with the European Union and bring European matters to the heart of Oireachtas proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">European Union policy and legislative proposals will be subject to proper scrutiny, which has not happened in the past.  Each committee will share the burden of dealing with policies and proposals relevant to their remit.  Legislation will no longer be processed on the nod through statutory instruments, as has been the custom in the past, and Ministers will now be held to account by committees before attending meetings in the European Union.  Likewise, the Taoiseach will be obliged to brief the Dáil before attending European Council meetings.  That never happened in the past, although the Taoiseach may have attended the House a week or two later to relate what he was told by the representatives of Germany or France.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">There will be an important new role for this Parliament in ensuring that the policies of the EU comply with the principle of subsidiarity, thus giving the Oireachtas a watchdog role as protector of the national interest in all European matters.  For the first time, the Oireachtas will be proactive and instigate proposals for the draft annual work programme of the European Commission.  The Oireachtas will also link with the offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament to engage in a wide range of in-house and outreach activities in communicating the European project to the Irish people.  Proper engagement with Europe will enable Ireland to lead from the front instead of having to pick up the pieces when things go wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">If the Technical Group had enough time to read the full and comprehensive programme for reform, I am sure the members would have no problem voting for the Government amendment to the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_1301">My two colleagues have dealt with the Technical Group motion and been reasonably critical of the group for bringing it forward.  I will not repeat those comments and I will not add to the criticism on this occasion as the actions of the Technical Group have been helpful.  There is no reason there should not be debate in this House about the need to change the way the House operates and the practices which may be in existence for decades.  As Deputy Eoghan Murphy argued, we should address the elements that should be changed and I have no problem with the debate or the Technical Group raising those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">The point regarding the Whip system has been ventilated and I will not repeat it other than to pose a question.  How could it be abolished and who would do so?  How can the Dáil determine that people cannot come together in a voluntary way through a political party, make decisions together by compromise and come to the House to vote in a particular way?  It is not open to the Dáil to abolish the party political system or the Whips in the sense proposed in the motion.  As a result the argument against the Whip system is really unconvincing, demonstrating a frustration which Independents in the Dáil and Seanad have with the system.  That is natural and although there is a luxury in being an Independent, those Members must also face the obstacles relating to the processing of business and the ability, essentially, to get work done in this Parliament.  As Deputy Stagg and others have argued, practices have evolved through political parties because they are at the heart of our current system.  Apart from that it is good to have this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Everybody is in favour of reform and apart from the Whip issue, we are probably all in agreement.  There is very little difference between the original motion and the amendments.  Calling for reform is one thing but implementing it or setting it out on paper is another.  Prior to the election, the Labour Party carefully and at some length examined this issue.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, set out a document of 140 proposals for genuinely radical change that would appeal to Members on all sides of the House.  It took us a considerable period to analyse the problem and set out proposals which could be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Deputy Murphy is right to express frustration at how the House operates but change requires the unpicking of practices that have been here for a while and the way business has been done for years.  Every time we look at a practice we can find a reason for its existence.  Although we may want to get rid of it, we can see the rationale behind it so we have to unpick the practice in order to change it.  We should do that and every Member should be involved in the process.  The necessity for reform should not be the subject of contentious debate, although some of the individual aspects may cause people to differ.  Deputy Stagg is right when he states that the process is ongoing and the impression should not be given that the matter is purely within the remit of the Government.  Opposition parties should be involved, and I hope they will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I was struck by some of the debate when Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke more broadly about civic morality.  It was a good issue to bring to the heart of the debate and there is a great expectation among people for this Dáil.  This does not just relate to the economy and the principal issues that must be addressed but how we do our business.  People expect change and want to see it happening.  That is a reason it is good for us to proceed with the constitutional convention, although there is little detail yet as to how it will operate.  That would be a genuine opportunity for us to examine the kind of republic we have and the sort of change we want to see in the republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">I will comment on the committee system.  Although everybody is arguing that the committees should be vested with true powers, I will repeat the argument because it is so important.  The committees should be given a genuinely enhanced status.  It should not just be a question of rhetoric that the Government will take committees seriously — as I am sure it will — and provide additional resources; we must see that happen.  As parliamentarians we should stand up for the Parliament and our independent role, separate from the Government, even if we support that Government.  We have a crucial role to play on behalf of the people who sent us here.  We are right to demand that the Government should take the committees seriously, attend them and resource them.  They should have an enhanced status.  We also have a responsibility in regard to how we conduct our business in committees.  Opportunities for grandstanding and set pieces should not be permitted and we need to learn discipline in, for example, scrutinising witnesses and asking questions.  Many people have forgotten how to ask questions.  A question is not a statement.  I say with all due respect to my colleagues that we should take the committee system seriously.  Let us be seen to make it work rather than simply expect the Government to do all the heavy lifting.</p>

Last night the Minister, Deputy Howlin, seemed to have a problem with the divergence of opinion on these benches as to what we should do with the Seanad.  He criticised us for not thinking the same way.  It is a strange notion that we should all behave like sheep or sing of the same hymn sheet even though we were elected as Independent Deputies.  If the Deputies opposite want to agree on everything, that is their prerogative, but people should also be entitled to hold divergent views.  I was delighted to hear the independent view set out by Deputy Eoghan Murphy in his contribution.  Deputy Costello was not as keen on the idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_1315">I completely agree with Deputy Stagg that it is outrageous to take power away from Parliament by appointing unelected members to quangos and paying them too much money, although we probably would not agree on much else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Most of us will agree that the House is in need of reform.  The general consensus is that it does not function like a Parliament and it would be healthier if it was reformed.  I had a frustrating experience today when I tabled an oral question to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I was here for the duration of Question Time but my question did not come up because it was two questions away when the debate concluded.  Of the 14 questions answered after priority questions, 11 were answered in the absence of the Deputies who tabled them.  Obviously party colleagues are permitted to deal with the questions, which is a crazy practice.  If a Deputy tables a question he or she should be here to deal with it.  It was pure madness.  I would have sat through the debate anyway because I was interested in hearing what Members had to say but it is a bad rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">I will be delighted if the Government introduces reform and it will certainly earn my praise if it does so.  However, some of the reforms will involve asking turkeys to vote for Christmas, which they do not like to do.  Certain reforms would allow us to press the Government for greater accountability but there is a reluctance on the Government benches to expose themselves in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">From my experience of dealing with planning issues, I found local government to be poorly structured.  The notion of electing councillors without allowing them to make decisions is madness.</p>

The way local government is funded is madness.  Insufficient funds are made available and we have one of the weakest systems of local government and the most centralised government in western Europe, which is to the detriment of society.  I agree with the proposal to divert a certain percentage of income tax to local authorities but they also need greater capacity for raising taxes at a local level.  If people can connect taxes to the delivery of services, they will be more inclined to pay.  I am out of time already.  I will have to revisit the matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1324">The fundamental issue in regard to reform is the accountability of politicians and the political system to the electorate.  We need to put an end to the tactics pursued in the last election.  Two parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, were elected to Government on a platform which asserted the bailout was not acceptable and would have to be renegotiated.  One of the words used was "obscene".  Subsequent to their election, however, they have acted on the same basis as the previous Government.  There is no fundamental difference between this Government and its predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The absence of accountability to the electorate can be addressed in at least two ways.  A system should be put in place whereby the electorate is able to recall politicians who stand for election on a particular platform only to change their policies on entering the Dáil.  The original Irish Constitution, as well as a number of European countries, made provisions for popular initiatives whereby a certain percentage of the electorate can call for a referendum on decisions taken by the Government.  Accountability to the people is key and if these two measures were implemented politicians and the political system would have to be accountable and transparent.  They would no longer be able to operate on the basis of promises which are dropped after the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Various other issues arise in regard to Dáil and local government reform.  I agree with those who stressed the importance of Deputies being in the Chamber when their parliamentary questions are taken.  The idea that somebody else can deal with the question is not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">Before speaking on local government reform, I express my appreciation for the recently retired manager of South Tipperary County Council, Ned O'Connor, who gave 47 years of service to the county.  He was absolutely committed to the social and economic development of south Tipperary over those years.  He was prepared to listen and learn and was committed to the future of south Tipperary.  I wish him well in his retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">However, I refer to three issues concerning local government.  First, like Deputy Wallace, I favour the funding of local authorities by the Exchequer with a ring-fenced percentage available to them to provide services.  Second, powers must be devolved to local authority members because, in recent years, more powers have been taken from them.  Third, county managers should be elected.  Those three proposals would change local government for the better.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_1329">I would like to point out something without doing so in a spirit of triumphalism.  Apart from the Technical Group Members whose motion this is, why are there only three other Members present?  What does that tell us about the Dáil and the way we do our business?  This is not unusual.  This is an important motion about improving the way we do business, yet only three non-Technical Group Members are present.  That shows that Members think it is more important to be somewhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">It was unnecessary and unfair of Deputy Costello to criticise the Technical Group for tabling the motion because it is constructive.  I am proud of that the fact that the group, of which I am a member, can table such a motion; its members can vote differently on issues and hold completely different views while working with each other in the interests of democracy and the workings of the House.  Why are so few Members present?  It is not just because of this motion.  One of the reasons is Members prefer to be in their offices doing constituency work or to be outside the House doing something else.  It is in their interests to do so.  That is the result of the multi-seat PR system, under which we were all elected.  It is in all our interests to keep it that way and, therefore, the incentive is to be on the telephone working the constituency and not to participate in the processing of legislation in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">There is a well known phrase that one talks one's way out of the House, not into it.  The cynics say if one spends too much time speaking in the House, one will lose one's seat because one is not on the ground.  If the system is changed and the number of multi-seat constituencies is reduced, there is a good chance that Members will come to the House and take legislation seriously.  I am glad the Minister is present and I hope he will consider this suggestion because it would be in the interests of the House, which is 95% empty most of the time, to introduce a system that encourages Members to be present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">I have long suspected the other reason few Members attend the House is most of them believe the real action is offstage where power is held by Ministers, lobby groups and the social partners, as was mentioned earlier.  This is less the case than heretofore, thankfully, but it is still an issue.  Members regard decisions made in the House as rubber stamps.  Legislation is not likely to be changed in the House and, therefore, we go through the motions.  I may be wrong and a finance Bill will be taken next week.  Let us see how Committee Stage goes and how many amendments are accepted but my guess is very few, if any, will be because this is a theatre rather than a legislative chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">We will have to stop Government backbenchers, in particular, accepting that they should act as lobby fodder, which is their traditional role.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy apparently made an enlightened contribution earlier.  I am sorry I did not hear it but he is an exception.  There has been a tendency for backbenchers to accept a role as lobby fodder and not to participate in the business of the House in a meaningful way because they believe they will not achieve very much.  That should end.  There is a possibility through the committee system, which the Government has promised to reform and strengthen, of playing a real role and sending a message that Members on both sides of the House can play a real role.  However, there are dangers in the Government's proposals for committees.  They propose to reduce the number of committees in a concession to public opinion and the need to reduce expenditure but it is a great pity that many of the chairman posts will go to Government Members.  Let us not pay the chairmen in order that there can be no accusation that the appointments are being made as sops to members of the Government parties.  Let us then appoint——</p>

          <p eId="para_1338">I congratulate my colleagues in the Technical Group on tabling the motion because the Government's response is interesting.  It was with no great surprise that I noted the amendment begins, "To delete all words after ‘Dáil Éireann'...".  Almost every Opposition motion over the past three months has elicited the same response.  Is there not a word or sentence in the motion in which the Government can see merit?  The motion recognise the lack of intellectual and political debate in the Chamber and my colleagues have reflected this in the issues they raised regarding accountability in our election to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">The motion also recognises the need for change and attempts to generate a debate on this.  For example, on this motion, two amendments have been tabled.  The Technical Group has called for the abolition of the Whips system.  Fianna Fáil opposed this and called for a balance between the rights of parties and their mandate and the mandate of Members but the Government amendment makes no reference to this issue.  There has been little debate on this, which was interesting.  I agree with Deputy Eoghan Murphy that proper debate and accountability to those who elected us in our communities and consideration of the expectation of change in society could change a Member's decision and way of thinking and how or whether he or she votes on an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">The motion calls for the provision of legal advice to Members but the Government amendment is silent on this.  There is no argument against this and it has been referred to by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The system in the Chamber is archaic.  It is a reflection of what Fianna Fáil did over the past 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">We have oral questions, written questions, priority questions, questions on the Order of Business, questions on the Adjournment, questions to the Taoiseach and Leader's questions.  In general, very few of those questions get a real answer in the Dáil Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">There is a need for reform.  There is a big influx of new, first-time Deputies.  The question is whether we could bring a breath of fresh air into the Chamber, if we could bring experiences that are more relevant to the lives and attitudes of the ordinary people who elected us and who we know.  Could we bring in a new and more relevant way of conducting debate, scrutinising legislation and holding the Government to account?  That is what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The last paragraph of the Government amendment reads: "[The new Government] calls on parties and members in the Dáil to engage constructively with ongoing discussions on Dáil reform with the aim of implementing a package of reforms in the House from September".  The sentiment clashes sharply with the reality of the Government's response to the motion.  I am far from confident that any real change or reform will happen.  Real reform or change will stem from the point made by Deputy Healy about accountability to the electorate and how we are judged on the basis of what we said before the election and doing something different when we get into the Dáil Chamber.</p>

          <p eId="para_1348">We will have another battle like last year.  We need more than tokenism.  The debate follows on from the Second Stage of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill.  We saw from that the tokenism that is involved in some of the ways it was introduced.  The huge ideological difference between Fine Gael and Labour will be a problem for the Government.  We wish the parties well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The public voted for change.  They gave a huge majority to the parties that are now in Government.  People are not getting the change they sought.  Part of that demand came on the heels of the claims and accusations made on a daily basis by the spokespersons for Fine Gael and Labour.  As I said in other debates, they did not need to promise anything, they would have got in anyway.  Nonetheless, they promised much and have not delivered nor can they deliver.  It was known that they would be unable to deliver.  That is the political reality.  It leaves a sour taste in the mouths of the ordinary electorate, especially the young people who are educated and understand politics.  They want real debate and meaningful reform, as we all do.  The Taoiseach has said on many occasions and he reiterated this morning that he does not wish to be involved in a Punch and Judy show.  He accused Deputy Martin of engaging in a Punch and Judy show.  We must move beyond that and introduce real reform and accountability in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">Last night I saw the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, make announcements on the television news about water charges and property charges.  Those issues must be debated in the House.  He is a long-time practitioner of the political system and he understands it well.  I accept he also wants to see change.  We must get change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">The situation with legal advice was the same in county councils.  I accept there are legal advisers available but we do not get legal advice.  We are always told the Attorney General has advised the Government on this, that and the other.  I have experience of the Whip system from my previous term in the House.  On hearing that the Attorney General said we could not do such and such a thing I often asked whether we had sought a second opinion.  The Attorney General is only one legal mind.  I accept all legal experts are qualified but any day of the week one could hire three different, eminent senior counsel to give three different views on any given topic once one would come up with the readies to buy the advice.  I often wonder why the advice of the Attorney General must be accepted.  That was my experience on so many occasions during the term of the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">The members of the Technical Group were voted into the House in large numbers.  People voted for candidates not in the party system who hold a different view.  We have a mixed and varied grouping.  A combined effort allows the group to put forward motions such as this one, avail of speaking time and to do other things.  We can be different to each other and be honest and open and we do not have a Whip telling us what to do.  We are also entitled to research staff.  If the Government is honest about reform I do not know why we must wait until the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission decides whether we should get such staff when we are entitled to them as a right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">It is the same with Adjournment debates.  It is very difficult to raise a matter on the Adjournment.  We are allowed to raise matters under Standing Order 32 calling for the suspension of the Order of Business in the morning but having read out the matters the Ceann Comhairle rules them all out of order automatically.  The public wants change.  We must make the House accountable to the people on the street.  That is our primary duty and that is why we tabled the motion.  When it comes to the vote I hope the Government will accept the motion in the spirit in which it was tabled.</p>

        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_425">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1354">There should be a greater input at committee level on the drafting of legislation and people with expertise in all aspects of business, be it industry, agriculture, the economy, education, financial services or health should be integrated into the committees.  Such people could be selected from the public.  I appreciate that many Members of the Oireachtas have expertise in various sectors but we should include people with proven ability and knowledge at the initial committee level and following research and meaningful debate at that level we should proceed to debate in the parliamentary Chambers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">There should be more debate across the floor of the Dáil.  More thought should be given to good, practical proposals rather than the existing format which has been used in Parliament through the years.  It is a case of them and us.  There is much more co-operation between members at local government level.  Such a system works well if it is done in such a way that people accept the good points that are made from whatever quarter.  Much can be achieved from such an approach if good propositions are taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">Reference is made in the motion to meaningful local government reform.  That is an area with which I am more familiar.  Local authorities in their existing form exemplify local and democratic government at its best at a local level.  Evidence of that is provided in larger towns where there are efficient and capable town councils.  County councils have area offices in smaller towns where services are available for the public.  That is the most effective way of delivering services and accountability.  County councils have stood the test of time since 1899.  They are democratically elected every five years and they are accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Local development partnerships and RAPID programmes should be linked into local authorities and be synchronised with their work at local council level.  County enterprise boards are doing a reasonably good job.  It would maximise their results if they were even more integrated.  I would prefer a system whereby they would report back to county councils rather than the current arrangement of reporting back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  Many grants could also be administered at county council level, for example, social welfare protection grants and HSE grants.  Such work would be more cost effective and could be done more expeditiously by county councils.  Rent allowance should be transferred from the HSE to local authorities as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">Much adverse comment has focused on the representation levels in this country.  It is a proven fact that there are more public representatives in France and Switzerland than in this country.  We are below the EU average per head of population.  In Kerry South alone the population density is only a quarter of the EU average over a sprawling constituency.  Connectivity is important.  There is no point in comparing governments in Ireland and France or other European countries because they have a different tradition from ours.  Our product has worked well in the past, particularly in the area of tourism. Now, after the visit of President Obama, we should capitalise on that worldwide, particularly in the area of genealogy.</p>

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1359">I thank Deputies for their contributions over the past two evenings and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The motion and amendments are concerned with a range of important issues relating to the Oireachtas and other matters within the public expenditure and reform agenda.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, dealt with these and other matters relating to Government and the Legislature at national level.  I will deal briefly with the items that come within my direct area, namely electoral provisions and local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">As Minister with responsibility for local government and for overseeing a modern and efficient electoral system, reform and development are key aspects of the policy agenda I want to pursue.  I agree with Deputy Fleming that all ideas for policy implementation should be considered.  He made a number of practical suggestions that are important for the local government area, which are very much in keeping with my ideas regarding devolution of power from central to local government.  I am sorry Deputy Ross left the House because when he speaks about political change and reform, it is about himself.  As Fine Gael spokesman in opposition on this area not long ago, I spelled out radical ideas on how we could reform the Oireachtas and politics at local and national level.  The then Senator Ross opposed every one of those suggestions.  We cannot have it every way.  I put political reform on the national political agenda and I am determined, as is the Government, that much of that reform will be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">I take on board that there is significant change required in the way we operate in the House.  The Government is intent on making that change.  In terms of political reform, the Government is committed to delivering tangible results and that agenda has been placed at the heart of the Government programme.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 will provide for the implementation of a number of recent decisions announced by the Government.  First, as part of the agenda to make the political system leaner and more efficient for its citizens, the terms of reference for the constituency commission will result in a reduction in the number of Deputies.  The constituency convention, which will be established in the near future, will examine, among other issues, the question of whether we need a second House.  The constituency commission, which is due to be established upon the publication of the 2011 census results will report within three months of the publication of the final census results in 2012.  The Oireachtas will then have the opportunity to make the final legislative changes needed for implementation of these particular proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Second, considering the current economic climate and bearing in mind the prevailing mood for restraint in all aspects of public life, the Government has agreed to reduce the spending limits for the forthcoming presidential election and to reduce the amount that candidates can be reimbursed for expenses substantially.  Also, in order to ensure that citizens are fully represented in the Dáil and that vacancies will not be allowed to continue for an indeterminate time, the Government has agreed to an amendment to the electoral Acts which will guarantee that all by-elections are called within six months of a vacancy arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">Yesterday, I announced details of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011, which will be published in the coming weeks.  It will amend the electoral Acts to implement political funding commitments set out in the programme for Government.  Key elements include significant restrictions on corporate donations over €200 and reductions in the amounts of political donations that may be accepted as well as a lowering of the thresholds that can be declared.  We will also place a new condition on State funding of political parties.  If parties do not want to have their State funding halved, they must have at least 30% female and 30% male candidates at the next general election.  This will rise to 40% after seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">The Electoral Commission Bill is also part of the Government's legislative programme and it will be enacted during the lifetime of the Dáil. It contains a commitment to establish a commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department into one entity.  There is broad agreement on the principle that an electoral commission should be established.  Issues for consideration include international best practice; its structures and functions; who it will report to; its relationship with other bodies; and the approach to be followed with regard to the extensive legislation that will be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">The fundamental challenge for us all is to rebuild the economy and promote a fair and cohesive society.  This will be the foundation for a restoration of confidence in the political system at national and local level.  I am determined to devolve functions from central to local government, to make local government meaningful to citizens again and that people elected to local government will have a meaningful role and impact on the lives of those in local communities.  We have set out a programme of political reform which will overhaul the way politics, the Oireachtas and government work.  It is an ambitious programme, but it is required in order to modernise, renew and transform the way we do business here and in the political system generally.  The public needs to have faith in politics again and in the ability of Government, in all its forms, to deliver.  We are determined to deliver that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1368">In response to the Labour Party Deputies, who have left the Chamber, it is important to point out that the motion put forward by the Technical Group is not meant to be a comprehensive response to the urgent need for political or Dáil reform, because there are divergent views within the group on that matter.  We understand that there must be a real debate in society and between political parties and public representatives about how we make our system more democratic, responsive and participatory and in putting forward this motion, we wanted to prompt that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">The fundamental and radical change needed to democratise our society and make our political systems responsive to the needs and aspirations of the majority of the people goes way beyond Dáil reform and beyond tinkering around with its business.  It is about deep, fundamental change.  I want to speak about those deeper issues and the more fundamental change required.  However, we put forward some points about Dáil business, because we know change is imminent in that regard.  Change will happen because the Government has proposals on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">I support and welcome some of the proposed changes.  The abolition of the Seanad is long overdue.  The Government deserves credit for that proposal, although it was not the first to make it.  Fair play to the Government which intends to go through with the proposal, because as far as I am concerned the Seanad is a disgraceful, elitist institution.  The fact that only some people get to vote for a representative body and the majority does not makes it an institution that has nothing to do with democracy, one we must get rid of.  That proposal is positive.  However, whether what is left will be truly democratic or representative is something on which we need further discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">I also welcome the promise of whistleblower legislation and although we have yet to see the detail on that, it is a positive move.  I agree with Deputy Wallace and others that the Government proposal to introduce a system for parliamentary questions which will mean Deputies must be in the Chamber in order to have their questions accepted is a positive and long overdue change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">However, with regard to smaller and more technical issues, some of the Government proposals move in the opposite direction from making the Chamber more responsive and democratic.  Reducing questions to the Taoiseach to one slot a week, from the current two slots — which I believe used to be three — will reduce the exposure of the Taoiseach to public accountability.  That is wrong and regressive and the Government should ditch that proposal.  The suggestion put forward for topical debates is a good idea, but it is important these debates take place early in the day and that they are not shunted to late at night.  We also need to do something about the fiasco that is the Order of Business.  What needs to be done in that regard is not to remove the Taoiseach from that slot, but to open the slot up and regularise the <i>de facto</i> situation.  Deputies want to raise topical issues early in the day with the Leader of the Government.  They should have the right to do that and should not need to play games with the Ceann Comhairle based on an archaic mechanism of Order of Business which only seems to limit discussion.  I do not blame the Ceann Comhairle for that but there is an urgent need to regularise the <i>de facto</i> situation which is that people want to raise topical issues early in the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">These are technical details and even though I have made some proposals, as has the Government, the phrase rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i> comes to mind.  While I do not know who said it, he or she was right in saying that politics is concentrated economics.  The bottom line is that no matter how wonderful our democratic structures are, they mean nothing if people have no real power and control over the things that matter to them — their ability to get a job or a house, to have industry, to have economic and social development.  The problem is that in signing up to the IMF-EU deal, whatever tinkering we do with the political system is all irrelevant because the decisions on the things that really matter and that will affect the day-to-day lives of ordinary people have been handed over to a body that is completely unaccountable to the people of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">What is happening in Greece is terrifying.  It also relates to the issue of privatisation which the EU and IMF are pushing, on which I do not know the Government's attitude.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1376">I wish to make an elementary point that relates to the point Deputy Stagg made about quangos.  Quangos are unaccountable.  They are areas of public endeavour that are at one remove from public accountability through this Chamber.  Privatisation does that to an even greater degree.  It is about giving away land, resources, vital infrastructure, strategic industry, vitally important companies and so on, which belong to the public.  Therefore, through their public representatives members of the public have at least theoretically some influence over how those things are utilised in the interest of society as a whole or whatever.  Privatisation means the end of that.  It also means we are increasingly reduced to being a talking shop because it does not matter what we say as somebody else owns those things.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">In order to get a 1% reduction in its interest rate Greece has been told to sell the telecommunications and power infrastructure, and hospitals and the credit union system are to be privatised.  That is a systematic destruction of democracy.  If the EU and IMF are willing to do that to Greece, why should we think they want to do anything different to us?  Regardless of how much we get down on our knees and claim to be good boys in adhering to their programme, it is sinking our economy, yet they come back for more.  Even to get a small concession from them we have to promise to give away more of our public resources and in the process give away our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">Having a real and responsive democracy requires walking away from a deal that has handed over that democracy to forces that are completely unaccountable.  If public representatives were to be truly representative of the public, they should have wages and conditions commensurate with what ordinary people have to deal with.  Would we not be fighting much harder for the ordinary working people of the country if our economic situation was the same as theirs, which is what I propose?</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_432">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_1379">I believe we are all agreed that the people demanded political reform in the recent general election.  I recently saw a survey that showed that politicians were by far the least trusted professionals in Ireland — we are lower down the scale than lawyers by a large amount.  I commend the Government on some of its recent proposals.  If it manages to get through many of the things it proposes, there will be some genuine much needed reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">In particular I applaud the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on his proposal on female candidates in general elections.  That will be genuinely revolutionary.  I am delighted to see it and fully support it.  I suggest that a serious emphasis should be put on accountability in the Minister's proposals on local government.  If we are going to have local funding and devolution of power we need serious accountability which does not appear to be there at the moment.  I hope we see more of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">I also welcome the proposal in the Government's amendment for forthcoming legislation on whistleblowers, which is much needed in Irish society.  In particular I commend the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on their contributions yesterday.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, explicitly addressed the motion tabled by the Technical Group and agreed with many of the ideas therein, for which I thank him.  I note the passionate and convincing contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on how the balance of power between the Executive and the Dáil does not seem to be in a healthy place.  Rebalancing this is critical and I hope we will see some substantive moves in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">There has been considerable debate over the past two days on various aspects of reforming the Seanad, Dáil and local government.  I wish to concentrate this evening specifically on Dáil reform.  It is widely accepted in the political science community that Ireland has the most centralised power of any government in western Europe and it is widely accepted that this is not a good thing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, spoke eloquently on the subject yesterday.  I wish to make four observations as a new Deputy coming to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">There appears to be a lack of regulatory impact analysis.  There appears to be a lack of meaningful debate with Ministers on their proposed legislation.  We do not yet appear to have method for Government backbenchers or Opposition Members to interrogate Ministers on specific issues.  There is a blanket opposition through the party Whip system.  There appears to be a lack of transparency in Cabinet decision making.  I accept some of that is necessary but it seems to be quite extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Let me use the jobs initiative, which is extremely important, as an example.  I believe we would all accept that taking €1.8 billion out of pensions is a very serious thing to do.  Yet as a Member of the Dáil trying to represent the people of County Wicklow and east County Carlow and being asked to vote on the Bill, I have no information as to the projected benefits.</p>

          <p eId="para_1389">I will speed up.  The jobs initiative is a very good example of the present system not working.  We were being asked to vote on extremely important legislation for jobs creation which has potential impacts on the pensions industry yet we did not have anything like the information we needed in order to do that.  As we know the role of the Dáil is to hold the Cabinet to account as specified in Article 28.4.1° of the Constitution, which states: "The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann". We need to be provided with the tools to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">I welcome the Government's proposal to introduce a constitutional amendment on compulsory powers for committees and hopefully to introduce meaningful questions for Ministers on proposed legislation.  I have no ideological objection to political parties and I understand that the Whip may be necessary at times.  I commend Deputy Eoghan Murphy on the call for greater use of free votes.  This is done in other democracies and is seen as a good thing allowing Government backbenchers to use their expertise and represent the people who elected them.  The Government backbenches are full of talented people with good ideas and a passion to get things done.  It must be extremely frustrating not to be able to hold the Government to account in a meaningful way and essentially to be forced to vote with the Cabinet every time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">We need to address the culture as well as the rules.  While I commend the Government on much of what it is proposing, I wish to make three observations on the question of culture.  With regard to committees, it appears on this side of the House as if we are being handed a <i>fait accompli</i> with very little input in terms of the number of committees, what they will do and the representation thereon.  The Government has over-represented itself on the committees relative to the number of Deputies in the Dáil.  That concerns me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">Deputy Stagg's recent and rather insidious contribution to the debate would be fine and we could dismiss him as a fossil of a bygone era if he were not the Labour Party's Whip.  He is the Labour Party's person appointed to engage with the Opposition on issues of reform.  When the person appointed in this capacity speaks with such contempt and disrespect for a genuine motion tabled by this side of the House on meaningful political reform, it suggests the old culture is alive and well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">The start of the motion, referenced by the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, states our democracy needs to be effective, accountable, transparent, representative and participatory.  We probably all agree that we fail, to a greater or lesser degree, on all five of those criteria at present.  There has been fantastic debate this evening and yesterday on this motion and genuine passion for change was expressed by very many Members.  If we can change the rules and the culture of the House, there may be hope for us and for democracy in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
            <p eId="para_1526">A parliamentary question I asked of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, on 25 May uncovered two rather startling pieces of information.  First, the value of off-the-road vehicle declarations for the 15 month period between May 2009 to July 2010 was over €94 million.  This would equate to roughly €76 million per annum.  Off-the-road vehicle declarations occur where the owner of a vehicle makes a statement, verified by the Garda, that the vehicle was not driven on the road for a period of time.  Given the approximate €76 million per annum value, a substantial number of vehicles are being declared as off-the-road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">According to a report produced by the Dublin Motor Tax Office, 27% of the total number of vehicles registered in Monaghan in 2008 were declared off road for part of that year.  The figure for the Dublin area was about 12%.  In the motor tax office in Nutgrove, County Dublin, over 12,000 vehicles were declared as being off the road for part of the year in 2008.  The figure for County Galway in the same period was 22,500.  It is hard to credit that all these were genuine cases of vehicles being off the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">Second, an off-the-road declaration for any month can only be accepted after that month has ended.  This surely makes it possible to say that a vehicle has been off the road when it might not have been so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">I call on the Minister to do three things.  First, he must take steps to review the procedure as soon as possible.  I understand from the answer to a parliamentary question that he intends to do so.  Second, he must introduce a better system, such as that which operates in Switzerland.  In that country, when a vehicle is declared off the road, the tax disc is returned to the local authority for the period the vehicle is off the road.  Third, if extra revenue comes in as a result of the reform, the benefit should be passed on to compliant motor tax payers in the form of lower motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">One reason I raise this issue is because local authorities receive the money collected from motor tax through the local government fund.  With streams of finance to local authorities in serious decline, it is important that levels of motor tax income are maintained.  For example, my county of South Dublin, which includes Lucan, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Templeogue, has a population of about 250,000 and it received €24.29 million in 2010.  The current yearly rate of motor tax being lost would fund three such councils, so I would appreciate it if the Minister addressed those issues.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1531">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I am very concerned at the high level of off-the-road declarations being made.  I am aware that current procedures governing the making of such declarations may be open to abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">Off-the-road declarations are made retrospectively to cover short periods, usually of a month, where motor tax was unpaid as the vehicle to which the declaration applies was not in use in a public place during the period to which the declaration refers.  The current system allows for such a declaration to be witnessed by a member of the Garda Síochána.  This was intended to discourage false declarations.  However, it may be considered to be ineffective as the garda may be witnessing the signature on the declaration only and may not be in a position to verify whether the vehicle was in use on the road for the period in question.  It could thus be argued that this process, designed to facilitate genuine cases where vehicles are not in use on a public road, is capable of being used to evade the payment of motor tax for short periods by making false declarations in instances where vehicles may have been used in a public place during the period of the declaration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">It is my strong view that this practice is exacerbated by the custom and practice of allowing a month's grace for the payment of motor tax.  While this is not laid down in law, the approach has arisen from the period when renewing tax discs could be slow and time-consuming.  This is no longer the case since the introduction of the online motor tax system.  However, the common perception that this one month grace period exists probably feeds into the notion that driving without valid motor tax for short periods is acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">The most recent verified figures available indicate that the value of off-the-road declarations made during the 15 months from May 2009 to July 2010, inclusive, was over €94 million.  I have asked my Department, in the context of a general revision of motor tax law, to take steps this year to address the procedures in this area.  While acknowledging that it will not be possible to remove off-the-road declarations completely, a system somewhat akin to that in use in the UK is being considered in the context of the development of a motor tax Bill, whereby off-the-road declarations will be possible only in advance for a specified period of no less than three months.  It will not be possible for retrospective applications to be made, as these are in essence unlikely to be fully verifiable.  I also propose to confirm the non-existence in law of the month's grace period to renew motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">More generally, the motor tax Bill will consolidate and modernise motor tax law, and reform the administration of the motor tax system to ensure consistency, resource efficiency and best customer practice in service delivery.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1536">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  The specific issue I wish to raise is that of higher level mathematics in the leaving certificate.  Mathematics is a very important subject for the leaving certificate.  In fact, it is one of the most important subjects in our economy.  I met people recently who work in an industry where mathematics is very important and they are concerned with the standards of mathematics and science in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">I put down a parliamentary question recently because I wanted to find out how many students study higher level mathematics for the leaving certificate and how many end up sitting the exam.  I discovered that 10,516 students studied it in 2010, but only 8,390 actually sat the exam, so more than 2,000 students opted not to sit it.  I wanted to explore why this might be the case, and I discovered that if a student fails mathematics in the leaving certificate, then many courses are closed to that student at third level.  I spoke to some students and they told me this is one of the main reasons they decided not to take the examination.  If they failed higher level mathematics, then they could not go to college.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">There are some exceptions to this.  Waterford Institute of Technology has a safety net and allows students who fail honours mathematics to do another mathematics exam to qualify.  Perhaps we should look at this.  Higher level mathematics can take up 25% of a pupil's study time, so if an 18 or 19 old studying higher level mathematics decides not to do the exam and drops down to the lower level, then he or she will probably get an A grade.  However, this means that the drive to take on higher level mathematics is being diluted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">Perhaps we should look at a second chance, as is currently happening in WIT, so that any student who fails the exam could have the opportunity of doing it again.  These students would be well capable of meeting the minimum requirements — a C3 at lower level — to get into most courses.  If they fail the higher level exam they get nothing and must repeat the whole year.  That is very unfair and many students are not prepared to take that risk.  Can we blame them?</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">The Minister will talk about the bonus points for higher level mathematics and I know that there are other issues that Professor Kathleen Lynch has raised in respect of inequality, but that is another matter.  Bonus points will not make a difference if the student fails.  They might act as an incentive to do well, but if the student fails then he or she is precluded from many courses.  If a safety net existed, most students would take the risk of doing the exam, knowing that if they failed it, they could repeat it in the autumn somewhere to get the minimum requirement that would entitle them to take the third level course.  It is a small thing, but I know from talking to students and teachers that it is a big issue for many of them.  It is often the reason students decide not to take the higher level course in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">I am interested in what the Minister has to say.  He may not have picked up in his script all the points that I made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">Maths is a very important subject and we need to encourage students to opt for it in every way we can.  Bonus points alone are not enough.  We need to do more.  I ask the Department to consider my views in this regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_441" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_1543">I apologise for the inability of the Minister for Education and Skills to be here; he has asked me to take this matter for him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">Ireland's future economic growth and competitiveness will increasingly depend on the extent to which it can support high-value, knowledge-based industries.  Mathematics is essential for disciplines such as science, technology, engineering and finance, but it also promotes the ability to think rationally, analyse and solve problems, and process data clearly and accurately.  In a competitive global economy, it is important that Ireland moves towards the promotion of advanced levels of skills, creativity and innovation.  We urgently need to improve attainment levels in mathematics generally and encourage more students to take higher level mathematics.  Mathematics is an essential life skill for citizenship and for economic and social participation in an increasingly complex world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">A total of 16% of students sat higher level mathematics in the 2010 leaving certificate examination.  This is down from a high of 18.9% in 2005, and is significantly out of line with participation at higher level in other subjects.  For example, 33% of students sat higher level Irish, a subject in which students can also choose from three levels, and 64% sat higher level English, which has two levels.  As well as those who sat higher level mathematics in the 2010 leaving certificate examination, 11.5% of students sat foundation level and 72.5% sat ordinary level.  A further issue is that some 20% of students who initially applied to sit mathematics at higher level in the leaving certificate in 2010 did not take the examination at that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">A range of factors are behind students' decisions not to take mathematics at higher level for senior cycle.  Undoubtedly, workload, fear of not meeting matriculation requirements and the points race are significant factors for many.  Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate a bonus points system for higher level mathematics for a four-year trial period from 2012 to 2015, inclusive, with a review in 2014.  A bonus of 25 points will be allocated to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in leaving certificate higher level mathematics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">With regard to mathematics at junior certificate level, I expect to receive advice shortly from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on a framework for a significantly reformed junior cycle which will improve students' learning experiences, address curriculum overload, and promote creativity, innovation and learning to learn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">A major programme of reform in mathematics, Project Maths, began in all second level schools at both junior and senior cycle in September last, building on the experience of 24 schools which began the programme in 2008.  Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system.  The initial experience in the 24 Project Maths schools in which students sat the leaving certificate in 2010 indicated a modest increase in the proportion who sat mathematics at higher level — 18.7% compared with 16.0% nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">The Department intends to publish shortly a national literacy and numeracy strategy which will provide a continuum of measures designed to improve performance in these critical areas.  It is in our primary schools and in the early years that the foundations of learning are laid.  The strategy will emphasise the key role of parents, early education settings and primary schools in supporting numeracy.  Taken together, these initiatives are intended to improve attainment in mathematics and increase the numbers of students taking the higher level paper in order to better meet the needs of our economy and society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">I will consider the suggestions that have been made by Deputy Stanton on second-chance opportunities for students who have not been successful in mathematics in previous examinations, and I will convey them to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_1551">I welcome the opportunity to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to give consideration to a plea from a group of farmers in the east Clare area to retain the Teagasc office as a service provider in the town of Scarriff.  As Deputies know, there are proposals, decided on in light of budgetary requirements, to close a number of Teagasc offices across the country.  While we must all take into account value for money and the lesser availability of funds to provide for various services, there is a strong case to be made for Scarriff in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The office serves about 1,000 client farmers in the south Galway-east Clare area.  Clare and Galway are seen as an administrative area and quite a number of farmers from the east and south Galway area, with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar, use the services at Scarriff.  The proposal by the board of Teagasc is that services to those farmers now be provided in the town of Ennis, almost 50 km away.  It makes no economic sense.  The proposal to close the office in Scarriff and relocate the office to Ennis will not result in any saving either from a capital or from a revenue point of view.  The four Teagasc advisers will remain on the staff as they will be required to meet the needs of the farmers in the area, and there will be additional costs associated with their expenses and the loss of time resulting from their having to come from an office over 40 km away to serve that farmer base.  It does not make economic sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">The proposal is to sell the building, which is fine, but in the long term there will be an increase in costs.  The capital side of the programme will require the building of an extension at the office in Ennis at considerable cost to the State.  Taking all the factors into account, there is no logical reason the Scarriff office in particular should be closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">I am appealing to the Minister to make a special case to the board and the executive of Teagasc to re-evaluate the facts with regard to the Scarriff office.  It is a unique situation because of the distance involved and the economics.  The cost of running the office at the moment is relatively low and it generates considerable income not just from the farming community, but also from other potential uses of the office in the evening.  I believe we should facilitate the retention of this office in the heart of a rural area.  The east Clare office has been the central office for the provision of hen harrier advice because of the hen harrier designation that exists there and its removal would be a loss to the region.  I am appealing to the Minister in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">There needs to be a complete review of the Teagasc strategy, particularly in light of the proposals in Harvest 2020 and the necessity of ensuring the utilisation of land is at a maximum to enable us to meet the output required.  If we do not have advisers working hand-in-hand with farmers on the ground, we will not reach those targets.  Teagasc must rethink its entire strategy, which, as the Minister of State knows, has been moving back into research and away from the provision of advisory services on the ground.  That is a retrograde step.  The current economic situation and our greater dependence on our export sector, particularly food exports, should be food for thought — if Deputies will pardon the pun — for the board of Teagasc, which I hope will result in a complete re-evaluation of its strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">The argument for the retention of the service at Scarriff stands on its own merits on the basis of the cost savings.  Cost was the original reason given for the closure of the office, but when one goes through the information in detail one can see there is clearly no justification for it.  I appeal to the Minister to reflect on this and seek the assistance of the board of Teagasc in reversing that decision.</p>

          <speech by="#ShaneMcEntee" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_443">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Shane McEntee)</from>
            <p eId="para_1557">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  With regard to the last part of his contribution, I understand the importance of having a proper advisory service in view of the approach of the 2020 targets.  It is important for anybody going into agriculture, or already in agriculture, that the best advice possible is available.  Since we came into government, we have had representations about many Teagasc offices that have been closed down.  I cannot comment on decisions made by Teagasc, but one wonders whether some of these closures were in the right areas.  However, that is a decision for Teagasc.  I cannot honestly say how it will be reviewed, but I will consider what the Deputy has said and pass it on to the Minister.  I do not know whether the door is closed, but I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988 to provide integrated research, advisory and training services to the agriculture and food industry.  The organisation's mission is to support science-based innovation in the agrifood sector and wider bio-economy so as to underpin profitability, competitiveness and sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">It is the main agency responsible for delivering the Government's objectives on innovation and the knowledge economy as far as the agrifood sector is concerned.  Its programmes and services are critical in enabling the sector take full advantage of the many opportunities in global markets.  Delivery of these programmes and services is an operational matter for Teagasc and its board.  Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act establishing Teagasc and is not concerned with the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Each year, Teagasc receives substantial Exchequer resources to fund the delivery of first class training, research and advisory services.  The allocation for the current year is €132 million.  This is very substantial funding by any standards and a firm indication of the Government's ongoing commitment to Teagasc activities.  Prioritisation of funding for particular services is a matter for Teagasc management to determine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">Teagasc commenced a change process in mid-2008 in order to ensure it remains fit for purpose and delivers value for public money.  The Teagasc Change Programme 2009-2013 addresses both the ongoing need for change and the need for significant resource rationalisation.  Implementation is resulting in the disposal of surplus assets, a significant reduction in the number of research, advisory and educational locations, the cutting of management and administrative posts and significant productivity gains by staff.  On completion, the future Teagasc will be a smaller, highly innovative, efficient and focused organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">I understand that as part of the change programme, Teagasc has decided to concentrate the delivery of its services, including advisory services, at fewer centres.  The existing network of advisory offices will be streamlined from 91 to 51 by the end of 2012.  The specific criteria used by Teagasc in assessing the viability of advisory office locations included client numbers, staff numbers, distance to clients, distance to other Teagasc offices and overall cost structure.  The decision to close these offices and concentrate the delivery of services at fewer locations is entirely a matter for Teagasc and its board.  It should be noted that on average clients visit an advisory office 1.5 times per year.  Farmers tend to gravitate much more readily to other public events such as seminars, farm walks, demonstrations and information meetings.  A good example is the discussion group model where groups of farmers visit similar farms and share information and experiences in dialogue facilitated by their Teagasc adviser.  I must state this is very successful and it is the way forward in all aspects of farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The Scariff office is one of 40 which the Teagasc board has decided to close under the change programme.  Despite the closure, Teagasc is committed to maintaining a high quality service to its farmer clients in County Clare.  They will continue to have access to the best possible advice delivered by highly skilled advisory staff based at Teagasc's remaining offices in Ennis and Kilrush.  I understand that Teagasc is investing €200,000 to renovate and extend the advisory office in Ennis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The Teagasc authority has stressed that when the rationalisation programme is implemented it will still have a significant network of advisory offices, research centres and training colleges located throughout the country.  Therefore, the ability of Teagasc to provide its range of services will not be diminished.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">In three months, 102 people from Dundalk will be out of work.  The announcement was made last Friday by the Vodafone company.  Of the 102 people, 82 work for Rigney Dolphin which provides services to Vodafone, while the remaining 20 work directly for Vodafone.  The people affected had a very miserable weekend.  Many of them are very highly qualified and have contributed to the success of Vodafone in this country.  Now they face a choice between emigration and the dole queue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">I offer my sympathy to all of the individuals affected by this decision, and to their families.  I implore the Minister of State to pull out all the stops on their behalf.  Vodafone is a very profitable business and will probably save money by moving some of its services to India and Egypt.  While the money saved can be measured, how does one measure the suffering inflicted on the people who will lose their jobs?  Recently, the new Government halved the lower rate of PRSI in an effort to reduce the cost of employing people.  This will definitely help Vodafone's cost base.  The Government also intends to make every effort to reduce costs for employers through every means open to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">Will the Minister of State engage with Vodafone to explain the Government's strategy and ask it to reverse its decision?  The Republic is in dire straits and a little loyalty from Vodafone to the 102 people who have contributed to its profits would be very well received.  As a last resort, I urge the Minister of State to establish a taskforce to replace these jobs in Dundalk as a matter of urgency.  Dundalk is only a few miles from the Border.  The local economy suffered greatly during the IRA campaign and has always been a victim of competition from across the Border.  Dundalk cannot afford to lose 102 jobs.</p>

This comes at a time when 443,400 citizens are unemployed.  Clearly, Vodafone has no loyalty to Irish people.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether Vodafone has received public funds and tax exemptions.  Since it came here, Vodafone's profits have amounted to €2.2 billion with profits last year of €120 million.  Vodafone takes public monies, makes huge profits and then moves on.  This is the unacceptable face of globalisation and the Government must review this type of operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">I met representatives of the Communications Workers' Union and if the Minister of State has not met them I ask him to do so.  Their briefing included the minutes of a meeting with Vodafone.  The union asked what will happen to workers losing jobs in Rigney Dolphin, which supplies employees to Vodafone, and whether they would be redeployed to Vodafone.  It was told "No".  It asked what will be the terms of redundancy for the employees.  It was told this had nothing to do with Vodafone but was a matter for Rigney Dolphin.  It asked whether Vodafone accepts it has a responsibility to Rigney Dolphin employees working in Vodafone and was told Vodafone has responsibility only to the business contract between Rigney Dolphin and Vodafone.  The union requested that Vodafone postpone the decision to sack these citizens to enable all parties to engage in discussions with a view to finding alternatives that will save jobs and was told "No".  It asked whether Vodafone can guarantee that further jobs or work will not be outsourced and was told "No".  The union asked what were the cost savings involved in the jobs going offshore and was told Vodafone did not know.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">This is not acceptable.  The Government needs to ensure that as many of these jobs as possible are protected and that any workers who lose their jobs receive their redundancy entitlement.  This needs a decisive, clear and effective response from the Government and it needs it now.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_1570">I wish to sympathise with the workers and their families.  This decision was taken by Vodafone and it raises some questions which have been clearly and well articulated by the Deputies.  I will not refer to my script because I honestly believe that serious questions have been raised, including the relationship with Vodafone which is a very profitable company.  When the issues were raised by the Deputies, Vodafone supplied the Department with some information which would not necessarily have answered the questions put.  With this in mind, I ask the Deputies to allow me some leeway so I can interact with Vodafone's public affairs section, and with Enterprise Ireland because I understand Rigney Dolphin is a client company, and so that we can examine the exact reasons the outsourcing has begun.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">According to a document received from Vodafone, it is expected that at the conclusion of the consultation process the credit and collections activity will be outsourced to a specialist supplier in Ireland.  Mobile data and customer operations will transfer to an existing group subsidiary based in Egypt and mobile back office will transfer to a subsidiary company based in India.  I also understand that Ireland is not the only country affected by the Vodafone move.  The group also moved call centre operations from Germany to Egypt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Rather than give the Deputies a <i>pro forma </i>answer, I ask them to allow me some leeway.  Deputy Adams referred to the Communication Workers’ Union and if it has been in touch with him, I would be more than happy to field a telephone call from it on this matter.  I cannot give any guarantees as it was a corporate decision.  All I can say is that we are committed to trying to retain jobs.  The State agencies in this region as well as the Louth County Enterprise Board will continue to promote Dundalk as a centre for inward investment and enterprise development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">I acknowledge the Deputies have raised some interesting points.  Vodafone employs 1,200 staff in various locations in Ireland which is a significant investment in this country and that must be acknowledged.  However, questions have been raised this evening and perhaps this merits further examination.  I would be happy to oblige the Deputies in so far as I am able to do so and I will endeavour to help them in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">Terms of reference and the overall approach to the forthcoming review of the taxi sector are close to finalisation and will be announced shortly. The review will be undertaken in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The review will enable necessary further qualitative reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced. The review will allow for consultation with all stakeholders — despatch operators, drivers, consumers as well as regulatory and enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">The review will also focus on issues of compliance and enforcement, including the disturbing practices highlighted in the recent RTÉ "Prime Time Investigates" Programme.  I envisage that the review will report within a period of 4 months on a recommended speedy programme of action to include any changes that may be appropriate to legislation, regulatory policies and practices and enforcement arrangements and deployment of resources.  Following appropriate consideration of the review recommendations I will, of course, seek early Government  approval of its necessary implementation including legislative changes that may be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">I have had recent contact with various taxi representative bodies about their concerns and my proposed approach to the review. I will have full regard to the views conveyed to me in shaping  the scope and approach to the review. One subject that I expect the review to consider will be how discussion between regulatory authorities and taxi providers can best be facilitated in future, taking account of the existing role and structure of the statutory Taxi Advisory Committee.</p>

I understand from the Authority that over €33 million was spent on bus lanes and related technology projects in 2010 - this funded the completion of 15 separate projects and 6.1km of bus lane as well as ongoing work on many other projects and bus lanes.  In 2011, the NTA has allocated over €20 million of its overall budget to bus related projects - it is expected that 12 projects and 12.1km of new bus lane will be completed this year.  I will ask the NTA to provide the Deputy with its detailed programme of work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1596">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 61 and 69 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">I am sure that the Deputies will be aware that the total allocation currently available for the Regional Airports Programme for 2011 is €13.4m (almost all of which is already committed) compared to expenditure of €21.2m on the Programme in 2010.  This reduction was made by the previous Government and I am now faced with dealing with the lack of funding available for the the regional airports in 2011 and future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">The Value for Money (VFM) Review published by the previous Government in January 2011 recommended that funding for PSO air services between Dublin and the regional airports be discontinued when current contracts end in July 2011, except for the Donegal/Dublin service, and that operational (OPEX) and capital expenditure funding (CAPEX) be discontinued for Sligo and Galway airports.  These recommendations took into account changes in EU legislation, airport performances, the substantial investment in surface transport, overlapping catchment areas, the best use of scarce Exchequer resources and the implications for the tourism and business sectors in the regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">The Western Development Commission met with my Department in early and mid-2010 in relation to its submission and I understand that the views of the Commission were conveyed to my predecessor prior to publication of the VFM Review and the decision taken by the previous Government subsequently to continue with PSO air services on the Donegal/Dublin and Kerry Dublin routes only after July 2011.  In addressing the lack of funding issue, I have to take into consideration developments in recent years as highlighted in the Review and the need to focus on ensuring the sustainability of a strong network of regional airports serving the Irish public, both in terms of business and tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">No decision on the funding for regional airport for 2011 and future years has yet been made by the current Government.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of the Government's deliberations.  However, it is clear that in the current difficult climate, any decisions will have to take account of available Exchequer funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">In relation to regional links to international airports, I understand that the tourism agencies are working with the regional airports in the promotion of inbound tourists to the regions.  This assistance is part of the three-pronged strategy included in the recent Jobs Initiative to encourage inbound tourism to the island of Ireland from key source markets.  The other two elements of the strategy relate to the proposed abolition of the €3 travel tax and the new growth incentive scheme recently introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority.  I have already dealt with this matter in response to Priority Question No. 1.</p>

The Deloitte Report on the cost and efficiency of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, published in 2009,  found that while such grants and subsidies to comparable bus operations in other European countries varied greatly, levels of operational subvention were generally higher than that to Dublin Bus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">The Deloitte report also identified significant scope for the redesign and more efficient operation of the Dublin Bus network to provide a more attractive service to existing and potential users.  The redesign would achieve more frequent, streamlined and reliable services. Following the publication of that Report, Dublin Bus undertook an extensive review of their bus network and announced plans for the re-organisation of routes and timetables.  Notwithstanding the enhanced service provided by Dublin Bus as a result of Network Direct, the company must implement further cost saving measures to reduce the level of operating losses in recent years. In the current fiscal environment continuous efficiency in the provision of PSO services will be my priority, as increased exchequer support is not a realistic objective at present.</p>

Following that, the Government will draw up a new National Development Plan that reflects Ireland's changed economic circumstances, covering the seven year period 2012-2019. The longer term transport priorities of the Government will be determined by this process.

            <p eId="para_1634">There is no doubt that, like other export sectors, the tourism industry faces many challenges, in particular the economic difficulties in our key source markets and contractions in international air access.  Notwithstanding these challenges, the Government has recognised that tourism has the potential to be a key driver of economic recovery and that is why it has placed such emphasis on tourism in the Programme for Government and the recent Jobs Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">In the Jobs Initiative, the Government announced that it will reduce the level of VAT applied to a range of labour-intensive tourism services to 9%, providing a much needed support and a competitive boost to tourism.  The Government has also taken steps to promote inward bound tourism through</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1636">abolishing the travel tax conditional on clear commitments by airlines to increase inbound capacity from our source markets;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1637">the offer by the Dublin Airport Authority of significant rebates on passenger charges for extra passengers brought in by airlines; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1638">more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, DAA and the airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">A number of initiatives have also been taken to promote domestic tourism including</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1640">a €1m Discover Ireland Summer promotional campaign;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1641">special fares promotions from Irish Rail;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1642">making available 750,000 Discover Ireland guides with special offers for home holidays as well as a revamped Discover Ireland website and other technology initiatives such as a smartphone app.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">In addition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought in Ireland's first formal Visa Waiver Programme that will facilitate and encourage tourism to Ireland from key emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Central Statistics Office recently released tourism figures for the first three months of 2011 which show the first increase in three years in overseas visitors to Ireland.  Overseas visitors to Ireland increased by 8.6% compared to the same period in 2010.  In particular, there is good news from our most important market, Great Britain, which showed an increase of 7.2% as well as North America which is up by almost 12%.  I am hopeful that growth will continue for the rest of the year.  The highly successful visits of Queen Elizabeth II and US President Barack Obama were broadcast around the world.  I do not think any advertising campaign could compare with these positive images and the State tourism agencies will be working hard to capitalise on this positive exposure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1646">There are no such plans at present.  The recession has inevitably had a negative impact on all the State port companies, although the impact has not been spread evenly among them.  The continuing trend toward larger ships has also affected the level of business at some ports. However, the circumstances in each port are quite different and need to be dealt with on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">It is my intention to publish a revised ports policy document later this year, which will provide a reference point for future decisions in relation to individual ports. The policy document will follow up on a public consultation that took place last year. A key policy issue raised in the consultation is the current structure of the sector, whereby the State owns ten separate port companies of very varied size.  The recent McCarthy Group Report recommended that the number of port companies be reduced through amalgamations. However, the merging of smaller port companies with larger ones is certainly not the only option available. These wider policy issues will be addressed in the revised policy document.</p>

            <p eId="para_1672">The promotion of Ireland as a holiday destination in specific markets, including the countries mentioned, and decisions on budgets allocated for specific markets are operational matters for Tourism Ireland.  I have referred the Deputy's Question to the agency for direct reply in this regard.  The Deputy should advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within ten working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">On the broader tourism policy side, the Government's Jobs initiative includes several measures specifically aimed at assisting the tourism sector. These include the three-pronged strategy to encourage carriers to restore access, covering the Air Travel Tax, airport charges and targeted cooperative marketing to drive business on new routes from key tourism source markets. Also included is the reduction of VAT from 13.5% to 9% on the costs of certain services,  including restaurant, accommodation and admission charges to tourist attractions, which will help attract tourists from all markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Of particular interest for some of the long haul developing markets is the introduction of the Visa Waiver Programme on a pilot basis from July 2011 to October 2012. This measure will allow tourists from certain countries who are in possession of a valid UK visa and who have already entered the UK to have that visa recognised by Ireland as sufficient for lawful entry into the State at no additional cost. The countries covered by the planned Visa Waiver Scheme include the Russian Federation, China and India; Brazil is currently visa-exempt.  This imaginative measure will encourage visitors to Great Britain to extend their trips without the cost and inconvenience of applying for an Irish visa.  I expect the tourism agencies to make the most of this opportunity this year and, particularly in 2012, to encourage people from these markets to come to Ireland and experience our hospitality for the first time in conjunction with the London Olympics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">These are just some of the measures aimed at ensuring that Ireland benefits from tourists from new and developing long haul markets. I look forward to working with the tourism agencies and other Departments in the months ahead to come up with further innovative ideas to ensure that we grow our market share from these markets.</p>

The figures are published on an annual basis in September of each year, so the next publication in September 2011 will cover the period April 2010 to April 2011. Because of the underlying seasonality and variability of all migration flows the CSO does not publish the data on a sub-annual basis. The estimates will be assessed and subject to review once the definitive results of the five yearly census are made available in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1689">The report of the UN Fact Finding Mission into the Gaza conflict, or the Goldstone Report, was published in September 2009 and was widely welcomed as a serious and authoritative investigation of events during that conflict, and an attempt to bring greater accountability for this conflict. This view has been strongly supported by Ireland at EU and UN levels. Despite some recent debate following the publication of an article by Judge Goldstone, I believe that the report continues to impress as a sober, painstaking and sincere investigation of events which were complex and violent, and in relation to which it was, and remains, very difficult to achieve clarity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">The Human Rights Council, taking into account what the parties have done thus far in terms of domestic investigations and accountability, followed up on these issues in its Resolution of 25 March 2011 which, <i>inter alia</i>  , referred the matter to the UN General Assembly for further consideration. In discussions on this Resolution within the EU group in Geneva, Ireland (which is not a member of the HRC) argued for a generally positive view of the text, although there were elements of it which were problematic for some partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">The UN General Assembly will now consider how to take this matter forward, including any suggestions of involving other bodies in the UN system. Ireland has twice voted in favour of the General Assembly Resolution on this issue. We continue to regard the Fact Finding Mission Report as a serious and unimpugned document which merits serious follow-up.  Whether we can again vote in favour of a Resolution on those issues — as I would hope — will of course depend on the precise terms of such a Resolution and our assessment of the sincerity of its proposers. We will not give our support to States or Resolutions which are more interested in making capital out of this issue than in moving it forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1693">The Government has engaged with European matters actively since coming to office.  This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to restoring Ireland's standing as a respected and influential member of the European Union.  It implies the need for a broad effort, across government and administration, of engagement with EU institutions and with EU partners bilaterally, as well as with our international partners. Relations with the European Commission are central to this.   At Government level, Ministers have been availing of opportunities to meet their EU colleagues and with representatives of the European institutions, including the European Commission. These efforts continue and will be a regular feature of our interaction with the various EU institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">I would recall that, within days of taking office, the Taoiseach travelled to Brussels to attend an Extraordinary meeting of the European Council and an informal meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area. He took the opportunity on that occasion of meeting Commission President Barroso.  I have availed of meetings of EU Foreign Ministers to meet High Representative Ashton, who is a Vice President of the European Commission. I had the opportunity of speaking to the Secretary General of the Commission, Catherine Day, during her recent visit to Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">On 19th April last I invited EU Ambassadors to Iveagh House to set out the Government's analysis of the economic situation facing the country, seek the understanding and support of partners for our course, and also to underline the desire of the Government to engage constructively and more widely on the range of issues on the European agenda. All resident embassies were represented, as well as the heads of the European Commission and European Parliament offices.  My colleague, Minister of State Creighton has availed of visits to Brussels and Luxembourg to meet representatives of the institutions including Commissioner Geoghegan Quinn. As the Deputy will recall, Commissioner Geoghegan Quinn addressed this House on 9th May as part of our Europe Day celebrations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">The first meeting abroad which I attended since taking up the role of Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting in Gödöllo in Hungary on 11-12 March. The candidate countries attended for part of these discussions and the occasion was a welcome opportunity to meet a number from that group which comprises Turkey, Iceland, Croatia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">The Council last debated the overall situation on enlargement in December 2010 and adopted conclusions, endorsed by the European Council, which guide the continuing work in this area and with which I am in full agreement. The most recent discussion on an individual accession process was at the General Affairs Council on 23 May attended by Minister of State Creighton. The discussion was informal and focussed on the few remaining open areas in the Croatian negotiations. Some work remains to be done, in light of a Commission assessment, but the process has made very substantial progress. The European Council in June is expected to consider Croatia's accession process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">My approach, and this Government's approach, to EU enlargement is a positive one. In addition to being a beneficiary of a previous enlargement ourselves, we have seen how the enlargements of recent years have secured democracy and stability in Europe in addition to bolstering trade and promoting prosperity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Membership of the Union continues to be something to which many of the EU's neighbours aspire. The prospect of membership encourages candidate countries to achieve economic and political reforms and to strengthen their democratic values. However, the very stability and prosperity which attract others can only be maintained by ensuring an accession process for prospective members which applies strict conditionality and criteria. Accession to the EU requires challenging reforms and great political commitment.  These are necessary to ensure that the credibility of the process is protected.  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to play an active role in discussions on the issue, both at Council meetings and in bilateral discussions with existing and aspirant member states.</p>

In the context of engaging with debtors through the business plans that they must submit to NAMA, the agency encourages sustainable commercial activity by debtors.  I would expect, therefore, that if a sporting or other organisation wishes to enter into a leasing arrangement with a debtor, the two parties would reach an appropriate commercial arrangement of mutual benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">NAMA has, in the first place, acquired loans and it advises me that property or other assets securing these loans remain in the possession of debtors unless it takes enforcement action against them. Where enforcement action is taken by NAMA, the agency may ultimately take ownership of property but it is expected that in the majority of these instances the property will be managed by a receiver who is the agent of the debtor but who acts in accordance with NAMA's instructions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">I am informed that, under an initiative currently in preparation, NAMA will shortly include on its website a database of properties which are under the control of receivers appointed to enforce against NAMA debtors (appointed either directly by NAMA or by participating institutions working on its behalf). This will provide a single source of information on NAMA assets which are for sale and it will be updated on a very regular basis. It is expected to be up-and-running within a matter of weeks.</p>

Budget  2011 introduced transitional arrangements to be applied where, as a result of these changes, a taxpayer was disadvantaged compared to the stamp duty treatment applicable prior to 8 December 2010. However, the transitional arrangements can be applied only where a binding contract had been entered into prior to 8 December 2010 and where the instrument is executed on or after 8 December 2010 but before 1 July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, on the basis of the facts supplied in this case, that a binding contract was not in place until 13 December 2010 which is the date by which it was signed by all parties and therefore, the contract date.  As a binding contract was not in place prior to the 8 December 2010, the transitional arrangements do not apply in this case and the purchaser is liable for stamp duty at the new rates introduced in Budget 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1716">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 to 85, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">As Minister for Finance, I have no direct role in the day-to-day operations of the Central Bank.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that on 2 February 2011, the Bank announced appointments to the Consumer Advisory Group (CAG).  The members of the CAG are Mr. Michael Culloty, Mr. Dermott Jewell, Ms Elaine Kempson, Mr. Bill Knight and Dr. Anthony Walsh.  The CAG has met twice since its formation and the Bank expects that the group will hold some five or six meetings per annum.  As part of its remit, the CAG will advise the Bank in relation to the effects of the Bank's strategic plans on consumers of financial services as well as providing input into policy developments such as the revision of the Consumer Protection Code.  The workings of the CAG require confidentiality be observed in relation to their advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">I have been informed by the Bank that submissions in relation to Consultation Paper 47 (Review of the Consumer Protection Code) were received by the Bank in January this year.  Following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions, the Bank decided to undertake a second short consultation in relation to its review.  The Bank expects to publish the second consultation paper, which will outline the position it has reached on the questions posed in the first consultation paper, at the end of June 2011. The second consultation will also highlight additional and emerging issues which have come to attention as the Bank has considered responses to the first consultation, but also as a result of its ongoing regulatory work and on which the Bank believes further protections are required for consumers.  The Bank plans to publish a revised Consumer Protection Code towards the end of the third quarter of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">I have also been informed by the Bank that the Code of Conduct on the Switching of Current Accounts with Credit Institutions (the Switching Code) came into effect on 1 October 2010.  This Code is issued under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this code under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942. Credit institutions are required to comply with this code as a matter of law.  As part of the consultation on the revised Consumer Protection Code, the Bank invited comments and views on the statutory Switching Code.  The Bank will consider these responses relating to the Switching Code at a later date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">Finally, I have been informed by the Bank that it will publish an update to its banking strategy paper in the next month.  This will provide further information on the status of establishing a central credit register.  This is consistent with the commitment in the memorandum of understanding with the EU/IMF to provide a plan for enhancing the quality and availability of credit information available to credit providers by the end of September.</p>

            <p eId="para_1722">I wholeheartedly concur with the Deputy that failure at a board and individual director level of corporate governance standards played a major factor in the banking crisis.  This is supported by the findings of the various reports commissioned on the subject.  To strengthen oversight in this area, the Central Bank of Ireland has issued a mandatory Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings effective from 1 January 2011, subject to certain transitional procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">The code defines corporate governance as "procedures, processes and attitudes according to which an organisation is directed and controlled".  It imposes minimum core standards upon all credit institutions and additional requirements on entities designated as major institutions.  In addition, the Bank has issued a consultation paper (No. 51) — The Fit and Proper Regime in Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 — which seeks to address how new legislative powers relating to new and existing appointments, at individual executive and non-executive level mainly, will be implemented with a proposed effective date of 1 September 2011.  The advertisement for the positions specified that all appointments would be subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">While the competency of corporate governance was not specifically listed in the advertisement, headings such as risk management and business management — integral components of corporate governance — were mentioned.  Likewise, considerable experience in financial services was cited which, by definition, would have to entail exposure to corporate governance requirements.  The listing was not intended to be exhaustive.  It is my intention and that of the Government to ensure, through these processes and procedures, that individuals of high calibre and competency are available for selection for appointment to the boards of the covered institutions.  The Deputy will see from this reply that the issue of corporate governance will play a pivotal role in any prospective appointments.</p>

         when the review of the excise duty payable for licences for on-trade and off-licence sales of alcohol products which was announced on 7 December 2010 will commence; the terms of reference for the review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1726">The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, indicated in his Budget Statement on 7 December 2010 that a review would be undertaken of the excise duty payable for licences for on-trade and off-licence sales of alcohol products during 2011.  In that context, it has to be recognised that the main Exchequer receipts for the sale of alcohol arise from excise on alcohol products, which for example yielded €968 million in 2009, compared to a yield of approximately €13.6 million in respect of all alcohol excise licence fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Off-licence owners require a licence for each type of alcohol they sell, for each premises.   Excise duty on off-licences is currently set at €500 each per licence for a beer, wine or spirits off-licence, having been increased in recent years.  This means that a typical off-licence premises, including a supermarket, that offers the full range of alcoholic beverages for sale will have three off-licences and will be paying €1,500 per annum in duty.  Pubs have a graduated licence duty fee structure, based on turnover, ranging from €250 to €3,805.  Although there are six bands, over 70% of pubs fall within the two lowest bands and pay excise duty of €505 or less.  Some 85% of pubs pay annual licence fees of €1,140 or less, which is well below the usual full off-licence trader at €1,500 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">Approximately 10% of pubs pay licence fees that are clearly above those of off-licence traders.  The amounts involved are minor compared to the overall tax take otherwise from alcohol.  The average licence fee paid by the on-trade is around €778.  As is customary, the excise duty payable for alcohol licences will continue to be kept under review.</p>

Section 4(9) of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011, as initiated, contains provisions allowing pension scheme trustees or administrators the option of adjusting the benefits payable under a pension scheme on foot of payment of the duty.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Social Protection to establish if there is a need for any consequential amendment to be made by that Department to the Pensions Act.

The overall conclusion is that the previous analytical results were reasonable and that no new capital will be required as a result of these tests.  The two institutions have been adequately capitalised to meet the expected losses.  Further capital would only be required if the losses were at the stress or worst case estimates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1751">The purpose of approved pension schemes is to provide for an income in retirement.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in some cases, a member's entitlements under a scheme may be too small to justify the pension set-up costs (e.g. purchase of an annuity).  The Revenue Commissioners recognise the difficulty this can cause and will allow full commutation of the pension (the payment of the pension in one sum) in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">First, full commutation of a pension is permitted by Revenue on what is referred to as "triviality" grounds where the aggregate benefits payable to an individual from the scheme in respect of the employment does not exceed the value of a pension of €330 per annum.  The full amount of the pension commutation sum is subject to tax at a rate of 10%.  Full commutation of a pension is also allowed by Revenue where, following the payment of any tax-free lump sum, the total of all remaining funds from all sources available for pension benefits is less than €20,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">In a defined benefit scheme, the pension benefit is converted to a fund value using the scheme's commutation factor to determine if it is within the €20,000 limit.  This treatment is subject to the agreement of both the scheme beneficiary and the trustees and the resulting payment is treated like any other pension payment for the purposes of tax and is taxed under normal tax rules.  The €20,000 limit is reviewed from time to time and was last increased (from €15,000) in 2007.  This arrangement is allowed for under discretionary powers given to Revenue under section 772(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and is published in the Revenue Pensions Manual.</p>

            <p eId="para_1756">The Construction Federation Operatives Pension Scheme fully meets the requirements of the Registered Employment Agreement.  This Scheme is administered by the Construction Industry Federation and is available to all employers in the industry even though some may not be members of the federation.  Other pension arrangements may also be used as an alternative to the Construction Federation Operatives Pension Scheme, provided the terms in such arrangements are no less favourable than the terms in the Registered Employment Agreement.  The only exception to this is where a firm is registered in another member state of the EU and is working in this country and has employees temporarily posted from that jurisdiction who subscribe to a national pension scheme in their own country.  In such circumstances, the firm or its employees do not have to subscribe to an Irish pension scheme that satisfies the legislative requirement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1760">Section 825B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which has effect for the 2009 tax year onwards) provides relief to certain individuals who are not Irish domiciled and who, before they came to the State, had been living and working in a country with which the State has a double taxation agreement.  This is sometimes referred to as the Special Assignment Relief Programme.  The provision applies where the individual is sent by his or her foreign employer to work in the State for that employer or for an associated company of that employer and continues to be paid from abroad.   Under the provision, such individuals may have the tax on the income from the foreign employment that is attributable to duties of that employment exercised in the State reduced to the greater of the tax due on either (a) €100,000 plus 50% of the income of the employment over that amount; or (b) the income from that employment remitted to the State (any tax deducted by the employer via the PAYE system is deemed to be a remittance).</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">The provisions only apply if tax under the PAYE system has first been deducted in respect of the income of the non-Irish sourced employment attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of that employment.  If an individual makes a claim for repayment of tax under this section, and subsequently remits to the State more income from the employment, he or she will be liable to repay any tax refunded to Revenue.  Under the present scheme, which was introduced by the previous Government, there is no requirement for the qualifying individuals to have unique or scarce jobs skills.  As with all tax incentives and reliefs, the provisions of the current scheme will be reviewed as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1763">As announced under the Jobs Initiative, a second reduced VAT rate of 9% is to be introduced on a temporary basis in respect of certain services and goods mainly related to tourism for the period 1 July 2011 to the end of 2013.  Specifically, the 9% rate will apply to restaurant and catering services; hotel and holiday accommodation; various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions and fairgrounds or amusement parks, the use of sporting facilities; hairdressing services; and printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues, newspapers and magazines.  In reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, this measure is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">Given that it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of VAT reductions on increasing labour, the focusing of this measure on the tourism sector is designed to optimise its effectiveness in leading to employment growth.  The measure to be successful requires the reduction in VAT to be passed on to consumers through a reduction in prices in the tourism sector.  With this in mind, the VAT change announced in the Jobs Initiative will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.</p>

Termination dates beyond 31 December 2009 apply for pipeline projects in the case of nursing homes where certain qualifying conditions have been met by that date.  Where planning permission is required in relation to the work to be carried out, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date, and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority.  In such cases, the termination date for qualifying expenditure under the scheme is 30 June 2011.  I consider the time limits put in place under these transitional arrangements are reasonable.  Similar arrangements have been made in the past when other property-based incentive schemes have been terminated. I have no plans to extend the end- June 2011 deadline.</p>

If the "roll-over" arrangements are not sufficient to meet a school's NCSE approved allocation they must firstly contact their local schools for any surplus capacity and then, if necessary, avail of the application process to the Department under the circular.</p>

            <p eId="para_1794">I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no curtailment to Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Services, which is a major component of DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion.  The current provision of HSCL services will remain in the 200 post-primary and 345 urban primary schools participating in DEIS.  The process of allocating teaching resources to schools for the 2011-12 school year and the arrangements for filling vacant or new teaching positions takes place in the context of the Programme for National Recovery, the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland and the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">In relation to the Programme for National Recovery and the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, it is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting measures this year to ensure the number of teachers employed in schools is consistent with those programmes.  The existing arrangements continue to remain in place whereby schools can only fill their vacancies from the surplus permanent and CID holding teachers.  It is not possible to permit schools to fill vacancies in any other manner until the surplus permanent teachers are redeployed.  Schools with HSCL co-ordinator vacancies have been requested to hold off on making new appointments. Although HSCL co-ordinator appointments are made internally from among the staff of schools, the filling of the replacement post for the teacher deployed to undertake HSCL duties may have implications in relation to panel arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">Given that there are 248 surplus permanent and CID holding teachers remaining on panels, my Department will not decide until 10 June 2011 (at the earliest) whether to give schools authority to commence recruitment in any other manner.  My Department may decide at that stage to prioritise schools that have fully co-operated with the redeployment process.  Discussions with the relevant education partners also include devising whatever additional arrangements are necessary to facilitate the redeployment of any remaining permanent and CID holding teachers (including 21 surplus permanent teachers that do not currently have access to a redeployment panel).</p>

         the plans in place and/or proposed to address the relatively new phenomenon of cyber-bullying; his views on tackling new forms of bullying as they arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [13808/11]

          </question>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1800">I take the issue of bullying in schools very seriously.  I am committed to ensuring schools tackle bullying in all its forms.  Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  This code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board.  The guidelines, which were issued to schools in 2008, make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.  Therefore, every school must have in place a policy within the framework of its overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The Department has also issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  As a further aid to post-primary schools, the Department published a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour.  However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">The Deputy may be aware that when a Whole School Evaluation (WSE) is conducted by my Department's inspectorate, the code of behaviour, including its anti-bullying policy, is reviewed by the inspection team to check it is in line with the Department's guidelines.  Inspectors normally meet the principal, the board, post-holders, year heads, class teachers, programme co-ordinators, the pastoral care team, representatives of the students and parents.  During these meetings, there is a particular emphasis on the quality of student care and support.  The inspectors' evaluation is also informed by observations in classroom settings and throughout the school.  If there are weaknesses in a school's policy or implementation of policies, clear recommendations for improvement are made and are included in the published report of the inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Revised procedures for WSE in schools have recently been put in place.  A new element of the revised WSE process involves the issuing of questionnaires directly to pupils and parents.  Children and parents will be asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying, discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children.  This enhanced engagement with parents and pupils through questionnaires aims to further support all schools to implement effective measures to counter bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">The education of students in primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum.  Social, Personal and Health Education is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.  Since 2001, national professional development support services have provided ongoing support to schools in planning policies on child protection and the code of behaviour and in supporting teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE.  In addition, training on the Stay Safe Programme is offered on an ongoing basis to primary schools.  Other measures in place include the Webwise Internet safety initiative, the EU Safer Internet Programme campaign and the establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service which is working with over 70 post-primary schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</p>

            <p eId="para_1808">I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 109 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">All primary schools are required to implement standardised tests of English reading and mathematics at two stages of the primary cycle.  The tests have been devised taking account of the learning objectives of the published Primary School Curriculum and have been standardised for the Irish population.  My Department commissions cyclical national assessments of English and mathematics based on tests administered at two grade levels in primary schools, the results of which are published.  At second level, student performance is monitored through participation in the OECD International Programme of Student Assessment, which provides a national and international benchmark of student performance in reading literacy, mathematics and science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">The junior and leaving certificate examinations are designed to assess the achievement of the objectives of the published syllabuses that are approved across the range of subjects in second-level schools.  The performance of teachers and schools is evaluated on an ongoing basis by the inspectorate of my Department.  The frameworks for these evaluations are set out in the following publications: A Guide to Whole School Evaluation (WSE) in Primary Schools; A Guide to Whole School Evaluation in Post-Primary Schools; A Guide to Whole School Evaluation — Management, Leadership and Learning (WSE-MLL); and A Guide to Subject Inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Inspectors use a four-level quality continuum to describe the quality of educational provision in a school.  This continuum is described in two departmental publications, Looking at Our Schools: An Aid to Self-evaluation in Primary Schools; and Looking at Our School: An Aid to Self-evaluation in Second-level Schools.  All these publications and all the inspection reports published since February 2006 are available on my Department's website.  As part of the whole-school evaluation — management, leadership and learning (WSE-MLL) — process in post-primary schools and the whole-school evaluation process in primary schools questionnaires are administered to a representative sample of parents and students to get their views on the operation of the school.  The completed questionnaires provide an insight into the views of parents and students on the performance of the school and are a key source of evidence as part of the evaluation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Responsibility for school improvement rests primarily with the staff and board of management of each school and with the school's trustees or patron.  The board may use the school's own planning and review processes to review the school's performance.  They may also use the school's inspection reports, which provide teachers, principals and boards with feedback on the quality of the education provided in a school and how this can be improved.  These reports deal with key aspects of the work of the school and they make recommendations on aspects for development that will improve the quality of the educational provision in the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1814">The leadership and planning strand of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provides professional development opportunities for aspiring, new and established school leaders in a range of programmes and activities.  There are over 4,000 schools between the primary and post-primary sectors.  In the current school year, the PDST is providing leadership development programmes for 1,158 school leaders or aspiring leaders.  I will set out the breakdown between the programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">Some 553 newly appointed school leaders participated on the induction programmes (Misneach and Tánaiste).  Some 414 established school leaders availed of the Forbairt and Spreagadh programmes.  Some 123 aspiring leaders are participating in the Tóraíocht programme.  Some 68 principals have trained as mentors to newly appointed principals.  Tóraíocht is a programme for aspiring principals which is offered in partnership between PDST and NUI Maynooth.  It aims to enhance participants' current work and support their preparation for future senior leadership positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The Misneach programme is a professional development programme for newly appointed school leaders.  The programme seeks to help new leaders to meet the challenges of their new roles by developing their personal and professional capacities.  The programme consists of four modules — Leading Learning, Leading People, Leading the Organisation and Personal Development.  Tánaiste is an induction programme for newly appointed Deputy Principals or Acting Deputy Principals.  The programme aims to develop the skills necessary for Deputy Principals to approach their role with confidence and to work effectively with the Principal and other school leaders to ensure high quality teaching and learning in the school.  Some 1,642 places were provided in the previous year.  The year on year reduction reflects an adjustment in the capacity and resources available to the PDST.</p>

            <p eId="para_1818">The Professional Development Service for Teachers offers a suite of professional development opportunities to school leaders including programmes for aspiring, new, and established principals and deputy principals.  All of these services are provided to school leaders who request them.  In relation to school principals who are identified as needing additional support, as outlined in sections 22 and 23 of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management, as employer, has overall responsibility for the management of the school, including the guidance and direction of staff and the creation of an environment which is supportive of learning among the students and which promotes the professional development of teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">Section 24(3) of the Act provides for the suspension and dismissal of teachers by boards of management.  In 2009, agreed procedures for the operation of Section 24(3) were published.  As part of these procedures, inter alia, principals can avail of support from the support services under the remit of my Department.  In this context, the Chairperson will advise the Principal of available internal and/or external supports and endeavour to assist the Principal in accessing supports.  These may include the Employee Assistance Service, the teacher support services or other external agencies that are relevant or appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">Reasonable and appropriate support, training and assistance will be provided.  Therefore, a focus of the work of the teacher support services is the provision of appropriate advice and assistance to school management and principals in the formulation of improvement plans and, where relevant, in their implementation.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers has developed draft protocols for its work in supporting principals and teachers involved in Section 24 procedures and have trained team members in responding to specific cases.  The service has access to full-time and part-time facilitators who can respond to the needs of principals in leading such cases or indeed to support principals or teachers who are subject to procedures under Section 24.  The PDST also includes some more general guidance workshops for principals on its leadership programmes and in some other wider seminars involving school leaders' representative bodies, as well as individualised supports to school leaders who request them due to specific challenges that arise in their leadership of schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1824">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 to 113, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">The supply of suitably qualified teachers is a matter of strategic importance to the State.  It is widely acknowledged that the quality of teachers impacts directly on the quality of education.  The initial teacher education providers are members of a dynamic teaching and learning community, providing a quality lifelong learning approach to teacher education that promotes reflective practice and ongoing renewal.  All the providers listed by the Deputy have university status or have institutional or accreditation linkages to universities.  Quality assurance in the university sector is governed by statutory provision and is carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board.  It is based on expert peer review of Irish and international experts, and must include representation from students, business and other stakeholders.  Quality assurance of linked providers of universities is provided for in the internal quality assurance procedures of the university.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">All teacher education programmes in Ireland that lead to registration must have also have current professional accreditation, which is the statutory responsibility of the Teaching Council.  In accordance with section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the Council is empowered to review and professionally accredit programmes of initial teacher education.  In 2009, the Council began reviewing programmes on a pilot basis and four reviews were completed in the 2009-10 academic year.  A further four programmes are undergoing review in 2010-11.  The reviews are carried out by independent review panels working on the Council's behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Each panel reviews the programmes based on a thorough assessment of programme documentation and a visit to each college, which includes meetings with programme staff and students as well as graduates of the programme and employers of those graduates.  The panel also inspects teaching and learning facilities, observes a sample of lectures, views students' project work and visits schools where teaching practice is taking place.  Following consideration of its findings, the Review Panel makes a recommendation to the Council on whether accreditation should be granted and may also include recommendations for implementation by the programme provider via a time-bound action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The Deputy may also be interested to note that in December 2010, the Teaching Council published its draft policy on the Teacher Education Continuum.  An extensive programme of research and consultation was undertaken by the Council to bring the draft policy to this stage of development.  The process will facilitate the emergence of a shared vision for teacher education among the relevant stakeholders and ensure that the underlying principles which will guide teacher education in the future are in line with international good practice.  The policy is due to be published in 2011.</p>

        <b> Deputy Joe Carey</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         when he expects to publish the findings of the review on value for money of small primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [13821/11]

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_503">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2063">The value for money review on small schools is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews.  These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained and the public consultations were designed to achieve this aim.  This was done by issuing a direct invitation to relevant interest groups to provide a submission.  The interest groups included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, the National Parents Council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">A letter inviting submissions was issued on 8 February 2011 to these interest groups and a deadline for reply was set for 18 March.  As these groups represent a wide spectrum of membership, it could be reasonably expected they would communicate with their membership in regard to the review.  In addition to the direct letter of invitation issued to these groups, a general invitation for submissions was posted on the Department's website also at the same time.  The large response of more than 1,000 submissions seems to support the view that there is high awareness of the review and a lot of interest in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for the reorganisation of small schools, including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools.  It is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.  The review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology.  It is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy.  It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or any particular outcome is sought.  Given that the Government has recently announced a comprehensive review of expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities.  In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, the Department is conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.  Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  Decisions on school provision and reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable.  These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at regional and national levels.  The review should be completed by the end of 2011.  Following completion, it will be submitted to me for consideration of its conclusions and recommendations.  It is too early to give an expected publication date.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_2075">The co-funding of relevant education and training measures through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of redundant SR Technics workers is strictly time limited to finish on 9 October 2011.  This end date is determined at two years from the date of application, in accordance with the regulations governing the operation of the fund, and cannot be extended.  This position has always been made clear to service providers and to beneficiaries of EGF support, including the former SR Technics staff in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">It was also therefore always clear to the former SR Technics workers that the full duration of the course would not be funded by the State and that funding would end before accreditation was achieved.  On the question of alternative funding, officials from my Department met a delegation of the former workers last month and discussed in detail the position in relation to EGF funding and the full range of options and supports that are available to students generally, including former SR Technics staff, who wish to pursue education programmes in the publicly funded higher education system.  I have written to a member of the delegation re-emphasising the position as outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">The closing date for submission of proposals for funding under the Springboard initiative was 18 March 2011.  The results of the selection process were announced on 25 May 2011. Funding was available under Springboard for higher education programmes delivered on a part-time basis.  The Department of Social Protection has already confirmed that if the students remain on the programme on a full-time basis beyond the EGF cut-off date, that will be entitled to retain their Back to Education Allowance.  This would be a considerable advantage to the students in terms of providing income support while progressing in education.  It should also be noted that All Hallows College has been extremely helpful in running what was originally a part-time course on a full-time basis under the EGF programme in order to accelerate students' progress on a modular basis and maximise the scope for them to benefit from the EU funding available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">It is open to the students to engage with All Hallows College to seek a reduced course fee for continuance of the course full-time but at their own expense.  Alternatively, the relevant students could potentially transfer to other full-time courses in the public system which are part of the Free Fees Scheme without losing their Back to Education Allowance.  The accreditation of learning gained at All Hallows College prior to any such transfer is a matter for the college in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2080">I wish to advise the Deputy that there are no cutbacks to Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Services, which is a major component of DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion.  The current provision of HSCL services will remain in the 200 post primary and 345 urban primary schools participating in DEIS.  The process of allocating teaching resources to schools for the 2011-12 school year and the arrangements for filling vacant or new teaching positions takes place in the context of the Programme for National Recovery, the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland and the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">In relation to the Programme for National Recovery and the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, it is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting measures this year to ensure the number of teachers employed in schools is consistent with those programmes.  The existing arrangements continue to remain in place whereby schools can only fill their vacancies from the surplus permanent and CID holding teachers.  It is not possible to permit schools to fill vacancies in any other manner until the surplus permanent teachers are redeployed.  Schools with HSCL co-ordinator vacancies were requested to hold off making new appointments. Although HSCL co-ordinator appointments are made internally from among the staff of schools, the filling of the replacement post for the teacher deployed to undertake HSCL duties may have implications in relation to panel arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">Given that there are 248 surplus permanent and CID holding teachers remaining on panels, my Department will not make a decision until 10 June 2011 (at the earliest) on giving schools authority to commence recruitment in any other manner.  My Department may decide at that stage to prioritise schools that have fully co-operated with the redeployment process.  Discussions with the relevant education partners also include devising whatever additional arrangements are necessary to facilitate the redeployment of any remaining permanent and CID holding teachers (including 21 surplus permanent teachers that do not currently have access to a redeployment panel).</p>

            <p eId="para_2084">In the 1993-94 academic year, national certification for Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses was introduced for the first time by the National Council for Vocational Awards.  A fee structure was negotiated with the teacher unions by my Department on the basis of a fee per module per student, in line with practice in other State examinations, where payment is made for work undertaken in addition to normal teaching duties.  These payments continued to be paid with the transfer of functions from the National Council for Vocational Awards to the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC).</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The assessments are carried out on students' work prior to the submission of authenticated results to FETAC.  In the current academic year, these authenticated results are required to be forwarded to FETAC by 5 June 2011 to facilitate the issue of certification in July.  This meant all assessments had to be undertaken and verified internally and externally prior to the 5 June deadline.  Teachers in PLC courses are required to undertake a range of duties in addition to their teaching duties as part of their normal working year, including participation in the promotion of courses, involvement with the internal verification and the external verification process and involvement in the selection of students for the next academic year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2102">The Deputy will be aware that the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR) as it relates to primary school transport eligibility was announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derives from a recommendation in the published Value for Money Review of the scheme.  Given the major financial constraints facing the country, it is not possible to change the decision announced by the previous Government.  This change to the CSR is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school.  Given the timeframe for the review, this sample of schools was randomly selected and the findings were then aggregated nationally.  As I have stated on many occasions recently, before implementing this change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the "on the ground" impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current school transport usage patterns. I expect to have this information available to me this summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2110">As the Deputy is aware all funding allocated under my Department's Devolved Schemes including the Summer Works Scheme to allow school management authorities carry out building or improvement works to their schools, must be offered to the market in accordance with EU and National procurement guidelines.  School management authorities must comply with all the requirements of Technical Guidance Documents TGD 007 and TGD 008 (Design Team Procedures for Small Works and Engaging Professional Consultants for Small Works respectively) which are available on my Department's website. Failure to do so may expose the school management authorities to challenge and subsequent financial penalties from a consultant or contractor who feels he/she was not afforded an opportunity to tender.  Any such challenge could also result in the project being substantially delayed.  The circular letters for devolved schemes deals with the appointment of consultants for the preparation of reports and is specific that consultants should be appointed for that task only.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2112">The Government is fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with the key high potential markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, as these countries are very promising destinations for the sale of Irish goods and services.  The agreed Programme for Government sets out clearly that Ireland's economic recovery must be export-led. That Programme commits us to achieve the maximum growth in exports, including the long-term development of new markets. In addition, the Government has given a commitment to progressively implement the recommendations in the strategy and action plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, entitled <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i> which will inter alia, position Ireland to develop better trade relationships with emerging economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">That Strategy takes a two-pronged approach, focussing on particular markets and sectors. In terms of markets, it identifies potential to further grow our existing key markets — and, most particularly, to increase or gain a foothold in high-growth and high-potential markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. The targets agreed by the relevant State Agencies — Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland — are to be implemented through a suite of actions driven by a new Trade Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">Key instruments to pursue trade expansion are, of course, Trade Missions and over the last five years, Taoiseach-led Trade Missions have been organised to China and India and several other Ministerial-led Trade Missions have taken place to China, India, Russia and Brazil.  I myself led a  Trade Mission to India in April last, with 22 Enterprise Ireland client companies participating, where  I officiated on a  successful programme of events to promote our exports to that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">A further indicator of commitment is the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs has expanded its network of Embassies and Consulates in some of those countries and Enterprise Ireland has opened new offices to facilitate Irish companies developing export opportunities there.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated High Growth Markets Unit in Dublin to provide further assistance to client companies doing business in a range of countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">My own Department is engaged in the promotion of Ireland's trade interests through for example, the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements between the EU and third countries.  A Free Trade Agreement is now under negotiation with India and another with South Korea comes into effect on 1 July this year. I also place a particular emphasis on promoting less restrictive global trade arrangements by means of the current round of world trade talks at the World Trade Organisation and developing new opportunities for exporters by reductions in tariff and non tariff barriers through trade and regulatory discussions between the EU and China, Russia, Brazil and the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">All the efforts have borne considerable fruit.  Between 2005 and 2010, Merchandise exports to these countries have risen 73% and between 2004 and 2009 (latest available year). Services exports have risen by 622% . A key example of this success is the fact that Ireland now has a modest trade surplus with China, a dramatic turnaround from the position only three years ago when we had a trade deficit of €2.9bn with that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2119">Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core. The role of my Department is to drive Ireland's competitiveness and productivity by creating the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities are grown and maintained and to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention. The Government's Jobs Initiative will facilitate the implementation of a number of measures across a range of Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">Within that context, my Department, through the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provides support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases by both financial and non-financial assistance. The remit of these Boards as part of a nationwide Network is to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate entrepreneurship in their area throughout the country. Business growth, job creation and retention are central to the activities of the CEBs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">In addition, the CEBs deliver a wide range of non-financial supports such as Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business Networks. These supports are designed to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises and to assist new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">As Minister, I welcome contributions on measures which will further assist in Ireland's economic recovery. In relation to the specific proposal being made, as the CEBs unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business I would advise that contact be made in the first instance with their local CEB to discuss the proposal in more detail. Contact details for each CEB may be found at their website <i>www.enterpriseboards.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">In addition, the National Training and Employment Authority, FÁS, operating under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, operates training and employment programmes, provides a recruitments service to jobseekers and employers, an advisory service for industry, and supports community-based enterprises, and I would advise that contact be made as appropriate with FÁS to discuss employer recruitment services. Further details may be explored through the FÁS website <i>www.fas.ie</i>.</p>

Some €30 million has been provided in the Department's Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.  This initiative is delivered through the network of local development companies and Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  Participants will, in the first instance, be identified by the Department of Social Protection by applying the following conditions:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2129">A person must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months, and</p>

For this reason, eligibility is at present confined to those on the Live Register for 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.  Persons already in employment are not eligible for these positions.  The operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, will be kept under review and will inform the evaluation process in due course.</p>

Persons are engaged for 19½ hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  Each participant is paid the equivalent of the maximum rate of the social welfare payment they are entitled to plus €20 per week.

The level of resources available within the RSS to support the purchase, maintenance and repair of equipment to support the delivery of services is constrained.  Implementing bodies are encouraged to prioritise existing resources and to generate local sources of funding to ensure continuing operations are maintained.</p>

         if she will confirm that the rules of a spousal swap pass the entitlements of a social welfare scheme in totality from one spouse to another in order to permit that spouse participate in a rural social scheme thus removing the eligibility to participate in such a scheme from the spouse who had the initial entitlement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2137">The purpose of the rural social scheme (RSS) is to provide income support for farmers and fisherpersons who have an entitlement to specified social welfare payments.  Persons are engaged for 19½ hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  Each participant is paid the equivalent of the maximum rate of the social welfare payment they are entitled to receive plus €20 per week.  The RSS is operated by my Department and delivered at local level by 35 local development companies and by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 men and women and 130 supervisory staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">Under the arrangements by which the eligibility criteria for the RSS are implemented, a person eligible in his/her own right to participate on the scheme may avail of an option to transfer the eligibility to his or her spouse or civil partner.  In this regard, a qualified adult dependant aged 25 years and over of an eligible person may avail of the spousal swap option.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">This involves the person exchanging his or her placement opportunity on the scheme with his or her adult qualified dependant.  The dependent spouse/civil partner will inherit the age and entitlements of the eligible person.  This ensures that no loss is incurred in the relative entitlements of the couple as a result of the exchange.  The person who transferred the entitlement is generally not allowed to participate in other programmes such as community employment or positions funded by the community services programme.  In the event that a person who engaged in a spousal swap takes up employment or training opportunities, the entitlement may lapse with implications for the dependent adult who is participating on the RSS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">In circumstances where a person participates on the RSS on the basis of a spousal swap, the participant must resign from the scheme when the entitlement of their spouse/civil partner expires.  This arises in cases where the eligible person reaches retirement age, takes up employment or avails of opportunities provided under other training or employment schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2144">The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2147">The Department operates a range of schemes which can, subject to conditions, be paid to individuals as an extra allowance, or as a separate payment, in addition to their standard social welfare payment. The payments include living alone increase, allowances under the supplementary welfare allowance schemes, household benefits, fuel allowance, respite care grant and island allowance.  In the time available it is not possible to compile details of  all the schemes which are available to the different categories of claimant resident here and receiving social welfare payments from Ireland or from other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">The living alone increase  is an additional payment of  €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.  The increase is not a payment in its own right but one that is paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made exclusively under the social security regimes of other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">I have no plans to change these arrangements. I would point out that the needs of older people are often provided for in different ways by other countries. While the Irish system provides a basic pension, supplemented by allowances, increases and other benefits, the approach adopted by other countries can be very different involving, for instance, a pension based on pre-retirement earnings.</p>

            <p eId="para_2160">Mink found in the wild in Ireland are descended from animals that escaped from fur farms.  They have been breeding in the countryside since the 1950s and are now found throughout much of the country.  A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated that the potential population of wild mink in the State was between 20,500 and 33,500 individuals.  The report identified ground nesting birds as the species most vulnerable to mink predation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">However, the cost of a national cull would be prohibitive at this time.   Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns from a range of predators including mink.   Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these species.  In addition, I have instructed my Department to consider options for increased control of the numbers of mink.  As wild mink are not protected under the Wildlife Acts they can be controlled by landowners and their agents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2171">In April 2006 the Task force on Active Citizenship was established to review the evidence regarding trends in citizen participation across the main areas of civic, community, cultural, occupational and recreational life in Ireland.  Following a consultation process, the Task force compiled a set of recommendations to enhance active citizenship in Ireland.  The main recommendations relate to increasing participation in the democratic process; improving the interaction between the citizen and state institutions at local and national level, measures to promote a greater sense of community and community engagement; further education on the issues around active citizenship; and measures that provide increased opportunities for the inclusion of ethnic and cultural minorities in an increasingly diverse society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">The Task force recommendations were accepted in principle by the then Government in March 2007. As a first step in implementation, an Office of Active Citizenship was established on a non-statutory basis in the Department of the Taoiseach. The then Government Chief Whip, was assigned special responsibility for the overall direction of the active citizenship initiative and was assisted in this regard by a Steering Group.  The Steering Group met on five occasions from its appointment in October 2008 and last met in October 2009. In addition, the three Subgroups working on (i) the Active Citizenship Week (ii) the Active Citizenship Conference and (iii) Voter Education met a total of six times. The work of the Active Citizenship Office was discontinued in November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">In May 2010, responsibility for progressing the Active Citizenship agenda was transferred to the then Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and on the 1 May 2011 this area transferred to my Department.  Given the current resource constraints, it is appropriate that the focus on active citizenship is a more pragmatic one where civic engagement is mainstreamed into the work of Government at Departmental and Local Government level.</p>

            <p eId="para_2177">In response to the downturn in the housing market and the prevailing economic climate in 2008, the private investment envisaged for a number regeneration projects in Dublin City did not materialise.  As a result, the City Council suspended its PPP programme for a number of estates including O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street, Croke Villas, and St Teresa's Gardens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">In the absence of PPP alternatives and with the support of my Department, the City Council established a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Task force to examine all options with regard to the future regeneration of the areas concerned and, in particular, options to fast-track the relocation of households to facilitate future regeneration.  To the end of May 2011, my Department has supported the City Council in this objective as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2203">In February 2011 the previous Government announced its plans for a structured dialogue between the then Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and the 17 members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar under Social Partnership. The impetus for the dialogue was that, under the Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement and the Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, the Government had committed to engaging with the Community &amp; Voluntary sector to deepen the partnership between statutory bodies and voluntary and community organisations. It was proposed that the dialogue would be undertaken initially on a bilateral basis between the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Community and Voluntary Pillar, and, subject to good progress, other Departments would be invited into the process, to engage on cross-cutting issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">On 1 May, responsibility for Community affairs transferred to my Department. On 26 May, I announced at The Wheel's annual conference in Dublin that I will honour the commitment to engage in a structured dialogue with the members of the Community &amp; Voluntary Pillar. However, I noted that such dialogue would have to take account of the new Departmental structures and policy context as well as the Government's review of expenditure.  In particular, I believe that there is significant scope to enhance the delivery and coordination of services and resources at local level, and in this regard the community sector is a key stakeholder.  The dialogue will therefore take account of the community sector's central role and the relationship with the State, local government and local development sectors as well as the other social partner pillar members.</p>

The EYV Steering Group has met six times since July 2010, and most recently on 3 May 2011.  President McAleese is Patron of EYV 2011 in Ireland and presided over the official Opening Ceremony, on 12 February 2011 at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.

The NCB updates the site daily and has launched a web campaign to profile volunteers and smaller voluntary organisations around Ireland. The EYV Steering Group members contribute to site content and have promoted the website within their own organisations, via their websites and newsletters.  The NCB also distributes EYV promotional materials and online marketing tools such as EYV branded headers, logos and linked buttons to organisations, public spaces and to individuals who request them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2224">During negotiations in respect of the Rural Development Programme, the European Commission indicated that the OECD definition of rural areas should be used to define the rural areas that would be covered by the Programme.  The OECD defines rural areas as those with a population density of less than 150 persons per square kilometre.  It was considered, in the Irish context, that a more appropriate course of action would be to remove the urban areas defined as hubs and gateways in the National Spatial Strategy from coverage under the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">The use of this definition, rather than a population density calculation, ensures that Axes 3 &amp; 4 Rural Development Programme funding is available to a more significant number of rural areas, which would otherwise not receive funding under the Programme.

This resulted in the reconstitution of the operational area for the purposes of implementing the RDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">The local development strategy of FLP details the rationale behind the development strategy as well as detailing the areas to be covered by the strategy. A number of EDs in the greater Dublin area had been excluded from previous LEADER programmes on the basis that they are very urban in nature and had high population densities greatly exceeding the OECD definition of a rural area i.e. an area with a population density below 150 people per sq km.  As a result of the comprehensive review conducted prior to the current RDP further areas were excluded reflecting significant population increases in many areas in Dublin.</p>

In this context the areas referred to in the  question are not eligible under Axes 3 and 4 of the current the RDP and as such no actions to support enterprise and job creation in the areas mentioned can be supported from RDP funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_2248">The timing of the submission to Government and publication of the Office of Public Works (OPW) working group's report are matters for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The working group's terms of reference include examining the regulatory requirements for the site and advising the Government on the site's most beneficial future use. Plans for future use will determine the levels and extent of further works and/or remediation required.  I understand that the working group has finalised its report, and I look forward to considering the report's conclusions with my Government colleagues.</p>

            <p eId="para_2490">One of the main features of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is that local authorities, in sourcing accommodation for households, co-operate with the private and voluntary sector and enter into contractual arrangements to secure medium to long-term availability of rented accommodation. It is a matter for each local authority to negotiate appropriate contracts to suit their needs.  Under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative (SHLI), leases of between 10 to 25 years can be entered into by either local authorities or approved housing bodies to secure accommodation. Again, it is a matter for each local authority or approved body to negotiate appropriate contracts to suit their needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2492">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  These Regulations were further amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses)(Amendment) Regulations 2009 which expanded the definition of ‘a proper state of structural repair' to allow for all aspects of the internal and external appearance of a dwelling to be taken into account for the purposes of the Regulations.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2493">This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2009, rising from €1.5m to €4m. In 2010, the amount allocated to housing authorities for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation was increased by €1.6m. This total allocation of €5.6m for 2010, which brings the total funding for this purpose since 2004 to over €20m, was paid using a combined methodology based on the number of inspections carried out by each housing authority and on once-off strategically planned programmes of inspection which may be carried out by housing authorities in addition to their usual inspection activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections increasing by more than 300% — from 6,815 to 21,614 in the period 2005 to 2010.  Details of the inspections of private rented accommodation carried out, the dwellings inspected which did not meet the statutory standards, and prosecutions initiated up to 2009 on a county/city basis are included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>. The 2009 data show a year on year increase in the number of inspections carried out of approximately 15%, to 19,801 inspections, and this reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards  , including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and progress with the implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements.  However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement   published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities.</p>

Since the mid 1990s the Department of Defence has been engaged in a programme of disposing of surplus properties and using the proceeds for reinvestment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The former Connolly Barracks is one such property.  Longford County Council has expressed some interest in acquiring the Barracks and discussions with the Council are at a preliminary stage in this regard. In the event of these discussions not reaching a satisfactory outcome Connolly Barracks will be disposed of taking account of the market conditions so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces. In the meantime I have asked the Departmental officials concerned to make contact with the County Council to see if a basis exists to bring the discussions to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.</p>

This gives rise to some NCHDs being required to work additional hours from time to time.  Under the new Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) Contract agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation in 2010, NCHDs should not be rostered to work for more than 24 consecutive hours on-site. Furthermore,  the contract provides that NCHDs who are rostered to work on-site for a period of 24 hours will only do so on a 1 in 5 basis other than in exceptional circumstances.  In these circumstances NCHDs are to receive their full compensatory rest entitlements before their next period of work.  The contract terms reflect the Collective Agreement reached between the Health Service Executive and the IMO on 22 January 2010.  These terms also reflect the requirements of the European Working Time Directive and its transposition in to Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">Compliance with European Working Time Directive is a challenge to hospitals and to the HSE in relation to the employment of NCHDs and the provision of services.  However, compliance with the Directive is good for patient safety.  It serves no good purpose to have over-stretched, over-tired junior doctors treating patients.  There is an onus on hospital management to ensure that service are not being provided by over-tired doctors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2790">Pre-School services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.  Regulation 12, together with the Explanatory Guide thereto, provides for the maximum adult to child ratios which are recommended depending on the age range and type of pre-school service in question.  For example, a ratio of one adult to 3 children is recommended in the case of a child aged up to 1 year being cared for in a full daycare service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The Child Care Regulations 2006 were introduced following wide-ranging consultations with the pre-school sector and the adult to child ratios were determined as part of this process.  While I am not aware of any call from the sector to amend or reduce the ratios which are currently in place, the regulatory environment for child care services will continue to be kept under review with a view to providing the best environment for children which also takes account of practical considerations for service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">I am aware that, along with other areas of the economy, child care services have experienced a downturn in numbers attending since 2008.  I believe it is important to support the sector through these times for a number of reasons.  Clearly, the State has made a very significant capital investment in the sector which should be protected into the future.  More importantly, quality early childhood care and education services are of vital importance to ensuring young children's well-being during this key developmental stage of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">For this reason, I am committed to maintaining my Department's work in funding some 4,500 pre-school services across the country, in effect almost every pre-school in the State, through the three major early childhood care and education programmes which I am responsible for.  These programmes, which include the free Pre-School Year, invest some €240 million per annum in pre-school services, supporting some 100,000 pre-school children attending.</p>

            <p eId="para_2809">The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides for a clear compulsory requirement for registration for all medical practitioners, including cosmetic surgeons, who practise medicine in Ireland.  Under the Act the Medical Council is charged with responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810">Persons who avail of the services of doctors performing cosmetic surgery should ideally discuss this decision in advance with their general practitioner and should endeavour to seek the services of reputable providers.  When invasive procedures are being arranged, persons would be strongly advised to check that the services are provided by a medical practitioner who is appropriately registered with the Medical Council.  In addition, before agreeing to undergo any procedure, persons should ascertain the level of follow-up medical support which will be available to them after the surgery has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2811">A Bill is in preparation to amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to make it mandatory for all medical practitioners engaged in clinical practice to have adequate clinical indemnity cover in place.  The new provisions will give power to the Medical Council to refuse to grant registration to a medical practitioner who fails to provide certification evidencing that s/he has appropriate medical indemnity cover.  Further legislation to regulate this sector is being considered in the context of the development of legislative proposals for the licensing of health care providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2813">The medication mentioned by the Deputy is a cannabis-based medicinal product.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis-based medicinal products is unlawful except for the purposes of research.  I am aware that claims have been made in respect of the possible health benefits of cannabis-based medicinal products for patients suffering from certain conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis.  I am also aware that cannabis-based medicinal products may be legally prescribed in other countries.  However, as the law currently stands, it is not possible for cannabis-based medicinal products to be authorised for medicinal use or for prescription by a medical practitioner in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">However, my Department is examining the issues associated with applying controls, similar to those that apply to other controlled drugs that can be misused, such as morphine and methadone, to cannabis-based medicinal products.  Neither the product mentioned nor any other cannabis-based medicinal product is currently authorised in Ireland and consequently the efficacy, safety and quality of such products have not, as yet, been demonstrated.</p>

            <p eId="para_2818">The free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which was introduced in January 2010, is implemented by the Childcare Directorate in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2011.  There is no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age and children born in July and August of 2008 will qualify for the programme in September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">The ECCE programme is available to all eligible children and it is a matter for parents to decide if they wish their child to avail of the scheme or if they wish to send their child to primary school.  The objective of the programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">A number of parents have asked for the lower age range to be reduced on the grounds that they wish to send their children to school when they are 4 years and 2 months of age or less.  The issue was referred by some of these parents to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That Office found no reason to remove or amend the lower age range, accepting it as reasonable having regard to the various factors which apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_2828">Terms of reference  and the overall approach to the forthcoming review of the taxi sector are close to finalisation and will be announced shortly.  The review will be undertaken in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The review will enable necessary further qualitative reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.  The review will allow for consultation with all stakeholders — despatch operators, drivers, consumers as well as regulatory and enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">The review will also focus on issues of compliance and enforcement, including the disturbing practices highlighted in the recent RTE "Prime Time Investigates" Programme.  I envisage that the review will report within a period of 4 months on a recommended speedy programme of action to include any changes that may be appropriate to legislation, regulatory policies and practices and enforcement arrangements and deployment of resources.   Following appropriate  consideration of the review recommendations I will, of course, seek early Government  approval of its necessary implementation including legislative changes that may be required.</p>

My officials and I have engaged with the Dublin Airport Authority and with the four main Irish airlines about these initiatives and I have also written to all of the other airlines operating services to and from the State airports.  The discussions with the airlines are continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">The Finance (No. 2) Bill is being debated in the House this week and will make legislative provision for the suspension of the air travel tax.  I have made it absolutely clear in my engagement with the airlines that the Government is only prepared to commence this provision if the airlines demonstrate a willingness to respond positively to these initiatives. The Dublin Airport Authority is actively engaged in discussions with the airlines in relation to the growth incentive scheme and is also ensuring that the airlines are fully aware of the Government‘s position that the travel tax will only be abolished when the airlines commit to deliver more tourists to Ireland.  This position will continue to be reviewed in the context of traffic performance in the current year as well as stated plans by airlines for growth in future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2846">It is not the practice to comment on specific security measures in place or that may be implemented at the State's airports or on monitoring activities carried out by my Department.  However, it should be noted that the perimeter fencing at Cork airport is regularly inspected and patrolled by Airport Police.  The fencing is the same type as is used in the vast majority of airports across the EU and beyond.  It complies fully with the EU aviation security regulations and the National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) which in itself is based on the highest international standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).  I can assure the Deputy that this incursion is being taken very seriously and that appropriate follow up measures are being taken, including a review into the matter by the Dublin Airport Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_2850">A scoping study for a cycling and walking route along the Boyne Valley was completed in 2010.  The study was commissioned by Meath County Council, and was funded by my Department.  While the potential future development of this route is primarily a matter for the local authorities, I understand that my officials have been available to meet with the local authorities concerned.  Funding for a single project of the scale outlined in the scoping study is not available from within the existing budget within my Department for such works.   Indeed, should future funding of this or similar routes be possible, it is likely that it would be on the basis of phased, and cost effective, delivery plans, concentrating on initial delivery of key elements of the route.</p>

            <p eId="para_2854">Irish road haulage costs are influenced by many matters such as supply and demand in the marketplace, fuel and motor taxation as well as regulatory and road use charges under the remit of my Department and its Agencies.  As is the case with all motorists, hauliers are obliged to pay tolls, motor and fuel taxation and to pay towards the upkeep of their vehicles so that they remain roadworthy from a road safety perspective.  Hauliers must also comply with road safety legislation including the Working Time Directive, which regulates for maximum permissible driver hours over short time periods.  I have no information that suggests that Irish road haulage costs are higher than those in adjoining jurisdictions.  Some costs are lower in Ireland — hauliers here do not pay time based vignettes or charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">Looking at freight transport generally, I am acutely aware of the great importance of the freight transport sector to Ireland's economic recovery.   My Department engages with air, sea, rail and road freight interests through its establishment of and involvement with the All-Island Freight Forum.  This Forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development.  One of its primary roles is to draw together the Government side and industry stakeholders to identify and implement measures to secure competitive, sustainable and safe freight transport domestically and internationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2861">My Department has no direct control of transport costs in general but keeps under review costs arising from the services provided through our agencies.  International comparative data on transport costs are not readily available from respected international statistical sources such as Eurostat and the International Transport Forum.  Cost competitiveness is a key consideration for Ireland as an open export-oriented economy and transport is one of the many factors influencing that competitiveness.</p>

            <p eId="para_2864">There are great synergies between tourism and sport.   In particular sports tourism can be a valuable instrument in the promotion of Ireland both at home and abroad.   Already this year the Aviva Stadium has hosted the Europa League Final which introduced thousands of Portuguese fans to our country.  Ireland is also hosting the Volvo Ocean Yacht race and  the Solheim Cup which will further boost our economy and showcase Ireland as a country worth visiting and doing business with.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">In terms of building on the Good Friday Agreement all-island sports are very important.  Cricket is a good example.  The Irish team plays for the Republic and the North, for Protestants and Catholics, and those of no particular persuasion.   The highlight of this sporting year may well have been our team's performance in the Cricket World Cup.   The defeat of England, in particular, probably did more to raise Ireland's profile in the sub-continent of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh than the work of our embassy and agencies combined.  It has opened a lot of doors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">Success in sport provides a means of projecting a national image to an international public.  In addition success on the international stage, for example Rugby Grand Slam, Heineken Cup, Olympic Boxing, raises the morale of the people and shows that even as a small nation we can equal or surpass larger nations.</p>
