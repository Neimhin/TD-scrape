            <from>Deputy Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, if consideration can be given to the introduction of additional nationwide organised screening programmes for two of the four major cancers in Ireland, namely, prostate cancer and lung cancer, taking into account that the national screening programmes for breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer have led to the early detection of cases in recent decades, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> The screening programmes, BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelCheck, have been successful despite all of the criticism of them. It is important we recognise the people who have been at the forefront in pushing those programmes forward and those working on the front line. Looking at cancer diagnoses, prostrate cancer accounts for 16% of all cancer diagnoses in Ireland, while across the European Union it is 13%. Lung cancer accounts for 11% of diagnoses here and 12% of diagnoses across the European Union. Between 1995 and 2019, the number of cancer cases increased by more than 100%. If the increase in population is taken into account, the crude rate of increase in cancer cases is 48%, with a 52% increase among men and a 43% increase among women. Cancer mortality in Ireland also increased from 7,500 deaths in 1995 to 9,300 deaths in 2018. The reason is that people are living longer and therefore the rate of cancer in older people is also increasing. With people living longer, more cases of cancer will be identified, which is the reason for the increase in the number of people who have died of cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> It is predicted that cancer rates will increase from 27,000 in 2020 to 42,000 in 2040. We need to put in place mechanisms to identify cancers at a very early stage. One issue relates to prostate cancer and lung cancer. The National Screening Advisory Committee, NSAC, has received 53 submissions over the past 12 months and I understand it will announce and publish details of these submissions and the way forward. We now need to give serious consideration to this matter and be proactive. If we are not doing screening programmes in other areas, we need to identify what the symptoms are because many people end up taking action too late. Dealing with cancers that are far advanced then becomes a difficult challenge for the people caring for these patients. We need major public information campaigns for each of the cancers and the symptoms. When I was reading documentation before raising this matter, issues were identified to me that I was not aware of. I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this proposal.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I thank Deputy Colm Burke for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. The Minister is committed to supporting our national population-based screening programmes. As we all know, screening saves lives and it is important that decisions on the introduction of new screening programmes are made in line with international best practices. As the Deputy may know, decisions about the introduction of new population-based screening programmes in Ireland are made on the advice of the National Screening Advisory Committee. This independent expert committee makes recommendations to the Minister and the Department on population screening in Ireland. As may be appreciated, the assessment of the evidence for making changes to screening programmes is a thorough process done in line with international accepted criteria and with scientific rigour. In addition to the scientific and technological information required to make evidence-based decisions, there are ethical, legal and societal issues which arise when planning enduring population-based programmes of this nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The NSAC works closely with the HSE, HIQA, clinicians and patient advocates in its approach to the consideration of expansion of population-based screening in Ireland. Its first annual call in 2021 for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes received a significant response. As the Deputy correctly stated, a total of 53 submissions were received, including on lung cancer and prostate cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Submissions were received from various sources, including members of the public and patient advocates, and these underwent consideration by the committee at its scheduled meeting during 2022. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> As the Deputy may be aware, under Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, a proposal for an updated Council recommendation was adopted by the Commission in September 2022. The final recommendation is expected to be formally approved by the Council of the European Union in December 2022 and published thereafter. The NSAC will consider the recommendation and advise the Minister and the Department of Health on the evidence as it applies to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> As the Deputy noted, our current programmes have led to the early detection of cancers. The latest cancer trends report, published recently by the National Cancer Registry Ireland, focuses on cancers that are currently screened for. It reports on the incidence, mortality, stage and survival of patients diagnosed with female breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. The report shows the positive impacts of our three cancer screening programmes, namely, BowelScreen, BreastCheck and CervicalCheck, noting that they are effective, that they are detecting cancers earlier and that they are saving lives. The report shows that cancer cases detected through screening were, on average, found at a substantially earlier stage than other cases diagnosed at the same ages. More important, survival has improved for all three cancers, with the greatest improvements seen in the age groups targeted by the national screening programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> In light of all this, I trust the public can be assured of the ongoing commitment of both the Minister and me to the further expansion of population-based screening in Ireland, along with the awareness campaigns the Deputy highlighted.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">I very much look forward to the European Commission publishing its report and the recommendations in that regard. It is important we lead out in respect of those recommendations. I accept there is a cost factor and also an issue with recruiting people to deal with any changes that are brought about, but if we have a screening programme, we will save a great deal of money in the long term. The Minister of State mentioned the three screening programmes that are in operation, and it is important we talk positively about them. There has been much adverse coverage of the way some issues have been managed, but we are getting good results and identifying issues at an earlier stage. The public information aspect is very important, and we should focus in all areas of cancer on the essential signs and the reasons people need to go for checks. I ask that that be taken on board seriously by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> I look forward to the report of the advisory council with a view to going forward with new screening programmes, not least in respect of lung and prostate cancer.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I reiterate that the NSAC will consider the final European Council recommendations on cancer screening and advise the Minister and the Department of Health on the evidence as it applies to Ireland. The NSAC is committed to ensuring the expansion of population-based screening in Ireland in a safe, ethical, robust and evidence-based manner. The introduction of a new population-based screening programme, therefore, can be a lengthy and complex process and can be possible only after a full evidential assessment has been completed against internationally accepted criteria and with scientific rigour. These programmes aim to reduce morbidity and mortality in the population through the early detection of disease and treatment, both of which greatly improve health outcomes. It is important, therefore, to take up the offer of screening, which is free and simple and could save lives. The Minister is committed to the further expansion of screening in accordance with internationally accepted criteria and best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I stress that awareness campaigns are very important, as is the infrastructure in our hospitals to be able to support them. As someone who comes from Galway, where we do not have that infrastructure, I fully concur it is important to have not only screening but also the relevant infrastructure in our A4 hospitals.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">The issue I raise relates to Shannondoc services in north Tipperary. It is a follow-up to a parliamentary question I tabled a couple of weeks ago. In Tipperary, there are three centres, comprising one core centre in Nenagh and regional centres in Thurles and Roscrea. As the Minister of State will know well, given my constituency stretches into her home town of Portumna, the geographical area of north Tipperary is just too large for one core centre to cover efficiently. This is in no way a criticism of the staff of the HSE, who are doing a very good job in Shannondoc providing a service, but it is unfair on the staff and the population of north Tipperary to have just one core centre. Will the Minister of State ask the HSE to make Thurles a core centre as well? The area, which stretches from Lauragh to Gortnahoe, is very large, with a lot of rural countryside. Expecting that one core centre could provide an adequate service for the area is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> The core centre in Nenagh opens from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m., but the two regional centres open only from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., and 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends and public holidays. That is just not providing the cover we need in north Tipperary. I have been contacted by numerous constituents stressing that when they get through to Shannondoc, they do not get a level of service that is satisfactory for patients. It is about the geographical size of north County Tipperary. It is just impractical to expect one core centre to cover the entire county, from Nenagh to Lauragh and Portumna and then back to Gortnahoe, which is a huge area. The fact that just one core centre operates at night in that area means it cannot provide the level of service we rightly expect from Shannondoc. The staff are doing their very best, but if butter is spread too thin, it affects the service that is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I urge the HSE to consider making Thurles a core centre to cover the southern part of north Tipperary. If this improvement were made and the resources put in place, that would greatly impact on the services Shannondoc could provide to north Tipperary. I ask the Minister of State to convey this message to the HSE and urge it to seriously consider providing a second core centre in Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health. Of course, people can become unwell outside of normal GP practice hours and may require urgent GP care, so it is important they have access to out-of-hours GP services when needed. Accordingly, general practitioners who hold general medical services, GMS, contracts for the provision of services to medical card and GP visit card holders are required under their contract to make suitable arrangements for emergencies outside normal practice hours. More than 2,500 GPs currently hold a GMS contract, and while they are not obliged to practise in GP out-of-hours co-operatives to meet their outside-of-practice hours service requirements, most do so. A robust GP out-of-hours services ensures that, insofar as possible, urgent care needs are met in the community and not in a hospital setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> The Shannondoc co-operative provides GP out-of-hours services for Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare. As with the other GP out-of-hours co-operatives, Shannondoc is a private organisation. However, the HSE provides significant funding to support out-of-hours co-operative services through service level agreements, with Shannondoc having received almost €5 million in HSE funding in 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">The HSE is in regular contact with all out-of-hours service providers to ensure that these services continue to meet the needs of their local communities. The HSE has advised that Shannondoc has fully reinstated all services in line with service levels pre-Covid and that service delivery is in line with the service level agreement in place with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Shannondoc has never provided an overnight service from its Thurles treatment centre, which, as the Deputy has said, operates from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. midweek and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. at weekends and on public holidays. Since March 2020, Shannondoc have operated an enhanced model of care with the introduction of mobile doctors, remote doctors and core treatment centre doctors. If a doctor is not present in a regional treatment centre such as the Thurles centre, a mobile doctor, who I hear is based in Nenagh, will be available to patients if required. This model is co-ordinated by dispatchers and nurses. Following triage to identify the immediate needs of the patient, the mobile doctor will attend the patient's preferred treatment centre, where possible, or the patient will be offered an appointment at the nearest available treatment centre. ShannonDoc has confirmed that, where there is increased demand in certain areas, support teams can be deployed from other locations, ensuring services are provided where most needed. </p>
            <p eId="para_31"> Furthermore, alongside an increase in HSE out-of-hours co-operative funding for next year to meet existing levels of service increases, additional funding of €10 million is being made available under the winter plan to support GP practices and out-of-hours services providers over this busy winter period. The HSE has confirmed that, in the near future, Shannondoc services will operate from the new Thurles community primary care centre. It is expected that services will move to this centre by the end of this year and that the existing level of service will be retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> That is the script the Minister has provided to me but, in my experience, going from the bridge in Portumna to Thurles takes one hour and 15 minutes if I drive handily and that is not from the end of the Deputy's county. I cannot imagine what it is like for a patient who is waiting for support. What I am hearing is that we have one main cell in the whole of Tipperary. That is not how Westdoc operates. There are a number of cells, a number of cars and a number of GPs covering the roster. A red-eye shift is provided but there is also weekend cover. I suggest that the Deputy meet with the HSE in his locality and with Shannondoc to see how business cases could be submitted in future to ensure that all cells in his county are covered.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">The last part of the Minister of State's answer showed that she fully understands the issue and the problem in north Tipperary. As she said, we have a brand new primary healthcare centre in Thurles. It was officially opened by the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago. It would be an ideal location for a core centre in the town of Thurles. It is a matter of geography. As the Minister of State said, it is an hour and a quarter from Portumna to Thurles but the north Tipperary region stretches another 15 miles or so beyond Thurles into Gortnahoe and Ballysloe. It is physically impossible to give an adequate service at night-time. From 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., we only have one core centre in north Tipperary. It is just not physically possible to get to patients in ample time no matter how hard the doctors on duty try.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> I will take on board the Minister of State's point about holding negotiations with Shannondoc at the local level to see how its services could be revamped to provide better cover geographically to the whole of north Tipperary. That core centre in Thurles would give the extra resources and would divide north Tipperary into two regions. If that was done, we would be able to adequately cover north Tipperary and provide the night service that people rightly expect and demand of the HSE in modern-day Ireland.</p>

            <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_35">I will conclude with the script. The Government recognises the need for a strong out-of-hours GP service, a key component in the delivery of primary care services. The Government continues to support GPs and out-of-hours providers in their continued provision of GP services. The HSE provides substantial funding to GP out-of-hours co-operatives to help enable them to fulfil their service commitments and care for their patients. This year, almost €5 million in funding has been allocated to Shannondoc through a service level agreement with the HSE's mid-west community healthcare organisation. The HSE has confirmed that Shannondoc has fully reinstated services to their pre-Covid levels. Under the Shannondoc enhanced model of care, where a doctor is not present in a regional treatment centre such as the Thurles centre, a mobile doctor will be available to the patients. Again, from what I have heard, that mobile doctor is based in Nenagh. Shannondoc services will soon operate from the new primary care centre in Thurles.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> From my experience of having recently negotiated a new GP out-of-hours cell for the Ballinasloe area with Westdoc, I know that the nurse support is absolutely fantastic. However, despite all this triage, in eight out of ten cases the patient will still have to see a GP. While the nurse will triage, there is still a requirement to see a GP. It is not enough to have only one GP covering out-of-hours services for the entirety of Tipperary. In Galway alone, we have eight cells. It does not seem adequate for Tipperary to be operating with only one.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I asked to raise this topic today because the Department seems to be unable to properly address the question I put to the Minister before. I will give an example. PAWS Animal Rescue is based in Mullinahone in County Tipperary, my constituency. At the moment, it is looking after greyhounds and lurchers among 13 different breeds of dog. That is just one snapshot in time. Like similar organisations and dog shelters right across the country, it operates on a shoestring budget. The measly grants given to such organisations are just not good enough. Last year, the Department allocated €48,500 towards PAWS Animal Rescue's costs but, as the Minister knows, that goes nowhere near covering the costs of these organisations. To give an example, so far this year, PAWS has paid €147,000 in veterinary bills. It has another outstanding bill of €55,000. The Minister of State can see how the small grant of €48,500 is swallowed up. It goes into its bank account one hour and is gone the next. If the animal welfare grant remains unchanged from last year, it will go into PAWS Animal Rescue's account and then straight back out, as I have said. It is still in debt. That is the extent of what the money will do for it. It appreciates the grants but they are just not adequate, nor do they reflect the extent of the work the organisation does or the cost of doing it.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The Minister of State will have heard that the pressure on animal welfare organisations has been increasing in recent times for various reasons. We are now coming into Christmas and I urge people not to buy pups or other pets for children. If they are looking for something, they should go to these shelters because buying animals will only add more pressure at the end of the Christmas season. The situation at PAWS has been such that it has recently had to close its doors to any new animals being brought in because it just has no room and lacks the funds it needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I asked the Minister a parliamentary question and he responded that "Awards for funding are made on the basis of objective criteria, including the level and type of assistance provided by the organisation in the delivery of care and welfare services to animals and the level of funding raised by organisations from other sources to support welfare activities." I have a number of issues with that response. I was hoping the Minister would be here so that he could tell us what these objective criteria actually are. I hope I will be forgiven for saying that this is hardly appropriate given that the needs of each centre are subject to demand, the needs of dogs that are presented and the range of costs incurred. I would also appreciate if the Minister could give an answer as to precisely how these grant applications are assessed, either through the Minister of State's reply now or in writing later on. That is the question all of these organisations ask me. I am sure they ask other Deputies the same question. I am looking for a detailed response on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The Minister also referred to a programme for Government commitment to provide additional support for animal welfare. While the headline figure of €3.7 million may reflect an increase, I have been informed that 12 rescue centres received no increase in funding this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">For them, the Minister's statement is meaningless. Perhaps the Minister of State will fill us in on that issue and let us know why 12 centres did not receive any funding increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I hope the sentiments expressed at the animal welfare seminar held on 5 October will be reflected in the funding for the coming year. What I expect to happen, however, is that the Department's approach will follow in the same vein as in previous years. Following that seminar, what can these organisations expect in December?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_43">I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue matter. On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, I acknowledge the fantastic effort and commitment of animal welfare organisations and the many volunteers dedicated to the care and welfare of canines, who often operate, as the Deputy said, in challenging and stressful circumstances. Animal welfare charities play a crucial role in helping animals in need, educating people and raising public awareness about improving animal welfare. In many cases, it is more than a job and a career; it is a vocation. The Government thanks all those in the sector for their tremendous efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> Animal welfare is increasingly important to people in Ireland and it a priority for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We are ever more aware of the inter-relationship between the welfare of animals and human well-being. This is reflected in the publication of Ireland's first animal welfare strategy last year titled, Working Together for Animal Welfare: Ireland's Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025. Protecting and enhancing animal welfare standards is the responsibility of everyone in our society, including those who own and care for animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's animal welfare grants programme, referred to by the Deputy, is a clear acknowledgement of the vital work of animal welfare charities. On animal welfare awareness day last December, record animal welfare grant funding of over €3.7 million to 29 animal welfare organisations was announced. Of this funding, €2.7 million, or more than two thirds, was awarded to 68 organisations that deal with the welfare and rehoming of dogs. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, intends to deliver on the programme for Government commitment to further increase the funding allocated via the grants programme in 2022. Further details of these awards will be announced next month. </p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Applications for annual funding from animal welfare organisations are assessed carefully and awards are made on the basis of objective criteria. I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy directly in respect of these criteria. They include the level and type of assistance provided by the organisation in the delivery of care and welfare services to animals and the level of funding raised by organisations from other sources to support welfare activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> As with last year's awards, this year's funding will recognise the importance of education and the dissemination of knowledge to improve animal welfare. Imparting knowledge on animal welfare to society as a whole plays a crucial role in improving standards nationally and is particularly relevant for encouraging responsible pet ownership, which can help reduce the number of dogs abandoned or surrendered to charities. As with all applicants, the organisation in question was assessed under this robust process and criteria and, as the Deputy stated, it was awarded €48,500 last December to assist in funding the care and welfare of animals in 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> I will bring the points the Deputy raised in respect of veterinary bills and the approach of Christmas to the attention of the Minister. I also note that he wishes to know how the grants will be assessed. He also mentioned that 12 centres did not receive any increase in funding. I will raise those matters with the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The organisation in question is mainly involved with the care and rehoming of greyhounds. The Department provides dedicated financial support under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund to Rásaíocht Con Éireann, RCÉ, the statutory body responsible for the operation and regulation of the greyhound industry. Private greyhound rehoming organisations in Ireland may, through RCÉ's registered charity, the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, seek assistance towards costs incurred in the preparation of greyhounds for rehoming. The organisation in question is urged to avail of this funding opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit. I note the Minister of State has been sent in by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and that she is reading from his script. Organisations such as PAWS Animal Rescue throughout the country are struggling big time with funding. As I said, it is already €55,000 in debt to vets after receiving its grants. The Minister of State referred to the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust. Speaking to vets, it is clear that the meagre funding provided for such procedures is not worth the amount of paperwork required. For vets to continue to provide the level of documentation required would cost the organisation more than the value of the funds contributed towards the procedure in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> It is easy to say that that funding is being provided but, as I said, we are a couple of weeks away from Christmas. In January and February, we will see another increase in unwanted pets which were bought as Christmas presents and have been rejected afterwards. If centres such as PAWS Rescue Centre have already closed their doors, what will things be like come February, March and April? I appreciate the Minister will provide animal welfare grants on 8 December. I remind him that he stood before many small animal welfare groups in early October and told them how much he respected their work. Unfortunately, he did not respect them enough to send out invitations to more than just a few of them to attend the announcement on 8 December. Perhaps this might be an oversight on the part of the Department but the Minister has plenty of time to send out invitations to some of the smaller groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> I appreciate that the Minister of State has come to the House to answer some of my questions. I ask that she relay to the Minister some of the concerns I have raised, which need to addressed quickly. Organisations such as PAWS Animal Rescue, which is already €55,000 in debt, also need to be assisted.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">It is also important to note that the programme for Government includes a commitment to promote responsible pet ownership. In speaking about the period after Christmas, the Deputy makes a valid point. This commitment is being advanced by cross-divisional co-ordination within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on various aspects relating to pet ownership. A multi-stakeholder council, the advisory council on companion animal welfare, has met on three occasions this year already. It includes non-governmental organisations, individuals and professionals with a diverse range of skill sets and expertise and is to advise the Minister on matters relating to companion animals. The council will continue to provide him with expert advice on companion animal issues, including guidance on policymaking regarding the welfare of canines.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The Minister has asked me to make it known that he strongly acknowledges the work of the dedicated officials in his Department on animal welfare and the authorised officers in other organisations with whom they frequently co-operate, including An Garda Síochána, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, and customs officials, in enforcing animal welfare legislation. The Government will continue to place the highest priority on animal welfare. I commend again the tremendous work done by those who work for charities.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> As I mentioned, the Minister intends to deliver on the programme for Government commitment to further increase the funding allocated via the grants programme in 2022. Further details of these awards will be announced next month. I will take the various points the Deputy made in his contribution back to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. If they have any outstanding queries, I am sure they will revert to the Deputy in respect of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I thank the Minister of State for attending. This is the fourth time I have raised a Topical Issue matter on boil water notices in east Cork. Many Deputies are lucky to be able to raise four Topical Issue matters in one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I want to paint a picture by referring to recent newspaper headlines, including in the<i> Irish Examiner</i>: "Urgent boil water notice issued for Whitegate area of Cork after 'inadequate disinfection' at plant" is a headline from February 2020. The headline, "Numbers affected by long-term by boilwater notices double by year's end", appeared in May 2022, while the headline, "Thousands affected by new boil water notice", appeared in October 2022. These refer only to the Whitegate area in east Cork. Another piece - I believe it was in <i>corkbeo.ie</i> - was headlined "'It’s horrendous’: Cork villagers count the cost of creaky water system".</p>
            <p eId="para_58">That was in October 2022 in Killavullen in north Cork. The areas I am talking about here are Aghada, Churchtown, Ballycotton, Saleen, Shanagarry, Ballinacurra and areas of Cloyne. It is nearly from Whitegate oil refinery all the way over towards Youghal. It is a very rural area.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Every time there has been a boil water notice in east Cork, I have been on to Irish Water. I remember one particular letter I received, which definitely came from an elderly person. It came in an envelope but the letter was written on the back of another envelope inside it. It is was pleading with me to get Irish Water to sort this out because it was costing them an awful lot of money. In Churchtown, which is a very rural area, there is a very large care home. It costs a lot of money to go to the shops to buy water. While others were speaking earlier, a woman has already been on to me to say that this will be her second Christmas having to boil water. I have asked Irish Water to put in tankers or at least have something. If it has a duty to supply proper drinking water and is responsible for the quality of water in the area, surely it can supply something that would not be at a cost to the people who use these services. The frustration there is very clear. A family were in touch with me with a young autistic child who cannot fathom how they are supposed to take a bottle of water into the bathroom in the morning when they go to brush their teeth. It is taking normality out of some families' lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> I think this has been ongoing for nearly three years. Some 9,500 people - the bones of 10,000 people - are affected. Every time we go to Irish Water, we are told it is a question of turbidity in the water. It has had three to four years to build a higher wall around this plant. I know it is working on a plant but the worrying thing is that it does not seem to be forward planning for capacity issues. East Cork probably has the fasting growing population in the country. It is a disgrace that Irish Water is putting a treatment plant in White Bay. It is called White Bay for a reason; because it is a beautiful white beach. The treatment plant that it is putting there certainly will not meet future capacity and will not put clean water back into the bay. It is really frustrating.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> I speak on behalf of the people I represent in east Cork. I will not use choice words but the Minister of State will know what I would like to say in here: they are very something-ed off about it. It is very frustrating for me as a public representative to have to come in here and make the case to a Minister of State because Irish Water will not engage. When it does, it is dismissive. The least it can do is to supply free drinking water to the nearly 10,000 residents in east Cork, and those in Killavullen in north Cork, so that they can have some bit of normality. Things are getting very expensive here and to have the added stress of going to draw water is just driving people mad.</p>

          <speech by="#JosephaMadigan" eId="spk_16" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education">
            <from>Deputy Josepha Madigan<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_62">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I am taking the question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. This is an issue of national and local importance. I appreciate the Deputy's concerns for communities affected by boil water notices. I can hear his frustration on behalf of his constituents.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of Whitegate regional public water supply is a matter for Irish Water. I know he has had engagements with it. Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. In turn, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as environmental regulator is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for the provision of drinking water. I understand from inquiries made with Irish Water that the boil water notice currently in place for the Whitegate public water supply was issued on 29 October 2022 following consultation between Irish Water, Cork County Council and the HSE. This boil water notice was issued to protect approximately 9,500 customers in Whitegate, Aghada, Churchtown, Ballycotton, Saleen, Shanagarry, Ballinacurra and areas of Cloyne. The notice was issued as a result of increased turbidity in the raw water, which can happen at this source as it is susceptible to raw water quality issues after rainfall events. Boil water notices have been issued for the Whitegate public water supply on a number of occasions in recent years, as the Deputy mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> In the short term, upgrade works to the filters are under way and additional parts are on order, with delivery expected by the end of December. Following the implementation of these measures, the HSE will be asked to confirm that the criteria for lifting the boil water notice are met. The delivery of a new water treatment plant, as the permanent solution to the issues at Whitegate, is under way. I know the Deputy is aware of that. Irish Water is in the process of preparing an application for planning permission and engagement with prospective contractors has commenced. It is envisaged that the planning application will be lodged in the first quarter of 2023. Subject to the planning permission being granted by July 2023, the construction contract will be signed in the fourth quarter of 2023 with construction mobilised in the first quarter of 2024. The construction work would be due for completion in the last quarter of 2025. The information and data that are necessary to demonstrate that the new plant meets all applicable standards will be submitted to the EPA for its consideration for removal of the plant from the remedial action list.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> The priority of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for all consumers. We all want to see this notice lifted without undue delay, but only when the HSE and the EPA have confirmed the water supply is safe. Both our water and wastewater systems require substantial and sustained investment to bring the systems up to the quality and resilience standards required of a modem service, to provide for population growth and to build resilience in the face of climate change. As part of budget 2023, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, secured funding of over €1.65 billion to support water services. This includes €1.56 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services; support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland; and support a range of programmes aimed at delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area, thereby making a significant contribution to addressing Ireland's needs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Buckley<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_66">The public water supply is a matter for Irish Water. If it will not work with us or facilitate people, who do we go to? That is the problem. The response mentioned 2025. We are in 2022 so that is another three years of people buying water, drawing water and enduring frustration. I appeal to Irish Water to get its finger out and start forward planning to help these people. It is extremely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> I was amused by the mention of filters in the response. When I raised this before - I think it was in May - the problem of accessing these filters was mentioned. I said it then and I will say it again that they probably would have a better chance of getting these filters more quickly from <i>wish.com</i>. I get the same response every time I raise this matter during a Topical Issue debate. It feels like there is incompetence in Irish Water. I worked in construction. If you are a foreman, you have responsibilities, like in any job. Why is it so difficult to organise something properly or plan forward properly? The issue is here. If there is a chance of resolving it, it will not be before the end of 2025. I will probably be back here asking why Irish Water is not supplying clean drinking water to the 9,500 people on the Whitegate scheme and a couple of hundred people, or maybe more, on the Killavullen scheme. People in both areas have businesses, pubs and restaurants. It will be very hard for them to survive. It is a question of incompetence. They knew what was happening two or three years ago. Every time it rains in Ireland, we cannot drink our water. It does not make sense. When I was a young fellow, a long time ago, we used to draw a bucket of water from the barrel and use it for cooking and washing and it was never an issue. I appeal to Irish Water to sort it out. To have 9,500 people with no water for the next three years is absolutely ludicrous.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">I will stand corrected if I am wrong about this, but my understanding from the briefing I have been given is that the upgrade works to the filters is under way and additional parts are on order. </p>
            <p eId="para_69">Delivery is expected by the end of December. Following the implementation of these measures, the HSE will be asked to confirm that the criteria for lifting the boil water notice are met. If that is the case, the date will not be 2025, but much sooner. It appears from my briefing note that it is the water treatment plant that will be fully constructed at the end of 2025, but the boil water notice should be lifted way before that, hopefully early next year if not at the end of December.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> The Minister wants to acknowledge the patience and co-operation of affected residents and businesses in the Whitegate area and other areas. I note the Deputy said that when Irish Water engages with him, it is "dismissive". It is a matter that I will bring to the attention of the Minister because we want all agencies to co-operate and at least give information when needed, particularly when one is trying to represent constituents who have to pay for water. The Deputy mentioned an autistic child who has to get bottled water to brush their teeth. That is not ideal for any family. I appreciate the pressure the Deputy is under in representing his constituents and I will relay his comments to the Minister. I thank him for his contribution.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_20" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_113">Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_114">That is good news, so we might be able to talk about how the motion will be implemented. The motion arises from the latest OECD report, Redesigning Ireland's Transport for Net Zero: Towards Systems that Work for People and the Planet, which I am sure the Minister has read. I have read it. It is just one in a series of reports issued nationally and internationally of which the Minister is very well aware. We have been told repeatedly, by bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in Ireland and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that we will not meet our emissions targets with current policies. The OECD report shines a spotlight on the policies the Government is pushing. It informs us that, with our existing policies, we will not meet our target of reducing emissions. Specifically, it states that "a systemic approach is needed for Ireland to meet its ambitious climate targets and improve well-being".</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> This motion has national and regional significance but focuses on Galway because it is one of the five cities destined to grow. As the Minister knows, Galway is absolutely choked with traffic. We have had policy after policy on this. All the reports I have from 1999, starting with the Buchanan land use and transportation study, would reach the ceiling in my office. We have a traffic crisis. What is the OECD report telling us specifically when it shines the light on policies? It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_116">Policy rarely focuses on improving the structure of systems by redesigning or transforming them. Instead, most policies focus on improving specific parts of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Therefore, we keep tinkering with the system and changing little bits. The example highlighted in the report is that 67% of emission reductions in Ireland are expected to come from developing better vehicles and fuels. In this regard, it states, "Ireland's current sub-targets assign excessive weight to vehicle and fuel replacement, expecting this to account for 67% of the transport sector emission reductions". It claims this cannot happen, for many reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> The core message is that transformative change is needed, but needed urgently. Over and over, this message is repeated in the report, which amounts to over 100 pages. Achieving Ireland's ambitious climate target of a 50% reduction by 2030 relative to 2018 requires transformative change. The report describes what transformative change is. Before it was published, the IPCC defined transformative change as "a system-wide change that requires more than technological change through consideration of social and economic factors". Those social and economic factors had never been taken into account. They were certainly never taken into account in respect of the outer bypass in Galway. We are being asked to review targets urgently and redefine success, which is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> A substantial proportion of the report is devoted to car dependency. It finds that Ireland has a car-dependent transport system that is unfit to help the country to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. It states, "Current mobility patterns in Ireland show that three out of four citizens, on average, opt to travel by car on a daily basis". I find the report comforting in that it asks us not to blame the motorist or others who use cars, because the system has failed. I am paraphrasing in saying the system has utterly failed motorists and others in Ireland by not giving them choices. Despite the lack of choice, we continue with policies that focus primarily on changing the behaviour of the motorist or person on the ground as opposed to the model.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> To meet the 2030 climate target for transport electrification, electrification is necessary but insufficient. In this regard, the report argues that "rapid reductions in travel demand and shifts to sustainable modes are needed". Page 100 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_121">Because the car-dependent system is also at the source of many other negative impacts, refocusing efforts to shift away from car dependency is also an opportunity for Ireland to align its climate and wider well-being agendas.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Over and over, a key message is refocusing efforts towards transformative change. We need to shift from the car-centric system, which involves breaking the link between economic growth and car usage. I find this particularly significant. If we want to consider how car-centric we are and the lobbying pressure, we need only consider what is spent on advertising per year to sell cars. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_123">The automobile industry spends between 400 and 600 euros per car sold on advertising ... With approximately 105 000 cars sold in Ireland in 2021, a rough estimate is that investment in car-centric advertising amounted to approximately 50 million euros for the year. By contrast, the Irish government estimates that spending on communication promoting sustainable transport modes [not to mention providing them] will amount to 6 to 7 million euros [per year] ...</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The key, of course, is to move away from blaming the motorist, pedestrian or cyclist. Today, staff and many others travelled to the Houses using public transport that is, notwithstanding the improvements made, very difficult to rely on. This report points out that the policies pursued by various Governments have significantly shaped current systems. As they have shaped the bad systems, they have, if they change, the potential to redesign proper, sustainable policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The report stated that Government policies have been fundamental to shaping current systems and they will also be fundamental to moving forward. It continues, "Focusing climate action on redesigning systems can provide opportunities for a just transition and for a more just system in the end." There is enormous amount of untapped potential for systems innovation in Ireland. These opportunities will not only improve well-being but will also result in lower energy and materials consumption and fewer emissions. I give all that by way of policy. Those are only some of the issues identified in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I will relate that now to Galway city and the wider region. When I speak about Galway city and the problems and solutions, we cannot deal with problems and solutions without looking at the wider region and, in particular, the western railway corridor, which I am sure Deputy Canney and other Deputies will be talking about. I want to pay tribute to Dr. Bradley for his report, about which unfortunate comments were made at the time. It is an absolute necessity to have the western rail corridor up and running if we are seriously interested in balanced regional development, especially given that the north-west region was demoted less than a month or two ago by the relevant European body. That is an essential. The part that is functioning has functioned extremely well, notwithstanding some teething problems and possible flooding issues. The usage of the railway line between Ennis and Limerick has surprised us all. I do not hear the voices in Dublin that were condemnatory of the waste of money now coming forward and saying that this is wonderful, that they were wrong and that they need to look at it. There is nothing like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> In this report, the OECD acknowledges that steps have been taken by this Government in the sustainable mobility plan. However, it highlights issues in that regard as well and emphasises the need to build on it. That approach is still focusing on the individual, as opposed to the overall policies that we need to change. The report particularly captures that on page 13, which refers to corporate responsibility. It states, “Systems could be deliberately redesigned to promote and facilitate other choices and trigger large-scale behavioural change which is otherwise unlikely.” It is otherwise unlikely without those fundamental changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> Going back to Galway in the time that I have left, I cannot express the sense of frustration that motorists and people in Galway feel with the traffic congestion. As an elected Member since 1999, I could line up the reports from the floor to the ceiling – without exaggeration – in relation to putting all our eggs in the one basket of an outer bypass. Regardless of our opinion on that, and accepting that I might be in a minority, the point is we are now at the situation where An Bord Pleanála has agreed that the order should be quashed. We are in a limbo situation as to what will happen next. Will it go back to An Bord Pleanála or will it go back to scratch? What do we do? What have we done since 1999? We have waited for the elusive pimpernel of the outer bypass, and changed to the N6 project that will not materialise. The Minister knows that and what we need to do if we are seriously interested in implementing the climate action plan and all of the other policies. </p>
          <p eId="para_129"> I refer back to Galway city. We have had no feasibility study on light rail. I have forgotten which year 24,000 people put their names to a petition to say, at the very least, that there should be a feasibility study on light rail. I see one of the plans – I forget which one – “considering” it. It such a weak word. We need a feasibility study on light and very light rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> We need urgency in relation to the rolling out of park and ride. It has not happened. I have told the Minister it is in the plan since 2005. I believe there is no management will to run that out. They are constantly waiting for the road before anything is done. I acknowledge some of the improvements that have been made but, unfortunately, there has been no transformational change. As the Minister knows, Galway is one of the five cities destined to grow and increase its population by 50%. Yet, there is no overall plan for the common good in Galway. We have a city development plan but we have no overall plan for the common good based around public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> Arup was given the brief to look at the N6 project. It was not given a brief to look at public transport and solve our problems through a myriad of solutions other than the outer bypass. I specifically asked Arup staff that question and they said they would have been delighted to do that, had they been given that brief. Subsequent to this, public transport was added on.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Rail services in Galway have never been used to their full potential. We are talking about an extra loop from Athenry to Galway to allow that to develop. This should all have been done, and now that it is not done, it should be number one on the Government’s agenda with a timeframe for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> The response of the county manager and the city manager to the decision to quash the outer bypass N6 project is profoundly concerning to me. They said they were disappointed that it was refused on such a narrow ground. Does the Minister know what the narrow ground was? They failed to consider climate change. According to our management and leadership, that is a narrow ground and they are disappointed about that. If that does not bring into acute focus the failure to appreciate what climate change obligations require us to do, I do not know what else will. In that sense, the Government needs to take action. There is a need to designate Galway as a pilot project - or any other phrase that the Minister might like to use - with a view to rolling out a comprehensive, integrated public transport system that is embedded in a western rail corridor.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> We need to develop a road for Connemara. There was progress on that lately in relation to saying it could now go ahead as a stand-alone project in terms of a feasibility study. Up to now, it was completely tied to a road that was going nowhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I appeal to the Minister. This is a golden opportunity. Rather than a disaster, the quashing of the N6 is a golden opportunity to focus on what needs to be done in Galway to make it a green and thriving city and to allow people to travel sustainably.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">I do not think that it will come as a surprise to anyone that the 2022 OECD report has found that our current mobility patterns, that is, the movement of goods and people, are incompatible with our greenhouse gas emission targets. The report quite correctly pours cold water on any notion that simply converting to electric vehicles, EVs, will achieve the necessary reduction in admissions; it will not. Even if all vehicles on our roads were electrically powered, there would be trade-offs. There would be a huge increase in demand for electricity, which would make the target of meeting our electricity needs from sustainable environmentally friendly sources much more difficult. Vehicle batteries require lithium. Mining for lithium is water-intensive and contributes to air, soil and water pollution. It is also a key factor in armed conflicts in central Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I understand that the Minister will reduce the target of 1 million EVs, which was never going to be reached anyway. They are simply unaffordable for the vast majority of people. What is needed, as the OECD report states, is a transformation in the mindset as to how we plan for where people live, how they get to work, school, shopping, essential services and social activities and how the goods they need are transported. Above all, we need an end to the dependence on private cars. Three out of every four people in Ireland today use a car for their transport needs, often travelling alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The statistics speak for themselves. The transport sector has seen the fastest growth in emissions over any other sector in the past 50 years. It relies on oil for 92% of its energy use and is responsible for 42% of energy-related CO2 emissions. Car dependency has been facilitated by successive Governments closing down rail lines and train stations, extremely low investment in public transport and low subsidies where transport actually exists. The situation needs to be urgently transformed. In 2021, both public and private bus and coach transport accounted for only 3% of journeys and rail was less than 1%. Public transport should be free to provide a real incentive to get people out of their cars. </p>
          <p eId="para_139">Free public transport is also needed for those who cannot afford a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Alongside making public transport free, we need investment by the State on a serious scale to have a fully connected intermodal public transport system. Free public transport is not an incentive if it does not exist where you live. A fully connected intermodal system means buses, light rail, safe walking, safe cycling and other slow transport modes. It would connect rural areas to main towns and <i>vice versa</i>. It needs to meet local needs, which means real communication with local communities, not the top-down pretence of consultation we saw with BusConnects, which is commonly referred to in Dublin as "BusDisconnects". Closed train lines and stations should be brought back into use. The new public transport system needs to use only sustainable fuels. This means 100% electric or green hydrogen for buses, coaches, rail and light rail. Taxi services should be made electric within a certain framework and plan, with assistance in the form of grants. We need to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of fossil fuel heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in the movement of goods and we should plan for a series of cargo hubs serviced by rail to reduce road use. There is a need for a national plan for the movement of goods, involving consultation with stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Our spatial planning system needs a transformative overhaul. We need to end urban sprawl in our cities and long journeys from commuter belts to work or to avail of essential services. We need a national plan for economic growth at regional levels. To increase the numbers living and working in towns, we need to encourage people in rural areas to live in larger villages with good access to public transport for work and essential services like schools. Such a transformation of our transport system is a tall order but these transformative changes in the way our economies and societies function are necessary if we are to have any hope of reducing, let alone eliminating, the drastic consequences of climate change. In this debate we are dealing with transport but a transformative approach to transport to reduce dependency on private cars and elevate public transport has to be part of an overall transformative movement. This will not come from the likes of COP27, which is yet another failure to deal with the issues. Greenwashing and fiddling about the edges is a road to disaster. We have to end the endless pursuit of growth on a planet with finite resources to simply satisfy the need or greed for profit of the 1%. We must move to a system of a democratic planning to use these resources for the needs of the people. Such a movement will only come from below.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_144">Má thagann sé, mar a dúirt an Cathaoirleach Gníomhach. The Government will not oppose this motion because we agree with the central argument set out in Deputy Connolly's speech. The OECD report she refers to is exactly right in that it is system change we need, rather than just tinkering with measures within it. This is a useful opportunity to consider that and to consider how it might apply in Galway if we take it as an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> On decarbonisation, we have to halve our emissions in this decade and reach net zero in three decades. We are in the middle of reviewing the climate action plan and about to publish the next iteration of it and it seems to me that transport will be the most challenging sector to reduce emissions in. In each of the other sectors, such as energy or agriculture, there is a clear economic opportunity and new technological developments which give us the capacity to reduce emissions in a way that is not as difficult as in transport, where we are going against 50 to 60 years of transport patterns set in place by a transport system that prioritised, as the Deputy says, a car-based private transport system. That is not in any way to criticise anyone who is driving. This will not work if it is a case of pointing the finger and engaging in recriminations but it is a reality that we have created a dispersed and car-dependent model in our transport system. It is no longer fit for purpose, neither in climate emissions nor in good transport planning, because when everyone drives, gridlock arises and that works for no one.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> We need to change and to halve our emissions in this decade. In acknowledging that in our programme for Government, the Government clearly set out key system changes that will help us to deliver that change. The first change is a commitment to a 2:1 ratio in new public transport versus new roads. It is taking time to get up to that ratio. It will take a number of years because it takes time for anything to get through our planning system, which means major public transport projects are delayed. However, we are committed to that and it is an important part of the ask. Second, we must commit 20% of the capital budget to active travel, including walking and cycling. We are on target for that, we spent that ratio this year and we are seeing a huge pick-up in the ability of the local authorities to look at devising new projects for same. A third element of the Government's strategy is in the national development plan, where we recognise that we need better balanced regional development, low-carbon development and compact development, in housing as well as in transport. Again I would have to say that if you look at the reality of what is happening on the ground, that is not being delivered. Half of the housing in the country is still in the greater Dublin area and we need better balanced regional development. We need to do that by investing in public transport in rural areas and in our cities outside of Dublin in particular, and that is starting to happen. We are building the metropolitan rail in Cork, we are seeing the start of works to reopen the Foynes line in Limerick and there was a major investment decision two weeks ago in Waterford. There is development but Galway needs to be part of that solution, perhaps more than any other city or county, because I agree with Deputy Connolly that it has perhaps some of the worst traffic problems in our country for a variety of different local reasons which we can go into here and now.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Our sustainable mobility policy is in line with what the OECD report is saying and the national investment framework for transport backs up what the report says. Those policies state that the first priority is active travel, the second is public transport and it is only if you cannot meet your transport needs at that point that you might look at private transport solutions that are car-based with road investment and so on. Critically, there is a hierarchy in investment such that you have to use existing assets first and foremost and look to see if you can optimise the use of existing assets before you make investment in new infrastructure. I want to use that framework to consider what is happening in Galway and as an example of what we need to do there. The Deputy referred to the decision of An Bord Pleanála, which is welcome to my mind, and which recognised that no one can ignore the climate plans. The Deputy referred to Galway City Council and Galway County Council saying that it was a minor issue or a small issue, but in law they now have to devise a local climate action plan that matches what the Government will be doing. It is not just the Government; it is in European law and it will be strengthened. Galway City Council and Galway County Council cannot ignore climate change and they have to start addressing transport plans that are part of the solution. As the Deputy has said, this may provide us with an opportunity to change tack and deliver some of the system change that would make Galway city thrive as a green, efficient and successful city. To do that, we need to accelerate BusConnects in Galway, as we need to do in other cities. The new network will go to consultation in the first quarter of next year and the real question is how quickly we can deliver it because we have seen in Dublin and other cities where we have looked to introduce BusConnects that it takes too long; it takes up to ten years. What can we bring that down to?</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I am encouraged that one of our pathfinder projects, which is designed to try to accelerate what we are doing, is the cross-link project in Galway. I know it has only just gone into planning in September so how quickly it can get through An Bord Pleanála is probably one of the key issues that will decide our success or otherwise. However, I am encouraged that there has been a start to the work on the Salmon Weir Bridge and that quite advanced work has also been done on the Dublin Road. That might provide us with the first significant public transport spine that will allow us to start changing the way the city works. It will not be easy and it will require political courage because it is disruptive but I do not see any alternative in how we solve the problems. As part of the updated metropolitan area strategy, which is due to come for Galway, I commit that we will look at light rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">We will look in real detail at how could we take that cross-city link and fundamental upgrade in public transport in the city and start developing the demand for public transport services that then allows it to evolve and develop into one of the light rail routes that would be successful in the city. I recognise there have also been significant developments in Galway. There is a new hybrid bus fleet there, which is starting as part of the solutions for this decarbonisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> With regard to the investment in rail - I am sure Deputy Canney will be interested in this - the critical next step is the publication of the all-island rail review. It has been delayed, unfortunately, because we do not have an Executive in the North. When that arises, hopefully, sooner rather than later, it will provide an opportunity for transformative system change to how we use our rail system, seeing as, for example, the reopening of the Foynes lines, which now we are starting with the civil works, could be part, as I said, of a wider sense of what the western rail corridor is. The corridor is not only from Athenry to Claremorris. In my mind, it is from Ballina to Waterford, and using the underutilised rail lines from Waterford to Limerick, and then with new connections to our ports, starts to give the opportunity for industrial development for freight capacity, and passenger services then following when we start to reopen the lines and start to make them work. That is significant but we must await the final publication of the rail review.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> In the meantime, we will invest in that passing loop Deputy Connolly mentioned in Oranmore station and in the second platform there, footbridge, etc. We will invest in Ceannt Station, in upgrading the station, putting in new platforms, putting a new waiting infrastructure, etc., because it is critical as part of the compact development of Galway that we have people living in the centre of the city around that station so that we reduce the overall volume of transport needs rather than merely look to make the switch.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I am conscious, unfortunately, of time. We had a good debate here in recent weeks on the issue of park and ride in Galway. The Galway City Council draft strategy was set out on 10 October. We need those bus-based park-and-ride sites. The three of them were set out in that strategic plan as well as an upgrade of the park-and-ride facilities at Oranmore railway station.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I regret that Deputy Ó Cuív is not able to join me on this although I am sure he may contribute later.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The need for the upgrade now of the Galway transport strategy which is due for review this year gives us the opportunity to look at a new way of how we do transport in Galway and to accelerate those sustainable modes that we know we will need. It will require, first and foremost, real leadership from the local authorities in both Galway city and county. We will support that and back it up in every way we can. The national policies complement what they have to do. Collectively, we need to change tack and deliver the system change Deputy Connolly refers to in her motion which is why we agree with it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_155">I thank Deputy Connolly for her timely and comprehensive motion on a new vision for transport in Galway and other areas. I was happy to sign the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> While the proposals put forward in the motion largely relate to Galway city and county, nonetheless many of these proposals can in principle be applied to other areas throughout the country. That is one aspect I appreciate about the motion. In principle, these proposals can be applied at a national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The motion is timely because it is in the shadow of COP27, where we all heard the stark warnings of being on the highway to hell with our foot on the accelerator. Many of the proposals in the motion could allow us to take our foot off the accelerator and to use public transport instead of continuing with our car-dependent ways. However, for this to happen public transport must be accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Accessible means availability. There must be sufficient and reliable bus routes for people to use. The Minister will be aware that while things have improved, it was a significant concern for many people over the past few months that buses did not always turn up. Somebody going to or coming from work early in the morning or late at night, going for appointments, going about their business or whatever has to be able to rely on public transport because, especially in rural areas, it is not the situation that if someone misses a bus, there will be another one coming or if a bus does not turn up, another one will arrive within ten, 15 or 20 minutes. Often someone will have to wait two to three hours for another bus to arrive. If those buses do not turn up for whatever reason, because it makes little difference when someone is standing at the bus stop, the truth is people will simply stop using public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Accessibility is not only about availability; it is also about cost. I recognise that efforts have been made to decrease the cost of public transport and I would be fully supportive of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Accessibility is also about universal accessibility. That, of course, includes all persons with a disability. Sometimes when we think of disability, we only think of somebody perhaps in a wheelchair but disability is much wider than that and, as our population ages, more people will have some form of disability. It is important that our public transport fleet is designed in such a way that it caters for all levels of disability. That is bottom-line stuff.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Coming back to the motion, one of the proposals that I was interested to see is the recognition that Galway city has launched an application to the European Commission to become a net-zero pilot city and if it were successful, it would receive funding to implement innovative approaches to carbon reduction over a two-year pilot programme. This is an EU initiative. I hope that other cities across Ireland have applied to join this initiative because this would allow local authorities to try out different approaches, to put alternative strategies in place and to see what works best because not everything will be 100% successful. That is what innovation is. We try out to see what is best for a city or town. This kind of initiative gives local authorities flexibility to see whether certain proposals work well in their city. It is a great opportunity, as I said, for other Irish cities to try this approach and I sincerely hope that many others have applied to join this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I am also pleased that the motion reiterates the fact that a key message from the OECD report is that refocusing efforts on transformative policies is not restricted to urban areas because one third of Ireland's population is rural. We are all aware that more people are moving out of the larger cities. It is not only due to the trend of working from home but also the cost of living in our cities is becoming prohibitive. That means rural transport services must serve all those rural areas. I am pleased that I can see a real start in providing rural transport in parts of counties Leitrim and Sligo. It is a good start. Many people are happy to see that. It refocuses how people think.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I look forward to seeing a further roll-out of these services. The Minister spoke about balanced regional development. This is a crucial part of a balance of development in regions. People have to be able to get from A to B. Reliable, accessible and affordable public transport is very much part of this package.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> In this context, while I have the floor and the Minister is sitting in front of me, I want to speak specifically about a new bus route that is being rolled out in Sligo. I am referring to the old S3 route, which is now called the 981 route. It goes from Coolaney in Sligo through Sligo town to St. Angela's College. I have contacted the Minister on a number of occasions about this. I have asked that Maugheraboy, which is an area of Sligo town, be included on the route. The press release announcing the route included Maugheraboy but now this does not seem to be the case. I do not know why it is no longer included.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> This morning I received a response to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister's office on this issue. I have been told it has been referred to the NTA. I do not know how well the Minister knows Sligo Town. He does not need to know it well to know that if one section of a town is not served by public transport it is a major issue for people. I know there is huge disappointment in the Maugheraboy area that this part of the town has been left without a bus service. While I accept the Minister's response that it was being referred to the NTA, I strongly ask that he asks why this is the case so the authority is fully aware of the level of disappointment. Even at this late stage some minor change in the route might be possible. This is all that is needed. We are not speaking about major changes. Any change made would not discommode other areas. We have a relatively simple solution. If there are challenges and reasons the bus route is not serving the community in Maugheraboy, I would like to know why this is and what will be done to ensure this community is fully serviced. I am asking for the Minister's help on this. I will be in contact with him again.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> He mentioned the western rail corridor and that it was to go from Ballina to Waterford. He did not mention Sligo. I am not sure what is in his mind. Perhaps he might clarify this for me. To my knowledge at least, it was always the case that Sligo was very much included in the western rail corridor. People may be surprised and disappointed if this is not the case. I suspect it probably is. Perhaps the Minister might be able to clarify this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the motion and I thank the Independent Group. It chimes very well with the demands regarding the environment and climate and the needs of communities to deliver sustainable transport with a particular focus on public and active travel. There is growing recognition that we need system change rather than to push on individual behaviours. We need a scale of change that we have not seen previously. This requires the institutions of the State and its agencies to get their houses in order and have the focus and energy and strategy to deliver on systemic change.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I support the proposition that Galway act as a pilot. There is much in the motion pointing towards very sensible proposals on park and ride, rail and other mobility methods. The point made by Deputy Harkin is fair. There are principles that can be applied not only in Galway but throughout the State. In our alternative proposal Sinn Féin recognises there are significant opportunities for the State to lead and apply the principle of build-it-and-they-will-come and the principle that when public transport alternatives are there for people and they are accessible, affordable and reliable, people will use them. We do not have to imagine this as a scenario. We see it here and we certainly see it internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> We have called on the Government to take a number of measures to realise this. In our alternative budget we called for the reduction of 20% on fares to be made permanent and to extend that to commercial bus operators. We called for a public transport fare reduction of 50% for those aged under 18 and that fares would be made free for those aged under 18 over two years. We called for the expanded roll-out of Connecting Ireland. It is a good plan from the NTA that would see improved bus services for populations of more than 300. The funding commitment is not yet there from the Government. We know the targets for the first year, which is 2022, are being missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> We have called for an extension of the short hop zones. These are particularly relevant in the commuter belt area around Dublin. We have called for investment in the western rail corridor and the Navan rail project, extending beyond what the Government is doing in the national development plan. These two critical pieces of rail infrastructure would deliver 2.375 million sustainable journeys on an annual basis. We have called for increased investment in accessibility for people with disabilities and increased investment in the public transport accessibility retrofit programme. There is a plan and there are particular challenges with our coach network. This needs to be advanced at a pace. We have called for a dedicated public transport policing unit to ensure people can feel safe on public transport, whether they be passengers or workers. We have called for increased investment in our school bus transport scheme services and fleet. This is to ensure school bus transport would be widely available, we would not refuse thousands of children every year and the buses would be up to standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I want to touch on how the principles and motion might apply to my county of Meath. We need investment in the Navan rail project. I know from the response to a parliamentary question that I received this morning from the NTA that the greater Dublin area transport strategy is with the Minister. He needs to sign off so the ball can get rolling on the Navan rail project. Funding needs to be allocated to the project. If Sinn Féin were in government, the project would start now and not after 2031 as the Government intends. We need an improvement in services in County Meath. In the past 24 hours, scores of people were waiting at bus stops for the 105X, 103 and NX. This is not acceptable and it needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Connecting Ireland needs to be rolled out and expanded. Of course the hot topic of the day is incentives for people when the alternatives are not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">We have tolls in Meath, where there is a double toll on the M3. Drivers have to pay two tolls to get from Kells to Dublin. There is also a toll on the M1, which has an impact on the behaviour of drivers on that road. We have congestion every morning, which people will be familiar with if they listen to traffic reports. Kilmoon Cross is famous for traffic jams in part because traffic diverts off the M1 to avoid the toll. I call on the Minister of State to ensure the toll increases do not take effect at the start of January.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">Galway city traffic has been an issue for as long as I can remember and it does reputational damage to the City, nationally and internationally. When a person mentions they are from Galway, it is often the butt of a joke. As Galwegians, we know when traffic will be worse and we always factor that into our daily commute. While reputational damage is frustrating, what is really frustrating for those people is the real-life impact on their lives as a result of the traffic. For a person living on one side of the city and working on the other, the lack of public transport options, particularly the lack of direct links across the city, is truly shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Other elected representatives and I have long been calling for more frequent bus services, particularly at peak times, affordable fares and a modern and more efficient approach to ticketing. Four weeks ago, I talked in this Chamber about university students living in Connemara because of the lack of affordable or, indeed, any accommodation in Galway city, who are missing morning lectures as there is no bus that will get them in on time. We do not have a suitable and effective public transport system in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I have heard reports from the east and west of the county, as well as from the city, of people being left on the side of the road because buses were full. Another issue we have is that those bus stops are often not suitable or sufficient for modern-day Ireland. We know it will rain and we know people will be waiting at bus stops, but we do not have proper protection for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> People in Galway see announcement after announcement about new night services on bus routes in Galway, while we are still waiting for a single night bus in Galway. This is despite the fact there is a proper campaign seeking night services in Galway. The aforementioned students, who rely on public transport to go out in the evening, would benefit from such a service. People who are no longer able to live within Galway city limits, because they cannot afford it and have moved outside the city bounds, would benefit from a night service, as well as the many people who work night shifts across the city and county.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I have seen two recently proposed housing estates in Galway city being denied planning permission because the location of the site is deemed to be too car-dependent. This raises the question why there are places in Galway city that do not have access to public transport in 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> A 90-minute fare can be bought in Dublin so that if a person needs to transfer, he or she is not required to pay a full fare twice. Many commuters in Galway need to get from one side of the city to the other for work. It is impossible do this by bus without getting a transfer, which leaves them paying two full fares per journey if they choose to commute by public transport. Compounding this issue is the fact that on the west side of the city, people are reliant on a privatised bus service. If residents wish to use public transport, they have no other option but to use the private service. This presents a problem if we want to bring in a 90-minute fare for Galway. As it stands, people in Knocknacarra would have to pay a higher fare to get a private bus to the city centre and then pay a full fare on a public bus to reach their destination on the east side of the city, and this is completely inadequate. The people of Galway deserve so much more in terms of bus services.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> While bus services are extremely important, especially for people within the city bounds and those coming from rural and isolated areas, they are not the only tool needed to improve public transport in Galway and across the west. We have to prioritise reopening the western rail corridor and provide rail links for communities along the west coast. We in Galway have been waiting for a feasibility study to be carried out. My great granddad worked on that rail corridor, so my extended family are acutely aware of the role is has had and could have. Opening the western rail service would no doubt enhance the travel options for people across the west, as well as allowing more people to live in the more rural and isolated areas, so that there is not an intense, continuous pressure on our cities such as Galway city.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> We have also seen that a decision on the ring road has once again been delayed. This has been going on for several years. At this stage, many people feel completely frustrated by the lack of progress. The most frustrating thing is that often all else is left in anticipation of a decision on this road. Without it being progressed, little else is happening. I ask the Minister of State to take on board my suggestions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_182">I welcome the motion and thank the Independent Group for tabling it. The vision set out would serve the people of Galway and the west well. I welcome, as always, the inclusion of the western rail corridor. It is rightly one of the key demands of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> This is yet another motion from the Opposition calling on the Government to begin construction. It is a turn-key project and all the planning is in place. With political will, we could commence the work in a matter of months. The western rail corridor has the potential to revitalise western communities, provide alternative transport options for people and deliver much-needed regional connectivity. The western rail corridor has become a byword for regional development and investment in the west. We have to maximise the potential of the Atlantic economic corridor with sustainable investment in the western rail corridor, Ireland West Airport, telecommunications, roads and education infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> I welcome the announcement this week that the northern and western regions are set to receive investment of €217 million, up to 2027, through the European Regional Development Fund. They recognise what needs to be done to support regional development funding because of the disadvantage in the area and the state the west of Ireland, and rural Ireland, is in. However, without the western rail corridor, what can be done in those regions will be limited. It is the elephant in the room. Everything will be constrained until we get the western rail corridor open. The publication last year of the economic report by Dr. John Bradley confirmed what Sinn Féin has been saying for years, that there is a strong business case for the western rail corridor and that it should be reopened and prioritised as a capital infrastructure project. It is a huge source of frustration given the repeated failures to progress the project. For Mayo regional development, it is no longer an optional extra, but an urgent necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The west and north west was downgraded to a lagging region by the European Commission after it became significantly poorer relative to the European average and this is why the extra funding is coming. We have to reopen the western rail corridor. The current unprecedented hikes in the cost of fuel reinforce the need for improved public transport services in the west, with rail connectively being a top priority. Investing in public transport is also needed from an environmental standpoint. We are telling people that they cannot cut turf, but we will not open the western rail corridor that would take so many cars and other vehicles off the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> The Environmental Protection Agency has already warned the urgent implementation of climate policies is needed for Ireland to meet its climate targets. It said that if additional measures are not taken before 2030, just 11% of the reduction in carbon emissions will be achieved by then. The sectoral emissions ceiling for transport, approved by the Government in July 2022, sets an emissions reduction of 50%, relative to 2018 levels, by 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The Green Party has been in government for two and a half years. What progress have we seen on public transport? We need to this to happen and everyone needs to get behind it. There is cross-party support for this project but the Government is needed. There are now three parties in Government and I know that the Minister recognises this. We cannot have a situation in which the DUP holds up the all-island rail review. It cannot be used as an excuse not to reopen the western rail corridor. The Minister also needs to make it clear that the line will be protected in Sligo and that the greenway will be financed separately. The two complement each other and one should not be given preference over the other.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">I welcome the fact that we are discussing this. It is vital sometimes that we deal with specific issues relating to geographical areas such as Galway. We know there has been much in the public domain about getting the public transport system in Galway where it needs to be. I am sure people realise I am not from Galway. I am very glad this is being discussed and dealt with but it fits into the wider conversation on public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I am not sure where to start. We welcome the reduction in fares. Everybody accepts and sees the benefits of ensuring we get more people on to buses. As has been said by a number of my colleagues, we need to deal with the school bus transport system. We cannot have the scenario we have every year in that, depending on the numbers who apply, we have a scramble around and all of us making representations to Ministers. In such a scenario there will be people carrying out walks to school and others following in their cars, just in case their kids are put off buses and all the rest of it, which has happened in Annagassan, County Louth. We need to make sure those pieces are dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Beyond that, we all know that planning issues need to be dealt with. The Minister spoke previously about almost natural selection with regard to the planning process. We need it streamlined in order that the particular capital projects that are needed get done. There are worries in my constituency in respect of the N53. We have the calamity that is An Bord Pleanála at present. There is a difficulty getting an oral hearing and there are worries with regard to finances and making sure necessary infrastructure is put in play. We need to look at how we do the entire design process between local authorities and all the other stakeholders. The Ardee bypass is another project that has never been brought to completion. However, some constituents have issues, which, again, is where we always fall down by not engaging sufficiently with the community beforehand.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I had a decent interaction with the Minister regarding the R173, which is the road out to the Cooley Peninsula, especially on safety measures that are needed at the Bush and Bellurgan schools. He agreed with it but the entire process is flawed. I could also talk about necessary works that need doing whether they are in Knockbridge or Shelagh or between St. Malachy's and the national schools there. We just need to improve the way we are dealing with the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> We need to engage with all the stakeholders with regard to buses, that is, the private coach operators. My constituents raise the issue of Bus Éireann and particular difficulties with the 100X. It is not necessarily making the timelines. People from Dundalk would use that bus to make flights at the airport. We have a considerable number of issues to deal with across the board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_193">It is great to have an opportunity to speak on the motion, although I do not profess to have any great insight into the Galway transport system. However, the proposer, Deputy Connelly, and, indeed, Deputy Farrell as Deputies for the area and the detail of the motion highlight the fundamental need for a bottom-up approach to a transport model that works for Galway. It is a wonderful city on our west coast that is choked by traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> I visit Galway city and the county a lot. I love the city and love visiting the county but visiting is difficult and it is clear that Galway is being strangled by the volume of traffic that has to through the city. We need a public transport-led approach, which is where the motion comes from. We have to be clear that, no more than ourselves, the Independent Group has one Private Members' business slot every seven or eight weeks. The business to be taken is a difficult choice and one into which an awful lot of thought goes. An extra decision has to go in to picking regionally-focused debates for Private Members' business. However, the important thing with regard to this is that unlike other areas of the country, the transport system in Galway makes national news on a regular basis and not for the reasons the people of Galway wish. </p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The most recent issue was that of the much-planned ring road, which is now in stasis and, previously, there was the Salthill cycle track. The two issues are separate and not to be conflated, but they are bound together by the fact that Galway needs a transport system that works and meets the needs of the people who live in the city and those who live around it. I have been in contact with our councillor in Galway, Niall McNelis, for as long as I have been a Deputy and spokesperson on transport, about the two issues I have mentioned and many others. Councillor McNelis tells me Galway is a medieval city and to access it, people have to cross bridges over the River Corrib, and the streets are narrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> The situation is difficult when the city is heavily reliant on cars and does not have a fit-for-purpose public transport system. Galway now has many commuter-belt towns. People in towns such as Spiddal, Knocknacarra, Barna and Carraroe are daily commuters into Galway from the west side of the city and there are others in towns on the east side. We do not have the facilities to cater for them and they are using cars to get into the city, which chokes it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Regular travellers to Galway from Dublin or anywhere else will make a decision, if they have to get to Connemara on the far side, about whether they will leave at 5.30 a.m. to beat the traffic. Travellers to Galway know they will get to the city quickly on our motorway system but once they get there, they have to decide whether to try to beat the morning traffic or wait until off-peak hours. That is an incredible decision to make. Anyone who travels to Galway, no matter what distance from the city, makes those decisions. This is why the motion is important and of national significance.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The western rail corridor is a potential game changer for the entire western seaboard and Galway, at the mid-point of the corridor, will play a vital function in ensuring its success. I have no doubt the western rail corridor would be a success were it to be fully reopened. It would also help unlock a north-western rail corridor that would run from from Sligo up through County Donegal, which has no rail service whatsoever, right into County Derry. These are the opportunities that could open up if we had a public-transport-led approach to the western seaboard. Galway would be a fulcrum in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> There are plenty of opportunities but in speaking to people in Galway and listening to the contributions from Deputy Connolly, there seems to be a sense of the unbelievable about anything happening. There have been an awful lot of promises, strategies, pilots and feasibility studies but all we are getting is more cars and not enough infrastructure to follow. I know of projects in my constituency, be it a big project such as MetroLink or a small one such as the coastal greenway, which people have been wanting and know have been needed for years but, ultimately, they feel that the projects will not happen because they have been let down so often.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> However, we cannot allow the city of Galway and, indeed, our western seaboard to continue to be let down. We need investment. This is a perfect example of an historic, growing city that needs an active travel- and public transport-led approach to solving the traffic congestion there. I hope the Government takes on the bona fides and calls within the motion. It is an excellent motion that we support.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_201">We are here less than a week after the end of the COP27 summit, which was held in the midst of a climate crisis that is growing worse by the minute. It was held to address the extinction-level threat to our planet. The summit will ultimately be marked by the absolute failure of ambition. There was no ramping up of climate mitigation measures, no progress on ending fossil fuel use and no agreement on greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. This failure of ambition cannot just be put down to being a consequence of the difficulty in finding common ground between all the world's nations. We can see the same failure of ambition domestically. Ireland's carbon emissions are still on the rise. The Government has not met a single sectoral target that it set to achieve the 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In 2021, transport greenhouse gas emissions rose by 6.1%. Galway is a case in point for this failure in ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> There is no doubt that solutions need to be put in place to combat the level of congestion in Galway city centre, but the proposal for a ring road is a solution from a different era. The planners of Galway city ring road acknowledge that it would do little to relieve congestion, with longer average journey times anticipated due to an increase in the number of private car journeys. They stated that there would be a significant negative impact on carbon emissions and the climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> A key requirement of the 2021 climate action plan is for the planning framework to reduce demand for travel by car, travel distances and journey times, none of which will be achieved by that ring road. This is not just a suggestion but a legal requirement for planning policy. The five cities demand management study aimed to identify avenues to reduce demand for private car travel in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. The study found that additional road infrastructure will not solve the issue of congestion in most cases and that, in medieval cities such as Galway, there is little space to do so anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The general pattern that has been observed over time is that additional road capacity leads to additional car-based travel, resulting in an increase in emissions, congested roads and even greater environmental damage. I am not anti-road, despite how often that label is thrown at people who are supportive of public transport. Roads are essential for bus-based transport or to build cycle networks.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> For a century, the transport strategies of the State have been about ripping up railway infrastructure and prioritising cars. Time has moved on and our transport strategies need to move on with it. The solutions are straightforward and involve reliable, affordable and accessible public transport networks. I underscore that networks must be reliable. Galway City Council launched an application to the European Commission to become a net zero pilot city. If successful, it would receive funding to implement innovative approaches to carbon reduction over a two-year pilot programme. There is a significant opportunity to transform Galway's transport system if some ambition and political willpower is shown by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Park and ride was core to the development plan in 2005. That has not happened. There is great support, ambition and desire for a light rail project. A feasibility study did costings for a Luas-style heavy tram system about ten years ago. Since then, there have been innovations in very light rail in other locations. A light rail system was designed and trialled in Coventry, which is innovative since it requires a shallow track. It does not interfere with utilities that are buried underground. This makes it much cheaper to build and install. Light rail has been much more effective than buses at convincing people to forgo their cars in favour of public transport. Part of the reason for that is that people feel they are less likely to get stuck in traffic on rail systems during peak times. We talk about rush hour but we now have rush hours because it has become much longer. Some of that relates to failures. We hear a new term, "ghost buses", used to refer to buses that do not show up. Reliability has become a real problem. It forces people back into their cars. That is happening all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> One can see the faith people place in the reliability of rail transport. People change their behaviour when it is provided. People will buy or rent houses along a rail line and often forgo the need to own a car. We can see that in other jurisdictions which have good public transport systems. Buses are necessary in that they are faster to roll out and can reach areas that rail will never be access. Rail has an unmatched psychological impact in making people switch over from daily car use.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Buses need to meet the needs of commuters, not the needs of organisations like the NTA, which tell people to take it or leave it. Where something does not work, organisations need to come back in to redesign it. I could not be more critical of the NTA's ability to resolve problems after it has designed something that simply does not work. I underscore that part, though not all, of the BusConnects system does not work and will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The all-island strategic rail review and the programme for Government both committed to considering reopening the western rail corridor. It would be an essential transport artery, connecting communities across the west and north west. The opening of phase 1, from Ennis to Athenry, was a proven success, with 531,000 passenger journeys recorded in 2019, in the last record that was produced. We had an opportunity for balanced regional development in the last 25 years. Let us not lose it in the next 25 years. In the last 25 years, Dublin city's share of the population fell from 13% to 11%. The share of the three other Dublin counties grew from 15% to 16%, while the share of the outer counties, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, grew from 9% to 12%, stretching out the commuter area. Between them, these counties account for 39% of the national population, which has grown much bigger. They accounted for 35% of a smaller population 25 years ago. We are going the wrong way with balanced regional development. Deliberate moves, including public transport, need to be taken if we are to encourage people to relocate and achieve balanced regional development.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I thank the Independent Group for tabling this motion. How we deal with the central issues of transport, climate change and future planning for our society is important for Galway and every region and city in the country. This morning, I listened to an interview with an economist about planning our economy. He was critical of the approach taken by the Government on all levels. One example he used was the lack of planning related to climate change. The obvious point was that it is inevitable. It will happen and will hit us in the form of serious flooding. We all know there are clear signs that sea levels and the levels of rivers, lakes and so on are rising. Rural Ireland will be severely hit without any planning to prevent or deal with the drainage and flooding issues, which need urgent planning. The economist said that when he talks to senior Government officials about these issues, their attitude is that they will look after it when it happens. They said they did not know Covid was going to happen and that they looked after it. They turn a blind eye to the need for forward planning. This motion creates a realisation of that need.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The importance of reopening the western rail corridor cannot be overstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Anyone who is into hiking or walking around the country, as I am, realises there are so many disused railway tracks around this country. They should never have been closed in the first place but as they have been, there should be a long-term attempt to reopen them and have positive effects on the greater region, especially in the west, to expand the vision of what our railway network could look like. I do not mean what it could look like in 100 years' time, because we do not have that much time, but what it could look like in the next five or ten years. We have to think big for climate and for our future and see the western rail corridor extending beyond Sligo to Letterkenny and on to Derry. For all the talk we have about a united Ireland, an attempt at providing the infrastructure on the ground that could join the two jurisdictions in a real way for people via frequent rail services accessing all parts of the nation would be a very concrete, pardon the pun, way of demonstrating what a united Ireland could look like for ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> If I lived in Galway and faced constant traffic jams, I can I imagine I might end up supporting the demand for a ring road, but we must learn lessons of roadbuilding both here and globally. I have just finished reading an excellent book entitled <i>Road to Nowhere</i> by a young man called Paris Marx. He is from Canada and summarises the experience in North America throughout the last century of dependence on the private car. We are aware of the huge impacts total dependence on cars for mobility have on climate and CO2 emissions but less well-documented are the effects on the communities and the lives of people . The endless demands for more and better roads do not provide a solution for the problems people face. Time and again we have been shown roads simply lead to more cars and thus more demands for wider and better roads. This applies as much to Galway as it does to the history of North America. Cities are littered with examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> A better use of the funds for the ring road would be the provision of a light rail system. It would be a much better and more attractive option to people. As has been proven around Dublin, it would be even more attractive than the bus services. Access to park-and-ride facilities is important within that. Although we focus on the standard rail service, a light rail service would have a far quicker and bigger impact on a city like Galway. We should enhance the bus services, but do so in a way that works and not in a way, as the previous Deputy said, that BusConnects has done in this city. A total bags has been made of the proposal to extend the service and it has been made worse for ordinary people trying to socialise, or get to work, college, or hospital appointments. Galway is an immensely congested town and needs a new deal. Like many towns it needs proper public transport and specifically it needs services that will link the population of the west of the city, such as Knocknacarra, Barna and Salthill, to the industrial hubs to the east around Parkmore and Ballybrit.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The blocking of the proposed cycle infrastructure was not a good idea and was very regrettable. The issues facing Galway are replicated in every town and city across the country, and the solutions are the same. We cannot lecture people about the importance of changing their personal habits when in most cases people do not have options for getting to work, college, hospital or out to socialise.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Our dependence on the car is not an accident. It has been carefully engineered by massive interests in car manufacturing and the fossil fuel industry. Car dependence has shaped our cities and urban environment, largely to the detriment of local environments and communities. It has hollowed out town centres and placed shopping centres in suburban areas that are built to accommodate more cars and indeed more people. We know the cost of reshaping our world for the private car in terms of climate change, air quality and the lives lost and injured as a result of accidents on the roads. We have no choice but to rethink those mistakes and look beyond the car as a solution to public transport issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The solution cannot be electric cars. They are a wholly unsustainable answer pushed by the Minister for Transport and this Government in a harebrained scheme to replace 1 million private cars with 1 million EVs. I am glad that plan has been dropped but we must reshape public transport in a radical and revolutionary way. Public transport must massively expand and we must adopt the idea of free public transport. This has already been done in over 100 cities and regions globally and there has been a major impact not just on the mobility of people through those regions and cars being taken off the road but also in improving quality of life, air quality etc. The impact on this country would be immense and make climate action seem more real and positive for many people. However, it cannot be on the basis of the sort of half thought-out unrealistic planning that has been carried through by the NTA. I am very critical of the authority. It has let us all down badly. It has gone ahead with plans, especially around Dublin and the BusConnects programme, in a way that has sometimes left people totally stranded but also wholly bewildered about what is happening with this State and our transport system. Let us not do that to Galway. Let us take the motion put forward by Deputy Connolly and her group as a template for how we should be dealing with the problems of traffic congestion, road use, climate, the environment and the mobility of people throughout our cities and towns. Such a template could be used elsewhere as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_218">I compliment Deputy Connolly and the Independent Group for bringing forward this important motion. Last week we sent a letter about the western rail corridor to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Transport to urge the Government to reactivate the reopening of phases 2 and 3 of the line from Athenry north through Tuam and on to Claremorris. For the Minister of State who is here, that letter was signed by over 110 Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas across all parties. Therefore, there is political support for the reopening of the western rail corridor. I am delighted the Government has not opposed the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> On the corridor being part of the motion, I was concerned when the Minister said a decision on the all-Ireland rail review has been delayed due to there not being an Assembly in place in the North. I ask the Minister and the Department of Transport to do something different. A draft has been prepared of the rail review. The western rail corridor is a particular section within the south of Ireland stretching from Claremorris down to Athenry. If a decision was made to clear that line and commission the rebuilding of the bridge at Ballyglunin we would be making a start at providing the infrastructure. Usually public infrastructure takes between five and ten years to develop but here we have a ready-made project. No planning permission is required. It is a replacement of the line just as we are doing between Limerick City and Foynes Port, where work has now started. I applaud the Department and the Minister for getting on with that work. This is another project he can do now. Further, the Minister should make it categorically clear the line north from Claremorris to Sligo is protected for rail until a decision is made on extending the railway up there. If a greenway is to be put in it should be put in complementary to, rather than instead of, a rail line.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I live in Tuam in north Galway. Many people commute from east and north Galway to work in the city. Back in 2008 Noel Dempsey opened a bus lane from Lough George into Claregalway and that was phase 1 of a bus lane to bring people into the city. We have private bus operators bending over backwards to bring people into work on buses and doing a great service against the tide. We are almost in 2023 and we still have not commenced phase 2 of that bus lane. We have buses competing with cars on the same lane. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking their cars rather than the buses because then they can use the rat runs all around the place to try to get into work more quickly. We are therefore doing an injustice to ourselves by not completing that bus lane. Incredibly, there is no land required. We have done about five feasibility studies and every other kind of economic analysis of it but we have not gone and done it. It is something the NTA, along with the local authorities, needs to get done as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Another bugbear I have is our planning system seems totally alienated from our transport needs. I have two examples. One is in Gort, where an application was put in for a residential project right beside Gort station.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Galway County Council was very excited about the project, yet when it came to planning permission it refused to give it. Back in the 1980s, Michael Kilgannon, a councillor, lay on the railway line to keep Woodlawn Station open. The station is still open but we had the ridiculous decision by the Planning Regulator and the Minister to direct that Galway County Council should not zone land in the area for residential development. That is an incredible decision at a time when we are trying to get people to use trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Yesterday evening a man who resides in north Galway rang me. His daughter goes from Craughwell down to Limerick for study. Every Sunday evening she gets on the train and she has to stand. There are at least 30 people in Craughwell trying to get onto a train that has three carriages. At this stage, her parents are contemplating bringing her down by car on a Sunday evening and collecting her on Friday evening because she works over the weekend at home. That would be easier than using the train. This is a line that RTÉ made a skit about a number of years ago because it reckoned nobody was using it. Today, it is the fastest growing line in phase 2 of the western rail corridor. We are now in a position where we are demanding more carriages to bring more people on it. If we are to change our transport mode from the car to other modes, we have to start with our youth. If we give them a good experience on the train or the bus, they will remain with it, but if we do not, their first objective when they get a job will be to save enough money to buy a car so they will have their independence. That is the mindset we have to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I was at the Galway county hurling final last Sunday and the traffic around the city was absolutely horrific. This was on a Sunday so there were no businesses open except the Christmas market in the square, the county final and whatever else was going on in terms of shopping. To get in and out of the city was a pure nightmare. I got from Tuam up to the outskirts of the city in about 20 minutes and it took me about an hour to get from there to Salthill. That is just not on for people visiting the city, whether on a Sunday or on any other day. There is a site at Carnmore of 135 acres. It is owned by Galway City Council and Galway County Council. I cannot for the life of me understand why they have not put a park and ride facility there and created a bus corridor into Parkmore to bring people to work rather than having them sitting in a big car park all along the roads leading into the city. I cannot believe the councils still have not done something about that. There seems to be some lack of understanding there, or maybe a lack of vision for what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The outer bypass will not happen in the next ten to 15 years, if ever. We will probably spend another €32 million doing reports. In the meantime, if we spent that money on making changes to our transport and facilitating buses and rail, we would actually do something to help the traffic situation other than creating more layers of paperwork. We are blue in the face talking about this. The bottom line is that if we do not act now, we will end up talking about this again in ten years with no changes. Galway city and county will be the loser there, as will the whole region. I thank the Minister for accepting the motion today but that is not enough. We need firm action immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">I welcome this Private Members' motion brought by my colleagues in the Independent Group. The M18 linking Limerick and Shannon Airport to the city of Galway has been an essential piece of infrastructure. However, not all is great. First, there are no services on that stretch of road. Not alone are there no services but there is no signage to direct people to services. It took eight years for junction 12 to get signage for services. My God, is it coming to that? Build it and they will come, yet we are not allowed to put up signage to direct people to services. A colleague of mine drove from Limerick to Mayo. They needed services but did not know where to come off because they did not know how to get back on the road again because of the directional signs. It is simple stuff but no one knows if it is there in the first place. People get to Tuam and there is no signage for services. Last week, we were told there were no services or signage from Limerick to Mayo. This is the responsibility of TII. Rural Ireland is again missing out. There is no signage to help smaller towns. I understand from my colleagues that people are shopping in Ennis, Athlone or Tuam - anywhere except driving into Galway due to the lack of infrastructure for the wonderful city of Galway. No infrastructure has been put in place to get people into Galway and there is no signage to direct people to the services that are in those areas to help people on their route.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I thank the Independent Group for giving us this opportunity. Earlier, the Minister boasted that he had spent so much money on footpaths and cycleways. That is fine where they are needed around towns and villages but what good is a cycleway, walkway or footpath in a place like Gneeveguilla or Shrone where it takes half an hour to go to work or wherever else in the morning and people have children with them and everything else? What benefit is that to those people? It is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> The Government's primary focus is on electric cars. We have to acknowledge that the batteries for these are made by child labour and slave labour in the Congo. Is the Government proud of that? There are other options, like biofuels that can be added to diesel that bring the emissions way down. The Government will not listen to those people. They have been in here to speak to us and the Government will not consider that option. Back in the mid-1970s, petrol cars could be converted to use the same gas used in cooking or whatever. There are very few emissions from that. The Government does not want to hear about it. People could use their same cars and they would be reducing emissions but it does not want to listen to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> A lot of people have to travel on the train from Killarney to Dublin. We have gone backwards with that service because before now people could get a cup of tea or coffee but there have been no canteen facilities on that train now for a number of years. It is backwards we have gone there. I ask the Minister of State to see what is wrong and at least give people making that journey of three and a half hours a cup of tea.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I thank the Independent Group for putting forward this very important motion on transport. It refers to the net zero emissions pilot project in Galway. The unfortunate situation I find myself in, in the constituency of Cork South-West, is that there is zero transport. Forget about zero emissions; it is zero transport. In many of the towns and villages where there is zero transport, it is nothing short of a crisis. From Dunmanway to Clonakilty via Ballygurteen, there is not any type of transport service, and these are populated areas. From Castletownbere down into Bantry, Kilcrohane, Durrus and Goleen, there is nothing. There is a bus that leaves Goleen at 7.30 a.m. and that is it until the night when it comes back again. It is "live, horse and you will get grass" as far as rural Ireland is concerned. This Government has been in place for two and a half years. It has delivered zero in relation to transport in west Cork. There are proposals but proposals are not a transport service on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I brought this issue up yesterday. I plead with the Minister of State to intercede in the matter of the Skibbereen test centre. Young people are trying to get driving tests because that is all they have. The only transport they can get is a car. It looks like the test centre could be cut down to one week a month. The RSA will not clarify that. The Minister will not clarify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Nobody seems to be able to clarify it. It has been said that it will stay open. What good is that if it is not operating properly? There were two full-time testers this time last year. One left in the past 12 months and the other is due to leave on 23 December. Where does that leave people who applied for tests two weeks ago and were told they would have a test within three months? They have now been told it will take six months for a test in Skibbereen. There is a serious issue there that needs to be resolved.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">I thank the Independent Group for bringing forward this motion. When it comes to transport and roads, despite what other Deputies have said in the county I am from, we need more roads, accessibility and bypasses. I want to wish the politicians from Galway well in what they are trying to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> In County Kerry, we need a bypass for the bypass in Killarney, to link to Farranfore and Tralee. We need a link road from Lissyviggeen to the Muckross Road. The Kenmare bypass needs to be completed. We need a relief road and second bridge for Killorglin. Work needs to be done at the junction at Portmagee, where a new road alignment is required. The Listowel bypass needs to be completed, something which is under way. The Macroom to Baile Bhuirne bypass is under way and needs to be completed. We want progress to be made on the Milltown relief road. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> There is a lot of work to be done in County Kerry, but we, as the politicians from Kerry, are advocating, pursuing and pushing for that. I hear other people saying that they do not want more roads or cars or to facilitate that. I have no problem with that because the money that will be left, and more, will be gladly taken by those of us in County Kerry. If people do not want the money in Dublin, we will gladly use every euro we can drag, pull and push below the Red Cow roundabout and spend it wisely. The people of Kerry will be very grateful for it. Every inch of tar that goes down will be well traversed day and night, and to hell with the begrudgers.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_236">On behalf of the Minister for Transport, I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate on a new vision for transport in Galway and other areas. In the motion and contributions from individual Deputies during the debate, we can see the range of challenges and opportunities that exist and the progress which has been made to date in reorientating our transport system towards sustainable transport. We are all in agreement about wanting to provide a comprehensive public transport network that serves the needs of all members of society in Galway and beyond. As the House is aware, the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options. Public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. Budget 2023 helps to support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> With regard to transport provision in areas other than Galway, the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan 2021-25 is a key component of the Government's ambitions in this area. It will significantly increase the number of bus routes and frequency of existing services across the country. Connecting Ireland proposes to expand the public transport network in rural areas and increase service levels. The NTA is planning for an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of the five-year Connecting Ireland rural plan. Hundreds of rural villages and areas will, for the first time, be served by a viable public transport link.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The NTA began rolling out improved rural bus services as part of Connecting Ireland in 2022 in areas such as Castlebar and Tullamore. Improved Local Link services will continue to be rolled out from 2022 to 2025 under Connecting Ireland. An allocation of €545 million will be made to public service obligation, PSO, routes and Local Link services in 2023. This will fund the delivery of enhanced rural transport services under the Connecting Ireland programme and new town services commencing with Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The Government also has ambitious plans for public transport infrastructure nationwide. The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. This is supported by the national development plan, NDP, which provides for €35 billion in Exchequer funds to maintain, enhance and improve transport infrastructure across the country over the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Under Project Ireland 2040, spatial planning and capital investment are being linked in a meaningful way, while significant levels of investment are being put towards new public and sustainable transport initiatives. The substantial investment in transport in recent years and the ramping up of major projects, such as BusConnects in all five cities, including Galway; Connecting Ireland in rural areas; the Cork area commuter rail programme; DART+; and MetroLink, means the national public transport landscape will continue to transform for the better in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The Government has made significant investment in recent years in 41 new intercity rail cars, which are expected to enter service in 2023. These new vehicles will enhance the capacity of the fleet and boost peak-time intercity capacity. The additional fleet may also allow for the redeployment of some existing fleet elsewhere on the network. In addition, the Minister for Transport is committed to nationwide rail service enhancements and provided funding of €6.5 million earlier this year under the infrastructure manager multiannual contract to upgrade the Nenagh rail line between Ballybrophy and Limerick. The replacement of old track on the line will substantially improve journey times and enhance safety of the line, allowing for the future operation of services at line speeds of up to 70 mph.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Regarding an independent study of light rail in Galway, I would like to reiterate that under Project Ireland 2040, spatial planning and capital investment are being linked to assist our climate targets through transport-orientated development. The proposal for a light rail transport system in Galway will be examined as part of the NTA's Galway metropolitan area transport strategy, which will facilitate an understanding of how the proposed system interacts with other public transport and land use in general. Studying light rail in isolation would remove these benefits and not provide an overall picture of the transport system needed to cater for medium- and long-term demand in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I would like to reiterate that the Government is fully committed to decarbonising the transport sector in line with our climate action plan and legally binding targets. The Minister for Transport will not reduce the level of ambition, including the Government's electric vehicle strategy. However, a perceived over-reliance on EVs to meet emissions reduction targets risks locking in further high levels of car dependency. In this context, a proposed reframing of the current 845,000 private EV target as an expected 30% share of the total car fleet by 2030 is not a reduction in the level of ambition, but rather seeks to better embed it in the wider sustainable mobility policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> To help us to achieve our climate targets, it was decided that from 2019 no new diesel buses would be purchased for urban PSO bus fleets. In 2021, Galway became the first city in Ireland to have a fully hybrid PSO bus fleet. As part of the Government's transformative Pathfinder programme, which aims to accelerate sustainable transport projects that can be replicated across the country, the Athlone town bus fleet will shortly be fully transitioned to a zero emissions fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Deputies will be aware that as part of BusConnects, the current fleet of buses will be converted to a low- and zero-emissions fleet, meeting rising demand and saving emissions in line with our climate action plan targets. Buses and shelters will be modernised, increasing accessibility and ensuring safe and enjoyable trips for passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Public transport investment, including in bus and rail, can play a major role in decreasing CO2 emissions from the transport sector and provide workers, families and communities with an alternative and more sustainable mode of transport. As the Minister for Transport outlined at the start of the debate, the strategic rail review will examine the role of rail in supporting relevant policy objectives on the island of Ireland. This type of wide-ranging analysis of our island-wide rail system is crucial to our consideration of specific projects, and in that regard the House will be pleased to know the review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network. That scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the western rail corridor. It will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop an improved rail network in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I want to assure the House that the Minister for Transport fully recognises and emphasises the very important role public transport plays in all our lives and is aware of the concerns raised regarding the enhancement of public transport for travellers in Galway and other areas. The ambitious investment plan for the public transport sector over the coming years, such as BusConnects in Galway and Connecting Ireland in other areas, will go a long way toward achieving these goals and will help to improve people's quality of life and grow the economy in urban and rural areas through the provision of improved transport links.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I believe that with the work that has been done in recent years, the ongoing plans and future developments, we will achieve a better public transport system for the people of Ireland. I thank all Members for their inputs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_249">I fully support this Private Members' motion. I pay tribute to Deputy Connolly, who drafted and presented it. Galway needs to be the test case for carrying out a model of transport that is different and where alternatives to the car are modelled and looked at. It is interesting that the OECD report, Redesigning Ireland’s Transport for Net Zero: Towards Systems that Work for the People and Planet, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_250">Ireland's national transport models project continued growth in car ownership based on income and demographic projections, and car occupancy is assumed to be constant in standard transport model runs. Alternative futures for car ownership and car occupancy are simply absent from standard transport modelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">This is saying that there is a refusal on behalf of planners and the Government even to consider alternative models that might give a better outcome. At the very least, we cannot really say that they will lead to better outcomes because we have not looked at them. We are faced with a complete lack of vision and a failure to see anything other than a totally car-dependent culture. The report states that with three out of four citizens opting to travel by car on a daily basis, current mobility patterns in Ireland are incompatible with the country’s greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is a fairly damning statement about our ambition to be successful. It states that growing car use in Ireland is largely determined by car-dependent transport. It suggests that decarbonising the system via private vehicle improvements is unlikely to lead to substantially different patterns of behaviour, rapid emissions improvements and large well-being improvements. What all that is saying is that currently we are about tweaking car use and not really making the substantive change that is required. One of the key messages in the report is that policy change is not and should not be restricted to urban areas. We need to have change for all of Ireland and that means the north west, and Donegal in particular, as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> During a recent Private Members' debate, we spoke about public transport requirements for rural areas. We should also be looking at the provision of rail for the north west and Donegal in order to move people away from ongoing car development. The West on Track and Into the West campaigns believe this can be done. The Into the West campaign looks at restoring the north-west rail corridor, which would bring a rail connection to Dungannon, Omagh, Strabane, Lifford and Letterkenny. This proposal makes sense because it could reduce travel times to Dublin and also reduce carbon emissions, which would be a win-win for all concerned. According to the West on Track campaign, a rail link for Ballyshannon, Donegal town and Ballybofey into Letterkenny could be provided as well. If this were done, a person heading to Dublin from Gweedore, Killybegs or Fanad could get a bus to Letterkenny or Donegal town and then a train to Dublin and be there just as quickly as they would if they were driving. It should not be unachievable. It can be done if we decide we want to do it. If the Department or the Government were using modelling systems that took it into account, maybe it would not be unaffordable, or shown to be unaffordable in order that it can be rubbished straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> The climate action plan says that in order to achieve our national climate objective, planning policy must work to reduce demand for travel by car, travel distances and journey times. It does not say that in order to achieve the climate action goals, we should not travel at all. We should travel smarter and, as I see it, that means by rail. Some 92% of members of the Citizens' Assembly that examined this issue recommended that the State should prioritise the expansion of public transport over new road infrastructure at a ratio of no less than 2:1 in order to facilitate broader availability and uptake of public transport options, with special attention to rural areas. This motion calls on the Government to "develop a transformative new vision for transport that will align with Ireland's transport emissions reduction targets, provide sustainable, accessible public transport and urgently reduce car dependency". How can this be achieved when, as the OECD said, "alternative futures for car ownership and car occupancy are simply absent from standard national transport modelling". To me, that says it all about our transport ambitions and, sadly, about the ambitions of our Government, apart maybe from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. What about the permanent government, which seems to make all the decisions about what is achievable? I believe that if we do not aim high, we can never achieve. By adopting and implementing this motion, this Government will be able to start thinking bigger, aiming higher and achieving more.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_254">I thank the staff in my office for their tremendous work on this motion, all my colleagues in the Dáil who have agreed with the substance of the motion, and indeed the Government as it has agreed with the substance of it. The kernel is in carrying out what the motion has asked the Government to do. I will hold the Government to account. There is a list of asks here with which the Minister has said he has no difficulty. I will look for a timescale for the implementation of those requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> In regard to the motion, I would like to give some reassurance to Deputies from rural areas, particularly Deputy Michael Collins who referred to zero transport. I totally agree with him on that. It is difficult for people to embrace zero emissions when there is what he describes as "zero transport" on the ground. </p>
          <p eId="para_256"> As I said at the beginning, this OECD report is just one of many reports. The significant difference is that it clearly tells us that without transformative action by this Government, we cannot reach our emissions targets. It tells us in clear terms that transformative actions are still marginal. I will quote precisely from the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_257">For a number of years Ireland has prioritized efforts and attention on policies that this analysis finds have a low potential to help the country transition away from car dependency and towards systems able to deliver sustainable accessibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">As of 2022, transformative policies are still marginal and are implemented only on a small scale or as pilot projects. Transformative policies are still marginal. I say that in the context of the recent conference that concluded in Egypt, in the context of Ireland declaring a biodiversity emergency in 2019 and a climate emergency, and in the context of the Budget Statement delivered by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, last year - not this year - when he said that the climate is burning. The climate is burning and we have no choice but to take transformative action, but our policies in regard to transformative action are absolutely on the margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> This is not a parochial motion. I am glad my colleagues have acknowledged that. It is about transformative action and focuses specifically on the OECD report. Indeed, the OECD did not choose Galway, which is significant, but chose Cork, Dublin, Sligo and Kildare. It also pointed out that transformative action was required not just in cities but in all rural and urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The Minister raised the question of what the two managers in Galway said when the decision was made to quash the order. Galway County Council, Galway City Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, three main bodies to which we look to do transformative change, said they were disappointed to learn from An Bord Pleanála that it would not be opposing on a "very limited ground" the judicial review proceedings taken by the Friends of the Environment challenging the board’s decision. I wish to pay tribute to the Friends of the Environment, which, along with its legal team of solicitors and barristers, succeeded in getting the order quashed. On what ground was it quashed? It was quashed because An Bord Pleanála failed to consider climate action and the urgency - the géarchéim - attached to it. The local authority management in Galway and the NTA, to which we now look to bring in transformative action, tell us it was a "very limited ground". The purpose of my motion is not to highlight the narrowness of the vision of the management, but to highlight the need for the Government to take a hands-on approach in leading out transformative action. We cannot blame motorists or people on the ground when the policies are embedded in the Government’s policy of car dependency.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> There are key recommendations in the OECD report. I did not hear the Minister or the Minister of State refer to our determination to implement those key recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> In regard to Galway city, there is no sense of urgency. We are talking about a feasibility study sometime in the future. The N6 project being quashed was a positive decision, in my opinion. We had a previous outer bypass that ended up in a cul-de-sac. There is no sense of urgency. We have no park and ride, and we are only now looking at that on the east side of the city. </p>
          <p eId="para_263">There has been no attempt to move the school traffic off the ground, no attempt to look at joined-up thinking with a plan for the common good in regard to all of the public land we have, from the docks, which is publicly owned, to the station and the airport site of 150 acres that was mentioned, and Sandy Road. All of those are progressing with projects that are not determined by an overall master plan for the common good that links the usage of that for public housing with an integrated public transport system.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I also extend a very warm fáilte to our friends and guests. They are most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> I recently met with 12-year-old Cara Darmody from Tipperary. I know the Taoiseach also met Cara in July. Cara is an amazing young person who campaigns tirelessly for better autism services for her brothers Neil and John and for so many other children failed by the system. Cara spoke to the Oireachtas committee two weeks ago. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_267">My brothers Neil and John have been treated disgracefully and I am here to stand up for them. I am also here to stand up for the almost 18,000 children who have been left to rot on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Cara’s family has been through a nightmare, fighting to get proper services for her brother, Neil, in particular, an experience her father, Mark, describes as “horrific, humiliating, and inhumane.” Neil is ten years old. In 2016, he was diagnosed as having a mild to moderate autism spectrum disorder. In 2020, with little progress or development, Neil was referred to a HSE child psychiatrist who was adamant that his disability was, in fact, severe. The psychiatrist’s recommendation was that Neil be re-assessed. Despite this recommendation being sent to three separate HSE managers, it was never actioned. Two years on, Neil has still not been re-assessed and has not received the services he needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Mark says he was told that Neil will be on a waiting list “indefinitely” but the local children’s disability team refused to put that in writing. No explanation has been given. Mark has made numerous complaints to the HSE but he has been stone-walled and the family is being ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The impact on Neil’s development has been catastrophic. He bites and punches himself all day. The child is non-verbal. He needs to be brought on long drives to calm down. He has to sleep with his parents every night. Mark, his dad, says the lack of intervention has done his son irreparable damage. By contrast, his brother John has shown real progress. John received earlier intervention after the Darmodys paid for him to be assessed privately.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The pressure on this family is immense. Both children need full-time care, which has resulted in the loss of employment for both parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Ní hamháin go bhfuil Cara Darmody ag seasamh suas dá deartháir, Neil. Tá sí ag seasamh an fhóid do na mílte páiste atá ar liostaí feithimh míchumais.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Neil’s story is shocking but it is not unique. In fact, I spoke to families in Waterford last night who are in a very similar situations. As Cara said, there are more than 18,000 children on waiting lists just for initial contact with a children’s disability team. Thousands more are going without the services they need. There are 2,500 children whose assessments are overdue. More than a quarter of children’s disability posts are vacant, equating to over 480,000 lost therapy hours. This is a result of a failure to plan and invest in the specialised workforce and in services for children with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Cara told the Oireachtas committee: “I am sick of adults who just talk. Why can you all not do something about this and stop the damage being done to children with disabilities?” What Neil urgently requires is a psychometric assessment, as recommended by his consultant psychiatrist. This is necessary to ensure that he is in the right school and that he gets the health and educational services he needs. When will Neil get his assessment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_44">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_275">First, I did meet with the Darmody family and with Cara some time ago. We had a good, frank and very useful discussion in terms of services for children with additional needs, in particular children with autism. I have been very clear on two fronts as there are two aspects to this, the education dimension and the health dimension. I am not satisfied and not happy with the services provided through the HSE in respect of children with autism. It is not at a scale and level that it should be at. It is not a funding issue as the resources have been allocated. The HSE is saying it is a recruitment issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> When I came into government, I would have had issues with the progressing disability programme, which has been advanced by the HSE now for over a decade but has really only come into additional resources in the last four to five years. I have met with many disability organisations, both service providers and users, to try to get to the bottom of this progressing disability initiative. My view, which I made very clear, is that progressing disability – the Deputy will know this from her own constituency - took therapists out of the special schools to have a general pool available, diluting the service. We made it very clear that we wanted the therapists back working in the special schools as a first step, and that has been agreed, although we are following through on the implementation of that with the HSE. There has been resistance. There are different perspectives on this but I am very clear that in special schools, the multidisciplinary approach is best. I want the therapists in the special schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> On the education front, over the last two years we have made rapid progress on education in terms of additional special schools, additional special classes and additional resources. We have more to do. We have also legislatively placed an obligation on every single school in the country to do its bit in respect of special needs, and schools have to be fully inclusive in terms of children with special needs and there can be no refusal of children with special needs regarding access to schools. That is also being worked through by the Minister for Education and there is very clear progress to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The availability of therapies is not satisfactory. I have spoken to different service providers. I want to be balanced here. In some areas, progressing disability seems to be working because there is a lower catchment or a lower number of children or young people being covered by a given area, and the workload seems to be manageable in respect of some CHO areas. In other areas, the load seems to be excessive. The key issue that the HSE raises is the capacity to recruit. I know that is of no consolation to children and families trying to access services.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> If we look across the HSE, it has had far greater success in recruiting therapists for a whole range of other services, such as enhanced community care. Indeed, I was at a stroke unit the other day and there was no issue in recruiting therapists for speech and language, physio and so on. In terms of children and the progressing disability area, there seems to be a particular difficulty in recruiting and, indeed, retaining therapists across the board. That is a key issue. I have convened two meetings so far with all of the Ministers responsible for special needs to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In the interim, we have to develop more accelerated means in terms of assessments of need, both on the clinical side and the services. In the case of Neil, the individual child here, it is a matter of services. The key issue is recruitment of a sufficient number of therapists to provide not just assessment, but interventions for children who require them on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">There is undoubtedly a big problem in recruitment and retention of those therapists and specialists, as the Taoiseach stated. Much of the difficulty is self-inflicted by the Government and the HSE. If they are not prepared to pay and reward people in terms of their take-home pay and their pension entitlements in line with statutory standards, they will have a problem recruiting and holding onto staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I asked the Taoiseach about Neil specifically. He has given me a general and global picture. I know how bad it is out there. My God, every family dealing with this knows how deep the nightmare and the quagmire are. I asked him about this ten-year-old child, however. Two years ago, a consultant psychiatrist said the child needs to be reassessed because he is not on the mild spectrum; he is, in fact, profound and severe. He bites himself all day. The household is chaotic. The child needs constant care and is not getting the services he needs but he has not even been reassessed and the HSE is stonewalling the family. That is a fact. I asked the Taoiseach when will Neil get his assessment. I would like an answer to that question, particularly since as the Taoiseach stated, he met the family directly last July.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">In fairness, I am not going to individually get involved in every case that comes before us in respect of services, such as the need for the HSE to provide services to Neil, for example. We will make representations and speak to the HSE in respect of the case but other children also require access to services and assessments. A recent legal case has impacted the model of assessment-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_294">I wish to again raise with the Taoiseach the housing crisis, which is a housing emergency, despite the Government's failure and refusal to declare it as such. In the lead-up to the important Raise the Roof rally on Saturday, which we in the Labour Party will support, along with many others in opposition, I wish to raise the real-world effects of this housing emergency in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> On Rathmines Road, in Dublin Bay South, tenants in 20 apartments across two houses are facing eviction. Many of them are paying in excess of €1,000 or €1,200 a month for a single-bedroom apartment. Some of them have lived there for more than ten years, while others have been there for 20 years. They are now facing eviction. Despite the Tyrrelstown agreement ruling, which apparently seeks to restrict mass evictions of this nature, the company that owns the property is using what can only be described as a legal loophole in section 35A of the Residential Tenancies Act to take these families' and individuals' homes away from them. Why? Because the company says the sale of the property would drop by 20% of its market value were the tenants kept in place and the landlord would endure undue hardship if that were the case. According to reports, the landlord in this case owns 70 apartments across the city and the most recent figures available show the company owned, in total, more than €20 million of investment property in 2019 - undue hardship indeed. Not too far away from Rathmines, more than 100 residents in Tathony House, Kilmainham, Dublin 8 have been served an eviction notice. Again, the landlord there has invoked section 35A. </p>
          <p eId="para_296"> We need to secure greater protection for renters in these situations. We need to ensure undue hardship for those who are renting - the families who are going to be put out of their homes as a result of these evictions - is what is prioritised in our laws, not the undue hardship provision for landlords. A home should not be a commodity.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Yesterday, the Taoiseach complained in the House that the Opposition is not providing constructive solutions and proposals to address the housing emergency. That is simply not the case for us in the Labour Party. In recent weeks, my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, suggested the imposition of an eviction ban, which is now Government policy. We also suggested revising the income thresholds for social housing eligibility. Again, that is now Government policy. We suggested a vacant homes tax. Although it has been watered down, it is welcome to see that it is now Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> This progress is welcome but I will offer two more constructive proposals. First, to protect vulnerable renters such as those in Rathmines and Kilmainham, will the Government take on the Labour Party’s Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 that we put before this House a year ago and which passed Second Stage without opposition from Government? It would give tenants better protections. Second, as I asked yesterday, will the Government use the term of the winter eviction ban to fund and strengthen the tenant<i> in situ</i> scheme? Will it use the opportunity to buy back housing and shrink the private rental sector to ensure greater protections for families and renters who are facing eviction?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_58">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_299">I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very important issue. In her opening remarks, she referred to a refusal to use the word "emergency". I pointed out yesterday to the House that when I was launching Housing for All in September 2021 my precise words were, "but the fact is that the social emergency that is our housing crisis cannot and will not be solved by any one department on its own". We will not get into semantics. Suffice to say that housing is the number one and single most urgent and important social issue facing the country. Access to housing is fundamental to our security, stability, health and progress as a nation. There is scarcely a family in the country untouched by the crisis. That is why Housing for All is a very broadly-based programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> In terms of rents, we need more supply. We need more supply and we need to build more houses more rapidly to give people greater access to different types of housing, whether that is social housing, affordable housing, cost rental or people purchasing on the private market. We have introduced a rent cap. Since December last year, the maximum by which landlords can increase rents annually in rent pressure zones, RPZs, which now cover a large part of the country, is 2%. We extended all RPZs to the end of 2024. A tenant who has been renting for at least six months now automatically gets security of tenure and can stay in his or her rented property indefinitely, so long as certain conditions apply. We also have the eviction Act, which has delayed and deferred any evictions until 31 March next year. There is a range of protections that have been passed by the House following legislation introduced by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> In respect of the specific issue raised by the Deputy, there is the Tyrrelstown amendment, which offers some protection. The Government has given local authorities the capacity and resources to purchase and it has communicated to local authorities to purchase tenancies <i>in situ</i> or houses where tenants are <i>in situ </i> in respect of HAP. These properties can be bought with the tenants staying <i>in situ.</i> Approximately 600 is my indication of the number that have been purchased or are in the process of being purchased to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> We need to look at the specific issue and the two cases that have been raised by the Deputy to see if anything further can be done to deal with what she is describing as a loophole. In the framing of the Tyrrelstown amendment, there has to be a balance to make sure we do not get it wrong from a constitutional perspective. That said, our objective and motivation is to protect tenants to the greatest degree possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">We can engage in semantic discussion about language, but what the 20% of the country who are now living in private rental accommodation want to see is action on this issue. We in the Labour Party have very much welcomed it when the Government has taken action, albeit belatedly, such as with the winter eviction ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">However, we do not think this action has been enough. We have called for a three-year freeze on rents, which is a crucial policy that should be brought in by the Government. Caps in rent pressure zones have simply not been sufficient to address the significant increases in rents we saw in yesterday's <i>daft.ie</i> report, notwithstanding that cap. We also want to see greater protection for tenants against mass evictions. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on that. How can we stand over a provision in section 35A that allows companies such as Hazelwood Walk Holdings Limited, the company at issue in Rathmines, to claim undue hardship? Why is the undue hardship of a property company more important than the undue hardship that tenants, renters and, in many cases, families, face, if they are trying to find new accommodation in the face of an eviction notice? What determines market value and how is it assessed in this scenario? How does the property company know that it will lose 20% of market value? As legislators, how can we stand over legislation that allows them to claim that and put 20 households out of a home, once the winter eviction ban has concluded?</p>

          <p eId="para_305">The legislation was well balanced in trying to give additional protections to tenants. In many instances, it has been effective in giving that protection. Much of the legislation we have passed has given protection. Some of the issues the Deputy identified in respect of the individual case are legally challengeable. We will examine that to see if any further actions can be taken to rebalance the legislation. If the legislation is being exploited in a way that is wrong, we will have to deal with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">Many thousands of people will come out on the streets for the Raise the Roof demonstration because of the failure of the Government to address the absolutely diabolical housing and homelessness crisis. I have brought to the Gallery some of the people for whom this is a life and death matter. Deputy Bacik may not have been aware that some of the residents of Tathony House she referred to are present. The 35 families in Tathony House have done nothing wrong but are facing eviction by a landlord who has had a massive rent roll of approximately €750,000 a year for all the years they have been his tenants. They now face eviction and the possibility of being put out on the street. They are scared and that is why they are here.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Residents from Rathmines Road are also in the Gallery. More than 20 families and individuals there are facing the prospect of eviction on grounds of sale. I have also brought in residents from St. Helen's Court, who have faced four years with the sword of eviction hanging over their necks from two different vulture funds that are trying to mass evict them. This is important in the context of the Tyrrelstown amendment and all the rest of it. Although the residents are still there, they now have an active eviction order against them. Even when they defeated the last three attempts by the landlord to circumvent the Tyrrelstown amendment, the fear, stress and anxiety led many of the tenants to leave. They could not put up with the stress on them and their families. The fear, stress and hardship that these people in the Gallery are suffering is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Jacqueline is also in the Gallery. She, her husband and her two teenage daughters are being evicted from the home in which they have lived for 55 years. Jacqueline was born in the house. They are a working family but they cannot get a mortgage because they are too old and the bank will not lend them money. They are over the income threshold so they are not entitled to social housing and they face the prospect of the street, unless the Government intervenes. Stella and her two daughters in Bray also face eviction, not only from where Stella lives but, since she is self-employed, from where she does her business. She will not only lose her home but her job. Their situation is best summed up by Jacqueline. She speaks for all of them when she wrote in a letter I will hand to the Taoiseach after this:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_309">My darling, beloved husband will be put into an early grave as he is a broken man. As the dad of the house and as a husband he cannot fix this, This whole situation is affecting both our health. We are a broken family living dark days in fear, Minister. I need you to fix this and I need you to fix this now.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The question from all these people is: will the Government use the €500 million allocated to housing that it has not spent to buy their houses and apartment blocks to prevent these families and individuals from being put into homelessness, and end the suffering, hardship and trauma they and their families are suffering, as are many others?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_62">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_311">As I said in reply to Deputy Bacik, the Government has brought in a range of legal measures to protect tenants insofar as we possibly can. Section 35A of the Residential Tenancies Act, known as the Tyrrelstown amendment, provides that where a landlord proposes to sell ten or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining<i> in situ</i>, other than in exceptional circumstances. That is what is stated in the legislation. It was a carefully drafted amendment to promote security of tenure in the interests of the common social good. It strikes a balance between the right of landlords to sell their properties and achieve a fair return on their investment and the right of tenants to security of tenure. As Deputy Bacik pointed out, there is an issue with how that is being adjudicated upon, or being progressed or prosecuted, whether it is by landlords or if the matter has been referred to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. I am not sure whether the cases the Deputy outlined have been referred to the RTB.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> As Deputy Boyd Barrett knows, we brought in the Residential Tenancies Act 2022, which provides for the deferment of termination of certain tenancies to the end of March. We will examine the issues he raised. We have a timeframe within which to do that but a balance has to be struck when stating that the answer to every single situation is the local authority buying out private housing for people who are way above the income eligibility thresholds. Those thresholds have been increased by approximately €5,000 in the interim across all local authorities. That may not cover the situations the Deputy identified but, again, a balance has to be struck there as well. We will examine the individual situations he raised. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has engaged on the issue of Tathony House, in particular, and has also worked with the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The priority in purchasing homes <i>in situ</i> has been in respect of the housing assistance programme, people who are on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and those renting houses under HAP or, indeed, the rental accommodation scheme. Approximately 600 properties have now been purchased where tenants remain <i>in situ</i>. The issue is that the Deputy is saying we should go higher than those eligibility thresholds. That has to be examined in a comprehensive way. It cannot just apply to every single specific case that arises no matter how difficult it is, and it is very difficult for the people concerned who were identified by the Deputy. That is why we will engage with the tenants and the council in the area to see what can be done in that respect. We will also make sure that we can support the tenants in the affirmation of their rights and entitlements under the Act. From what has been said, maybe the calls being made by the landlords in respect of this Act may not be the correct ones, legally.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">I ask the Taoiseach to look those people in the eyes. There has to be a solution. They have done nothing wrong. They paid their rent, they worked and they paid their taxes. The Taoiseach cannot say that there may not be an answer because of this legislative shortcoming or that legislative loophole. If people's incomes, for example, are under €53,000, even according to the Government's schemes, they are in need of some subsidy because that is what the cost-rental threshold is. Every single one of the people I mentioned are below that threshold. There is no reason, with the €500 million that the Government has not spent on housing and that is in its hands, that it could not buy those apartment complexes and houses to prevent people being driven into homelessness. We are spending €213 million on homeless services in the Dublin region alone. The Government can keep spending money on people in desperate emergency accommodation or it could buy those houses and those people would be paying rent to the State. The Government would then save them the suffering, hardship and trauma they are now feeling. I ask the Taoiseach to give them hope. The Government has the money, there is nothing to stop it doing this and it would make life better for people who are really suffering.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">The Minister said in this House that he engaged with the Deputy about Tathony House. He has engaged with the council on this. We will examine this to see what we can do to help the tenants. Our only interest is helping the tenants in terms of security of tenure. All our legislation has been about security of tenure and trying to provide extra protections. In fact, we have been criticised for that by people on the other side who say this has reduced the number of properties available to rent so restrictive are the measures we have introduced. In this instance, there is a threshold at some stage in terms of where the State gets involved and buys up everything. I am not saying this is what the Deputy is saying here. He referenced specific cases on which we will follow through and see what we can do to help the tenants.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">Coláiste Mhuire Co-Ed is the only co-educational and multidenominational school in Thurles. It has DEIS status and is the only provider of ASD classes to boys in Thurles. It is experiencing continual pressure to accommodate increasing enrolments since 2010. It has an enrolment of 500 post-primary students, which is an increase of 90% in the past six years. This enrolment does not include post-leaving certificate students. The school has reluctantly suppressed enrolments for the past three years. From 158 applications this coming academic year, the school has only been in a position to accept 120 students.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The Department of Education is incorrectly interpreting the demand for places based on the reduced enrolment by the school rather than the actual demand for places. Following a comprehensive analysis and despite the suppression of numbers, the school has confirmed a projected enrolment of 750 post-primary students.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> The current building is 40 years old and is not fit for purpose. The roof is leaking, the school is trying to manage 37 leaks, suspended ceilings are collapsing regularly due to roof leaks and the flooring throughout the building is confirmed as a serious health and safety hazard. The entire building is in poor condition with an outdated and inefficient heating and energy system.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The Department keeps putting forward stopgap temporary solutions. Tipperary Education and Training Board has had ongoing interactions and significant discussions with the planning authority in securing permission for temporary units on the school site. There is grave reluctance on the part of the planning authority to grant permission for additional temporary units to be installed on the site. The planning authority has told it verbally and in writing that it is strongly of the view that the Department should be prioritising the replacement of the existing temporary units rather than installing more of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> The cost-benefit analysis to rectify the countless design and structural issues clearly indicates that the most cost-effective option is to build a new school. Thankfully, all other schools in Thurles have benefited from significant infrastructural development over the past ten years. Coláiste Mhuire Co-Ed operates in a building constructed in 1981 that presents operational health and safety risks. It abjectly fails to comply with the normal standards of a modern post-primary campus. In a professional report commissioned by the board of management, many elements of the construction are described as having reached the end of their useful life. Any investment through the summer works scheme or an <i>ad hoc</i> investment is no longer a realistic or viable option. The accommodation needs of the school must be addressed with a new permanent structure.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_324">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The Deputy will recall that about a fortnight ago, he and Deputy Cahill accompanied me to the campus of Mary Immaculate Teacher Training College where we met the students and senior management. Clearly, the indications are that the authorities there would make a site on the campus available for such a new school. Deputies Lowry and Cahill advocated very strongly for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Deputy Lowry is aware that the project was approved for the school to provide additional accommodation comprising classrooms, accommodation for students with special educational needs and replacement of prefabs. This project had advanced to architectural planning stage. However, Tipperary Education and Training Board then asked the Department to reconsider the long-term needs of the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> A proposal for a new school building on a greenfield site, which is essentially on the Mary Immaculate Teacher Training College campus, was received by the Department in March 2022. This necessitated a further comprehensive set of reports. These reports were provided by the education and training board to the Department in late October, which is less than a month ago. The Department has been reviewing and considering all of this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I spoke with the Minister for Education about this following my meeting with Deputies Cahill and Lowry about the optimal approach here and what could be exciting and have potential for the future. A meeting has been fixed for early December by the Department to discuss the accommodation needs of the school with a view to making an early decision in respect of its immediate and long-term needs. The Department agrees with the education and training board that the capital investment previously approved for the school needs to be increased - so the Department and the education and training board are at one there - so that the accommodation needs can be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The Department has also collated data relating to the most recent projections of school place requirements and has monitored the impact of the continuing arrival of Ukrainian students and other new arrivals in order to have the most complete picture possible. The Department's priority is to address critical school placement requirements, including for students with special educational needs. The accommodation needs of the school are being considered in that context. It is intended that a decision regarding the accommodation needs of the school will be made as soon as possible following the December meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> More generally, the Department is also committed to an energy retrofit programme for all schools built prior to 2008 in the context of meeting climate action goals. That may not be applicable in this case but is of general interest. A pilot pathfinder programme in conjunction with the SEAI is underway with a view to identifying viable and scalable solutions to roll out nationally. That is the current position.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I thank the Taoiseach for what is generally a positive and constructive approach. I ask that the matter be dealt with as a matter of urgency. It has been dragging on for a number of years. Coláiste Mhuire Co-Ed is a very successful and progressive school and the management and staff there have been outstanding. They are delivering excellence in education under extremely difficult circumstances. The board of management is constantly refusing entry to children and parents are asking why. Under the current restrictions, parents are unable to access the school of their choice in the Thurles area and this must be rectified.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The Department must recognise that the school needs and deserves proper accommodation and facilities. I have gone through this with everybody involved. The only solution is a new school. Adding extensions and using <i>ad hoc</i> temporary solutions is a waste of public money. We need a new school either on the existing site or as proposed, on the Mary Immaculate College campus in Thurles. Could the Taoiseach ask the officials to give it priority?</p>

          <p eId="para_332">When I met Deputies Lowry and Cahill in Thurles, I was very taken by the presentation by the authorities of Mary Immaculate College and its vision of a synergy between second-level education, further education and third-level education all on the one campus. This has potential. I have spoken to the Minister for Education. I am conscious that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is sitting two or three seats up from me. To be fair, he has given a lot of green lights to education. The school accommodation programme has been over-expended. We have said let us keep building the schools if we can. I am sure the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform understands the potential this site now offers. I have been persuaded by Deputies Lowry and Cahill. Obviously, it has to be examined and put into the framework. A lot of money is going to be spent anyway on the existing project so it is just doing the right thing for the long term. The Minister and the officials are saying they will make a decision as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">Dr. Gabriel Scally will today outline the recommendations of the CervicalCheck report that have yet to be implemented in full. The lack of urgency and the foot-dragging of the Government in delivering legislation on open disclosure and ensuring the return of testing to Ireland, and the effect this has had on the women concerned, are unforgivable. The Taoiseach gave a commitment last week, following the death of Vicky Phelan, that open disclosure legislation would be amended to cover the incidents that led to the CervicalCheck scandal and then passed by the end of the year. A week has gone by and there has been no progress. In fact, the HSE is talking about meetings between the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and the Minister happening in the next couple of weeks. That is far too slow. We only have three sitting weeks left before we rise for Christmas. I ask the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure the necessary meetings happen this week, we have the amendment and we are in a position to put the open disclosure legislation on the Statute Book before we rise for Christmas, as the Taoiseach committed to doing last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">To be fair, I think there are a lot of positives in Dr. Scally's report and he does pay tribute to the Department and the Ministers in terms of progress that has been made. He does, however, also identify the absolute necessity for absolute candour in respect of the medical profession and the health services in terms of absolute disclosure to patients. In that respect, the meetings the Deputy referred to were held last week. The Minister has been clear. I am engaging with him on this issue, and with the Chief Whip and the Attorney General, and working with officials from the Department of Health, in respect of having the amendments for consideration on Report Stage by 7 December so we could get the legislation progressed that week.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">The publication of the Scally report today will be a marker for all to see what actions can and must now be taken by the Government. Last week, when we all paid tribute to the late Vicky Phelan, the enormous legacy she left and the huge work she did on behalf of women affected by cervical cancer, all of us looked for precise actions. I very much welcome the Taoiseach's outline of dates for amendments but we will need to see a very clear timeline from the Government on all the actions to be taken on foot of the Scally report, which, as we know, has just been published today. We owe that not only to Vicky Phelan but to all of those in the 221+ group and all those who fought so hard to see a better system of cervical checks put in place and strong and robust supports for those enduring cervical cancer and those who have gone through the system to date. We will need to see a clear timeline for all the actions to be taken on foot of this report.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Following the publication of the report, I understand there will be a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, but we have no issue regarding having a wider debate in the House, and statements should be organised in respect of the report. The key issue is that legislation is required, but also cultural change in respect of absolute disclosure and candour. Progress has been made but there has been, historically, resistance to enshrining this in legislation. I do not think it is in the political house, so to speak, but there is an opportunity now, for once and for all, to deal with this issue in this legislation. The amendments on Report Stage will be very clear in that respect. This is the desire of the Oireachtas, as articulated by the all-party committee as far back as 2015, I think. We must follow through on that for once and for all now for the reasons the Deputy has given.</p>

In the Gallery above us, we have Bobby, Reuben and Christy, along with their coach, Steven, from the Corinthians Boxing Club. This club represents the very best of the north inner-city. More than 40 children train there three nights a week, plying their craft and developing the discipline and responsibility they need. This boxing club is about to close because it cannot afford its electricity bills. Its equipment is not up to standard, but the club is not going to chase children around for subs during a cost-of-living crisis. I appeal to the Taoiseach to do everything in his power to keep this boxing club open because if it closes, the north inner city will feel the effects. This club really is on its knees and I appeal to the Taoiseach to keep it open.</p>

These ten years have created bitter fruits that have allowed fascists and the far right to exploit the refugee crisis. We have a housing crisis, not a refugee crisis, and this Government and previous Governments are responsible for it.

We had a meeting in Galway last Thursday night. It was organised by Cancer Care West and supported by the National Breast Cancer Research Institute. It highlighted the issues that are going on. We have four projects to be undertaken in Galway. These are the accident and emergency department, which incorporates the women and children's block; the replacement laboratory building; the cancer centre and a new ward block; and a decision must also be made on an elective hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We have an accident and emergency department which has been demolished to make way for a new one, but no planning permission has even been applied for. The go-ahead has not even been given to apply for planning permission. We are doing things in a haphazard way and creating a problem for the health service not only in the five counties of Connacht in the west, but also in Donegal.

          <p eId="para_360">As regards the idea that the Taoiseach of the day is being asked to tell a hospital to go and apply for planning permission, there is something wrong there. I do not know what the issue is. I take the Deputy's point, though. Speaking more broadly, we want to provide additional services and, in particular, to improve cancer services. The Deputy is aware, in the context of the radiation oncology programme, that a €56 million project is currently under construction at University Hospital Galway, UHG, and not before its time. That is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">On 22 November, parents of more than 180 children who attend the child and family centre in Bantry received a letter informing them of the decision to move the entire children's disability services out of the child and family centre and into a section of the Bantry adult day care centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">This decision was taken without any consultation with parents. The purpose-built child and family centre in Bantry opened in 2011. The entire cost of €1.3 million was funded by the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The parents strongly oppose this move on the basis that the purpose-built centre is a stand-alone building which affords dignity, respect and privacy for the children and their families. Over 180 children are being discommoded to facilitate the temporary relocation of a small number of adults when CoAction has had two vacant residential houses in Castletownbere for over a year now. The children are familiar with the centre and the move to the new building will be traumatic for them. I have communicated with CoAction about this negative move. We need the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, to work with our public representatives and the parents to get CoAction to reverse this decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">I have long been raising my concerns regarding staff retention and recruitment issues and the continuous scaling back of essential services in Letterkenny University Hospital. I raised this concern in February and this week we are seeing yet another resignation of a consultant in Letterkenny due, in his words, to "impossible working conditions". He is a consultant urologist who is known for his excellent quality of care. He has resigned from his post due to a lack of resources, reactive policies and impractical and onerous on-call demands. I cannot imagine any other urologist will take up this post if these are the conditions they are forced to work under.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> How long does this have to go on? How many resignations will it take before this Government intervenes? Is the intention to run down the hospital altogether? The people of Donegal are suffering at the hands of this Government's continuous inaction on these issues, yet the Minister visited the hospital last week when this resignation occurred. What exactly will the Government do to ensure Letterkenny University Hospital is adequately staffed and resourced?</p>

          <p eId="para_381">As the Deputy said, I visited the hospital and met the clinical and administrative leaders in the past few weeks and these issues were discussed. There is a new consultant contract coming into place. I believe that will help. We are also looking at whether there are additional supports that Letterkenny needs because of its location. It is so far from model 4 hospitals. It is something we are actively pursuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The funding is there. The posts are sanctioned but, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, the hospital has struggled to hire in permanent consultants across a range of specialties. It is something I have brought back to the HSE and the Department. We will continue to engage with the hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">I raise an important issue in relation to lending rules. As the Taoiseach will be aware, it is an exceptionally important issue given that thousands of people who are paying high rents are, unfortunately, unable to acquire a mortgage as a consequence of not being able to acquire a deposit. This is a major issue in high demand areas, such as Cork and Dublin, where first-time buyers are unable to attain some supports as a consequence of buying properties that are not new. They are locked out of supports. Will the Taoiseach engage again with the Central Bank to look at the deposit issue for long-term renters? This is a serious problem and a major concern to many young people in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_387"> In the first instance, in terms of the lending rules, there has been engagement over the past year and a half with the Central Bank in respect of this issue. It is an important issue because many people feel that people have been paying rent for a considerable length of time and have demonstrated an ability to pay on a regular basis amounts far higher than a mortgage would entail. The Central Bank recently took its decision in respect of macro-prudential rules. Notwithstanding all of that, I point out that this year we had the largest number of first-time buyers since 2008. That is largely due to the help-to-buy scheme and to the first home scheme, which will also provide for that. I take the Deputy's point. This is something on which we will continue to engage with the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health make the HPV vaccine available to women over the age of 25? We all welcomed the decision that women under the age of 25 could get it free of charge from May. Will the Taoiseach ask the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, to look at this? I am asking only for those women for whom it has been deemed necessary that they get the vaccine by their GPs or clinicians, that is, those who have been clinically approved to have it and for whom it is recommended. There are too many women, particularly women on medical cards but also women who do not have medical cards and are on low incomes, who cannot afford the €600 to be able to get that vaccine. Would the Taoiseach and the Minister be able to do that? It would be very good if the Taoiseach could do that before he leaves office. If the vaccine could be made available, at a minimum, under the drugs payment scheme, that would in some way ease things.</p>

As the Deputy will be aware, we are rolling out the Laura Brennan HPV catch-up programme. The NIAC advice I have at present is to provide the vaccine to those aged 25 years and younger but I am more than happy to go back to NIAC and ask for updated advice for those over 25 years of age.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">I raise with the Government, specifically the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the 70 days of protests we have seen - at this stage it is a revolution - on the streets of Iran. On 16 September, the morality police of the Islamic Republic killed 22-year-old Ms Mahsa Amini for deeming her not to be wearing an appropriate hijab while she visited Tehran from her native city in the Kurdistan region of Iran. So far, nearly 500 people have been killed, including more than 40 members of the media, and almost 17,000 people have been arrested. Is it true that Ireland is considering opening or will open an embassy in Tehran next year? This would be an appalling slap in the face to the ordinary citizens of Iran who are currently risking their lives on a daily basis against what is one of the most vile and barbaric regimes anywhere in the world. I urgently ask the Government to reconsider if that proposal is being thought about.</p>

These schemes provide vital infrastructure in communities not only in Kerry but throughout the country including maintaining graveyards, for example in Lixnaw, and working with GAA clubs in Crotta, Lixnaw and St. Senan's. Listowel municipal district has the highest disability rate in the county and the highest ageing population in the whole of the State. When there were crises such as Covid or the economic crash these community groups were there to provide essential services. The supervisors have had no pay increase in effect for 14 years. Their salaries have been eroded by tax increases and the cost of living. While the Government says it is not the employer the sponsors simply do not have the funds. I ask the Taoiseach to take steps because the only possible way to raise their pay is through increased Government funding. Will the Government do this to maintain these schemes?</p>

          <p eId="para_407">It is an issue. We are very aware that more and more dentists have pulled out of the scheme. We want to encourage them back. We have put in a considerable amount of additional money this year including higher fees. This money is in for next year also. The current approach is not working for too many people in the country. We need to hire and retain more dentists in the public and private systems. We have allocated significant funding for dental programmes for those aged from zero to seven years from next year. There is also money for catch-up programmes for children waiting for orthodontics. While these are important they are not enough. I have committed to the Department meeting the Irish Dental Association to speak about much more fundamental reform to make sure people who have medical cards get the access they quite rightly deserve and need. Far too often at the moment they do not have it.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">The Taoiseach knows I am someone who has engaged with the Minister and Department with responsibility for children on trying to secure accommodation in Waterford and the south east for Ukrainian refugees. My question relates to abuses occurring in our immigration system. Recently I wrote to the Minister for Justice regarding the status of people leaving other European jurisdictions on travel documents and arriving at Dublin Airport with no travel documents looking for refugee status. The Minister responded that in the first nine months of this year 3,705 people arrived at Dublin Airport undocumented and that of a total of 5,662 persons presenting who were refused leave 4,969 persons indicated an intention to claim asylum. The Minister stated it is clear that a significant number hold status in another member state and are likely to have travelled here on conventional travel documents. We need to do more to shore up our borders and immigration policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">There are issues which the Deputy has highlighted. We have already taken some action on people coming from some EU countries with documents that were dispensed with when they arrived here and then they applied for asylum. This is particularly with regard to European refugees. We disapplied some aspects of the European Convention in this regard because an abuse was identified and highlighted. We have to be vigilant that there is not this level of abuse of existing systems.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">I raise the ongoing investigation into the violent death more than five years ago of 21-year-old Joe Deacy from St. Alban's in Hertfordshire, England while visiting his relatives in Mayo. I met Joe many times in London when playing football. He was a fantastic fellow. He was Mayo GAA to the core. The Garda opened a murder inquiry into Joe's death after post mortem results showed he suffered a blunt trauma to his head. He was found lying on the ground outside a house in Swinford on 12 August 2017 by a passing cyclist and died the following day in Beaumont Hospital. After a brief sitting of Dublin District Coroner's Court last Thursday the family consented to an application by the Garda inspector from Mayo to adjourn the inquest for an additional six months so that new lines of inquiry can be followed and several witnesses outside this jurisdiction can be interviewed. No one has been held accountable five years on. I ask that the State supports the Garda investigation team to ensure those who carried out this murder are brought justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">It is a very sad and distressing case and our sympathies go to his family on the tragic loss of their son while visiting Ireland. It is a terrible and devastating loss to the family. We owe it to the Deacy family and in terms of their frustration at the perceived lack of progress we will provide every resource possible to An Garda Síochána. It is an operational matter for the Garda so we cannot intervene in this aspect. I hope the Garda will be successful in bringing the person or people culpable to justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">In the recent budget our colleague the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, secured a budget of €5 million for in-school counselling supports in primary schools. It is fantastic. I hope it will go some way towards beginning to deal with anxiety and the mental health issues that very much came to the fore in our country's young people during the Covid pandemic. A couple of weeks ago I visited Gaelscoil Mhíchíl Cíosóg in Ennis. It is a fabulous school run by Dónal Ó hAiniféin and Sinéad Ní Éigní the deputy principal. Enda Mac Gabhann is the post-holder in the school for mental health and well-being. This is probably unique in Ireland. The board of management is funding three hours therapeutic counselling services per week. This allows 37 students each week to go to a room where Aideen Flynn, a qualified psychotherapist and child play therapist, engages with them. This school should be used as a pilot school for this service. It is using very best practice. This is being funded by the school's own coffers. It believes it can achieve double what it is doing if it was funded. I ask that this be considered by the Government as a pilot school for this very positive measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very innovative approach by the Gaelscoil. The NEPS programme has been expanded and additional resources this year will increase the numbers by approximately 54 psychologists. This is my understanding. At a meeting of Fianna Fáil councillors at the weekend the issue of counselling in schools more generally was identified. Teachers have told me there is huge anxiety and well-being issues more generally after Covid in many of our schools and in society. I will speak to the Minister for Education on the specific issue. A pilot would invariably then mean a national scheme. We will have to identify and target.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The idea that schools would identify and prioritise therapeutic interventions is a good thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">I refer to the savage attack on two gardaí in Ballyfermot the other night. Over recent years, more than 400 gardaí, between trainee and qualified, have quit the force. Why is this? Why are there 300 fewer gardaí in the force now compared to two years ago? The Garda Representative Association president, Brendan O'Connor, was on LMFM yesterday. He spoke about a lack of resources, support from his peers, and a lack of support from the Minister for Justice. Why is this the case? In my county of Meath, we have one garda per 650 people, while other counties have one garda per 332. Why is the number in Meath double that of other counties? Why is this not being addressed?</p>

          <p eId="para_416">Urgent consideration must be given to a restructuring of the capitation grant for primary schools, with a greater payment per pupil where enrolment is low. There are the same basic costs in maintaining a classroom regardless of the number of pupils in the room. For decades, small schools have played a key role in providing education, particularly in rural areas, but in some instances in urban areas. I refer, for example, to Cavan No. 1 National School in Cavan town, which is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland. This issue is of great importance to schools under the patronage of smaller churches. Adequate supports must be provided for such schools to ensure they remain viable, are within a reasonably accessible distance, and are able to offer the same range of education services as other schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">Farmers are being vilified and castigated day after day in this Chamber and, indeed, by the media and other commentators in relation to emissions. They are being told they have to reduce emissions by 25%. However, many farmers believe they are carbon neutral and are sequestering more carbon than they are emitting. Why is no measurement taking place to determine what is going on? How do you know what you can spend if you do not know what is in your bank account?</p>

          <p eId="para_420">There are 14,318 Garda members across the country, an increase of almost 12% since 2015. We are committed to delivering 15,000 members, for which we have activated training and so on. We are very consistent in wanting to improve the numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I take Deputy Brendan Smith's point on the need for supports for small and minority religion schools, in particular. We will do our utmost in terms of the cost-of-living crisis and the significant increase in energy costs. All recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme will benefit from additional capitation funding in 2022. There has been an increase of circa 40% in current standard and enhanced capitation rates. The additional grant will be paid at the rate of €75 per pupil at primary level and €113 at post-primary level. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs. Arrangements are being made to issue the payments as soon as possible. Schools will be able to use this support to cover additional energy costs and other day-to-day operating costs that have increased. The Department is also ensuring that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These are available through existing frameworks and sourced by the Office of Government Procurement, and run until 2024. I will engage with the Deputy in terms of additional resources for smaller schools.</p>

Last week, I was in Devenish Farm in Dowth, which is carbon-neutral. The Deputy made a valid point in terms of a national-based survey of soils so that we have a basis from which we can assess the progress being made in becoming carbon-neutral. Many farms are not carbon-neutral at the moment. Very few farmers will say they are.</p>

            <p eId="para_443"> The Government has been working hard to implement the commitments in the programme for Government, supported through the co-ordinating mechanisms of the Cabinet committee process. The 11 Cabinet committees established by this Government reflect the broad range of policy areas it will work on during its lifetime, as set out in the programme for Government. Cabinet committees meet regularly to continue this work. Strategy statements, which have been prepared by all Departments, reflect the key national priorities as outlined in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> My Department has been helping to progress key programme for Government commitments, including the delivery of the Economic Recovery Plan 2021 and the publication of a progress report in June. The plan focused on driving a sustainable jobs-rich recovery, with significant milestones, and progress achieved in this regard, including in the transition towards a decarbonised and digital economy. Other commitments include establishing a unit in my Department to help to support social dialogue, and driving delivery of our commitments on a shared island, on a whole-of-Government basis, through the shared island unit in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> The Sláintecare action plan 2022 was published in June 2022. By the end of June, all 49 deliverables were on track, were progressing with minor challenges, or had been completed. We are developing a well-being framework for Ireland, for which a well-being portal and well-being information hub have been developed. A second report reflecting the outcomes of considerable consultation and ongoing research was published by the Government this year, and a framework and accompanying high-level analysis fed into the budget process this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> The national marine planning framework was published in June 2021 and the Maritime Area Planning Act was signed into law in December 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> The implementation of the Housing for All strategy is driving delivery of key housing-related commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> Engagement with European Union leaders to advance a range of high-level objectives in the programme for Government is ongoing, in particular relating to the energy crisis, Brexit, economic issues, external relations and Covid. In addition, we are pursuing a strong, collective response to Russia's war and illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_449"> There has been ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of Covid-19 on the provision of both Covid and non-Covid healthcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> We have been supporting the work of the United Nations through our membership of the UN Security Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> Oversight of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, which is the Government plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, has been ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework, which is a high-level framework to position Ireland as a digital leader at the heart of European and global digital developments, was published in February. It sets out a pathway to drive and enable the digital transition across the economy and society.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> We have been progressing work on the Government's response to the Future of Media Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> Two Citizens' Assemblies - those on gender equality and biodiversity loss - have completed their work. Work is continuing on the Citizens' Assembly on a directly elected mayor for Dublin. Two further assemblies, one dealing with the issue of drug use and the other on the future of education, are under consideration subject to Government decision and Oireachtas approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> A transitional team has been established in my Department to progress the administrative elements of the establishment of the electoral reform commission, which is anticipated later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 has been signed into law. The Climate Action Plan 2021, which includes the national retrofit plan, adoption of the carbon budget programme, and agreement of the sectoral emission ceilings, has been published. </p>
            <p eId="para_457">An update of the climate action plan will be published before the end of the year. Ensuring progress on implementation of the programme for Government will continue to be a priority across all Departments as well as through the work of the Cabinet committees.</p>

            <p eId="para_458">The decision to transfer disability services from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was taken by the Government at the beginning of its term. During questions with the Taoiseach last week my colleague, Deputy Clarke, raised the ongoing delay in transferring these functions to the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. Having expressed his concerns to the relevant Ministers, will the Taoiseach confirm when this transfer of functions will take place? The delay is the cause of significant damage to services. If the transfer is not expedited, this damage will take years to undo because neither Minister can confirm when the workforce strategy planning group will be established or which Department will take the lead on its work. The real-world outcome of the absence of a workforce strategy is the rapid and perhaps irreversible loss of staff to the disability sector. Will the Taoiseach follow up on this matter with the Ministers to clarify when the workforce strategy planning group will be established? The Department of Health has indicated that it will not publish the long-promised disability action plan as it will not be implementing it-----</p>

            <p eId="para_463">The programme for Government refers to the need for court reform. What action is being taken to prevent judges from engaging in sexual harassment of women who are before them? I have raised multiple times with the Taoiseach the case of Kerry judge, James O'Connor, who used his position to disgustingly prey upon vulnerable women who were before him on multiple occasions. I know at least one of those victims has been doing everything she possibly can to get justice, but the Judicial Council has told her that it cannot deal with the case because of when the incidents happened and because the judge is now retired. She has tried time and again to get the Garda to take this issue seriously, but seemingly with no luck. What is she to do? What actions are being taken by the Government to ensure this sort of thing cannot happen again?</p>

            <p eId="para_464">The programme for Government talks about energy poverty and fuel poverty. Is the Taoiseach aware that people who are reliant on district heating systems are paying exorbitant prices, well above the very high prices everyone else is currently paying? While district heating systems are sustainable, they are placing a considerable financial burden on residents. I will give just one example of the exorbitant costs: in one area in my constituency, the residents estimate the cost of taking a shower to be €12.</p>

People are seeing considerable increases in their charges and report they have tripled in the course of just one month. District heating systems are being charged commercial rates for gas rather than the residential rates other households pay, because the Government has not regulated this area. Will the Government, as a matter of urgency, introduce regulations to protect households that rely on district heating systems?</p>

            <p eId="para_467">A few minutes ago, the Taoiseach told Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan there would be a memo before the Cabinet next week on the issue of a new elective hospital for Cork. The <i>Irish Examiner</i> has reported this morning that the hospital will be sited in Glanmire. Will the Taoiseach confirm that or does he wish to comment on it? Does he expect the Cabinet not just to receive a memo next week, but to sign off on it next week? People are waiting and have been forced to wait for far too long on this issue. If the Cabinet signs off on it next week, will the Taoiseach give us dates for when construction will start, when the hospital will be expected to be open and in operation, and whether the necessary investment to provide good-quality public transport links will be put in place?</p>

I know the Taoiseach has met with the group of thalidomide survivors who are seeking recognition from the State and have a small number of demands. I know the group is very grateful that the Taoiseach met with it last Thursday and that a process is to be established. As colleagues will be aware, I have put down a cross-party motion in collaboration with the Irish Thalidomide Association. I hope a cross-party consensus can be achieved on the type of process to be established and on securing justice for thalidomide survivors. Will the Taoiseach comment on the nature of the process to be established and on how soon we can expect to see details of it?</p>

            <p eId="para_469">Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issue of the transfer of the disability section from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The transfer is ongoing but I hope we can bring it to a conclusion very quickly. It has not stopped the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, from being very proactive on disability issues more generally. I pay tribute to her in that regard. However, I accept the issue needs to be brought to a conclusion. I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of issues that have to be ironed out with regard to the transfer of a fairly significant level of services with attendant resources from one Department to another. It is not a simple black-and-white issue but my understanding is we will be in a position to bring it to a conclusion. As I said earlier, the focus has to be on the provision of therapies, for children and young people in particular, through the HSE. That level of integration with the HSE with regard to clinical need will still have to continue. The provision of services, notwithstanding the policy aspect, will be located in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The view, historically, given the enormity of health and all the areas with which it has to deal, was that the idea of separating out disability and giving it a stronger focus from a Government perspective would be beneficial in the longer term. That view came from disability service providers and the Oireachtas generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of judicial reform. New systems have been put in place for the disciplining of judges and maintaining of high standards. The systems are not retrospective with regard to judges who have retired. We cannot interfere with the operational decisions of An Garda Síochána at this level. It has to make its judgment in any given situation presented to it. I know the case the Deputy has raised. He legitimately raises the case, which is not satisfactory in any shape or form, but it seems from what the Deputy is saying that the Garda has taken its decision. We cannot interfere in that operationally. However, I hope the new structures that have been put in place will make sure there is a very clear pathway for people to seek to have complaints raised with the Judicial Council and for them to be adjudicated upon in a timely and effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> Deputy Cian O'Callaghan raised the issue of district heating systems. They did not fit neatly into the schemes that were developed, such as the scheme for energy credits. Some people may benefit, depending on their circumstances, from a range of payments we have made through the social protection system which have been quite substantial. I will speak to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications again on whether something can be done in respect of the costs being incurred by those using district heating and the degree to which they cannot benefit from the schemes we have introduced. I will follow through on that. I am not clear whether regulations can be easily signed with regard to existing legislation or whether it is appropriate to deal with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> Deputy Barry raised the advocacy of Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan with regard to the elective hospital in Cork. I think Deputy Barry would be the first to acknowledge the proactive work of Deputy O'Sullivan in advancing the cause of an elective hospital and its location in Glanmire. The Government will take a decision next week when the memo comes to the Cabinet. I have been a strong advocate for this. We have taken very strong measures to make sure this project is progressed because it has been hanging around for too long. </p>
            <p eId="para_473">There was an announcement of a second hospital five or six years ago but little happened. I am taking this by the scruff of the neck and saying that we want elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. Subsequently, we need one in Limerick too. It has to be subject to the public spending code, which has progressed by now. We will be in a position to sign off on this next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_474"> Deputy Bacik raised the thalidomide survivors. We had a constructive meeting last week. We agreed to set up a process with an independent chair to discuss a range of issues and to deal with healthcare needs, independent living and other issues. We should engage and allow that process to take its course so that we can get real outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_481">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> The Cabinet committee on Europe oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments on the European Union and related issues. It generally meets in advance of formal meetings of the European Council. It last met on 13 October, ahead of the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 20 and 21 October. As I previously reported to the House, that meeting considered a number of pressing issues facing the European Union, including Russia's illegal war on Ukraine and our collective response to it; wider impacts of the war, including on food security, price and supply challenges related to energy and how best to advance our collective response to them; economic challenges; and a number of international issues, including COP27 and the upcoming European Union-Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, summit.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> The next meeting of the European Council will take place in Brussels on 15 and 16 December. I expect the agenda for the December meeting will continue the work on the important issues we addressed in October. Those include developments in the war in Ukraine; energy, including proposals we asked the European Commission to develop at our meeting in October; and the economy. I expect that we will also address a number of international issues, including the European Union's relationship with countries in the Union's southern neighbourhood.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> An EU-ASEAN summit, bringing together European Union leaders with our counterparts from ten countries in south-east Asia, will take place on 14 December, ahead of the meeting of the European Council. This will mark the 45th anniversary of the partnership dialogue between the two regions and two of the world's most advanced regional integration initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> A meeting of the Euro Summit is also expected to take place following the meeting of the European Council. It will consider economic prospects for the period ahead. It is envisaged that the Cabinet committee on Europe will meet in advance of that meeting to consider issues on the agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_486">We have seen an escalation in Vladimir Putin's war on civilians in Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has spoken about cold as a weapon of mass destruction. We have seen the recent targeting of energy production and the madness of the attacks on Zaporizhzhia. We all see that this is happening because Russia cannot win in the field, so it is attempting to win in other ways now. This means there will be significant issues for Ukrainians due to the cold and lack of power. We also know we have an energy crisis across the board. That is another weapon that Vladimir Putin has. Both domestically and in the European Union, we have to get our act together to ensure we can mitigate issues as much as possible. This is also a matter of ensuring there is no economic contagion across the western world. This is a win that we do not need to give to Vladimir Putin. Beyond that, we have to deal with the refugee crisis with our European partners. We have to make sure that we have planning in place in this State so that we do not see a repeat of some difficulties that we had in the last while.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> While I am talking about the energy crisis, I will repeat what was said about the need for mitigations in the form of communal or district heating systems. I have looked at an amendment relating to the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, as a possible solution, but I am not particularly worried about what the solution is once there is a solution for people such as the residents of Carlinn Hall, who are paying huge costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">Has the Taoiseach had time to consider the judgment in the case about the EU–Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, brought by Deputy Costello? CETA has many implications for how we respond to the energy crisis, for example. I hope that a future Government in Ireland will decide to nationalise the Corrib gas field, which is currently entirely Canadian-owned. If we have signed up to the investor court system as part of CETA, at that moment, Canadians would be able to take the Irish State to a CETA tribunal, which is a private tribunal that is separate to the regular court system. If the Canadians won their case, in which they would presumably allege direct expropriation in contradiction of CETA, the Irish courts would be bound to enforce the tribunal's judgment. They would have no choice in the matter. There would be a situation where a democratically elected Irish Government would decide on a certain policy in response to the energy and climate crisis which would be overturned by a private tribunal which is only accessible to corporations. I will quote a couple of the judgments. Mr. Justice Charleton stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_489">CETA sets up a supra-legislative body through the Joint Committee with unlimited powers of interpretation of a vague set of principles within the treaty. The Joint Committee makes laws. These override the exclusive law-making powers of the Oireachtas. That process is in no way democratic.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">Ms Justice Dunne stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_491">Of particular significance is the “almost automatic” enforceability of CETA awards... To my mind, that is why it is necessary to have CETA ratified by the People, given that it cuts down the jurisdiction of the courts and involves the creation of a parallel jurisdiction whose awards are enforceable in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">Does the Taoiseach agree?</p>

            <p eId="para_493">Friday is the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. I want to express solidarity with all who suffer violence because of their gender or sexual orientation. In particular, I express solidarity with the women of Iran and all participating in the uprising against the regime that murdered Mahsa Amini. I also want to express solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community in Colorado after the nightclub killings last weekend. I salute all who are fighting back against gender-based violence. I wish the organisers of the protest on Friday, ROSA Socialist Feminist Movement, the best of luck and success with those protests.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> If society is to promote consent and combat misogyny, homophobia and transphobia, we need to take many steps, not least of which is the separation of church and State, including in the sphere of education. An improved sex education curriculum will only go so far when the church continues to run schools that are funded by the taxpayer. What actions does the Taoiseach intend to take on this front?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_177">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_495">Deputy Ó Murchú raised the shocking intensification of the war by Putin against the people of Ukraine. It is a brutal, savage attack on civilians and on a collective people. I was glad to hear this morning that Tony Connelly from RTÉ is in Kyiv to report live to us. It is important that broadcasting services can tell the world about the naked aggression of Russia and its efforts to freeze people out of their homes, villages, towns and cities. It is an extraordinary act of warfare to apply such terror to people, with a clear objective of trying to subjugate and suppress their desire to belong to the European Union, to a democracy and to their country.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">It is a shocking development on the Continent of Europe that such violence and wilful murder of people is taking place at the level it is. Deputy Ó Murchú is correct that Russia has weaponised energy, food and migration. That has created huge challenges for the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> I think the Deputy used the phrase, "needs to get its act together on the energy front", in respect of the EU but it has done quite well. There are 27 member states and each has different energy mixes and backgrounds in terms where their energy comes from. There is a range from the Iberian Peninsula to Hungary to Ireland. We get most of our gas from the UK and Norway. We get the bulk of our gas from the UK and that is stable from a security-of-supply perspective. Gas stocks have reached the targets the Commission set across the EU. That was a good day's work and has stabilised pricing. Europe is now looking at further mechanisms to avoid the speculator being enabled to create price hikes. I acknowledge we are stabilising prices at a very high level. I think it is 300-odd pence a therm compared with 55 or 60 pence a therm before the crisis. It was 600 pence a therm in August, so prices have come down since then. One of the problems is many of the companies forward hedged and we are still looking at a price of 300-odd pence a therm into March 2023. There will not, therefore, be an immediate reduction in price, but the stabilisation of pricing is important. There is much work going on at Commission level to try to decouple gas from the cost of electricity and to create new systems, which will help the EU situation. Our situation is a bit different insofar as we have the relationship with the UK in respect of the importation of gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> I take the Deputy's point and I replied earlier to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on mitigation for those on community heating schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> Ireland has responded to a remarkable degree on the refugee crisis. More than 60,000 Ukrainians have come to Ireland and the numbers coming in separately from international protection have more than doubled when compared with last year. These were numbers simply not envisaged towards the end of last year and before the war.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the judgments on CETA. I will examine those in detail. Quite a number of judges made their opinions known. I am sure the Deputy will agree CETA has been beneficial to many companies in Ireland and to many jobs. It has been in operation since 2017. Approximately 400 companies that are client companies of Enterprise Ireland are involved in exporting and are in the market in Canada. A lot of our produce is exported to Canada. It is a country we have good relationships with in the context of the rules-based international order. All that needs to be said because it rarely gets said by those who take an opposing view on CETA.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> The Deputy raised the issue of nationalisation of the Corrib field and what could happen. We must act in good faith with companies that invest in Ireland. The Deputy's approach would destroy foreign direct investment in Ireland, if a future Government just willfully nationalised someone who decided to invest in Ireland. Governments here do not have the wherewithal to speculate on fossil fuels, nor will we have it in the future. Where companies invest here they need to have that security that we have an international rules-based system, that there are no sudden shocks and that it is not the case you can invest in Ireland and then suddenly the Government takes a turn and says it is going to nationalise everything you have. That would lead to a banana republic very quickly. It would undermine foreign direct investment. Maybe that is something the Deputy wants because maybe he does not agree with multinationals coming into Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">The Deputy is entitled to that position but I need to point out the consequence of what he is suggesting would be quite damaging to jobs in Ireland. Many workers would lose their jobs because many people would not invest in such a climate or such an environment. I am making a fair point because it would create a degree of uncertainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_505">As I have said, the advice we have received so far is it can be resolved through legislation. Decisions have been taken at European court level on dilution of the investor courts and so on, but I will read the judgments. We will give this assessment and examine that.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> Deputy Barry raised the issue of the elimination of violence against women and I agree with his remarks in their entirety. I empathise with the LGBTI community in Colorado. What is happening in the US in respect of its gun laws is truly appalling. The degree to which people have access to high-powered weapons and the polarisation of opinion in America that allows such murderous terror attacks to happen is absolutely appalling.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> In respect of church and State here, we have developed a pluralistic system in education provision. Parental choice is important, so plebiscites are held in some communities about the type of school they want and parents vote. We provide for Educate Together schools, which are growing significantly, denominational schools, non-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna. That is what parents are looking for.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_515">I propose to take question Nos. 14 to 20, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> This has been an intensive period for British-Irish relations. I will briefly outline to the House the extent of my recent engagements. On Wednesday, 26 October I congratulated the new British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, on his appointment and we discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, including the Northern Ireland protocol. We then had a formal bilateral meeting on 10 November in advance of the British-Irish Council in Blackpool. This was a positive and constructive engagement, where in addition to Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland protocol, we discussed the war in Ukraine, climate change, energy costs and inflation affecting both jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> I welcomed the step back the UK Government had taken from calling fresh elections in Northern Ireland. I hope this will allow time to make progress on the EU-UK negotiations on the protocol. I also raised the Government's concerns regarding the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill. I highlighted the upcoming 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and flagged concerns regarding the stability and functioning of the institutions and the potential for increased polarisation of politics in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister and I continued our conversation over dinner that evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> I met British Secretary of State, Michael Gove, at the British-Irish Council, where we discussed a number of issues including the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the proposed electronic travel authorisation requirements, which are a matter of concern for us, and would undermine North-South co-operation in key areas such as transport, health and tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> The Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and I met to discuss joint initiatives at the British-Irish Council. On 10 November, I also undertook a trade, community and political programme in Manchester to show Government support for Irish business in the north of England. Earlier in the month, I travelled to Oxford to deliver the prestigious Romanes lecture. Finally, I travelled to Enniskillen for the Remembrance Day service on Sunday, 13 November. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland also attended and we had a brief meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">We have only two speakers so I will allow Deputies some latitude.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiOmurchu" eId="spk_184">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_521">I might not need quite this level of latitude. The Taoiseach has spoken a number of times to Prime Minister Sunak. It is fair to say we are somewhat more hopeful. Some of this is not on the basis of Mr. Sunak so much as the basis everyone believes that due to the conditions prevailing in the world today Britain needs a deal with the EU. I do not think there is anyone, especially in this Chamber, who does not want to see the protocol issue dealt with. We still have those fears at the back of our minds. We do not need the situation to disintegrate from a point of view of any possibility of a hard Border. I think all of us support anything that will streamline trade. Over the past number of years one could have made determinations on the basis of comments that have been made by British politicians and many such determinations would have been wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">I will not read too deeply into Britain not wanting a Swiss-style relationship with the European Union. We need it to move from better mood music into an actual deal on the protocol. Maroš Šefčovič and others are willing to do the heavy lifting as regards ensuring this can be as seamless as possible. We would all welcome that. In fairness, if that was the case, it would allow unionism off the hook it has found itself on. I imagine that in the Taoiseach's conversations with the Prime Minister, he will have said that everything has to be done from a point of view of getting the Executive back up and running. I welcome that the Taoiseach has dealt with some of the issues I intended to bring up. We are still dealing with the spectre of the protocol legislation, the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the amnesty=legacy or Bill of shame, as it has become known. I am not sure we will necessarily get what we want from the British Government. We have to maintain the pressure on it because there is an element of that government not really wanting to address the part it played and its dirty war in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> When the Taoiseach spoke to Nicola Sturgeon, did they have any conversations about the possibility of a Scottish referendum? We have all seen what has happened in the courts and the fact that this seems to be a gift that lies with the British Government. However, there is a feeling within the SNP that it would be very difficult for a British Government, no matter what it says, not to offer that referendum as a precedent has been set. Brexit is also a game changer in that respect.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_185">
            <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_524">I thank the Taoiseach for his response. There are few occasions when most, if not all, of the House is in agreement with policies that we have been pursuing for the past number of years, particularly on Brexit. Our bilateral relationship with the UK is of paramount importance to us. I appreciate that the Taoiseach's discussions with the new Prime Minister are probably at an initial stage, given his recent appointment. As my colleague mentioned, the issues relating to Brexit and the protocol are of paramount importance to this jurisdiction. The issues relating to the various legacy Bills that have been referred to, in particular the amnesty Bill, and our future relationship are also of critical importance. Some economic results were published earlier regarding the responses of countries post the Covid pandemic and to the war in Ukraine that show the UK is struggling when compared to the other nations within the EU and on the European Continent. In fact, I believe it is last.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> With regard to those bilateral discussions on the protocol, does the Taoiseach believe there has been any formal shift or realisation that in order for the British Government to properly deal with these issues it has to do so in co-operation and consultation with the EU and our Government and unilateral action will lead to the potential destabilisation of a portion of our island, which would be detrimental? Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity during his next discussion with the Prime Minister to raise issues relating to potential terrorism threats in Northern Ireland, particularly in light of the recent attack in the North? I also ask the Taoiseach to comment on the legacy Bill specifically, which is of grave concern to many.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_186">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_526">I thank both Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the mood music relating to a deal. The Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, was very clear that he wanted a negotiated settlement and outcome. There are issues the British Government feels need to be resolved. I was satisfied coming out of those meetings and we both agreed we would remain seized of the issue. We agreed that both of us would collectively seek to get this resolved within a reasonable timeframe. The key is that flesh is put on the bones of that commitment and that substantial negotiations take place between officials in the EU and the UK Government and that they have the political oversight and imprimatur to engage in negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> I also said it is important that the voice of industry and business in Northern Ireland is heard consistently on this matter. The manufacturing industry is doing very well in Northern Ireland and does not have a problem with the protocol. The food industry is very worried about the legislation the British Government has brought in because it involves a dual regulatory framework, which would be damaging to the integrity of the food chain. It is clear that the legislation was not industry-proofed or business-proofed. That is a point I have consistently made to Maroš Šefčovič and to the British Government. To be fair, both have taken that on board, as has the British ambassador here. Maroš Šefčovič has met with industry representatives in Northern Ireland and has heard about this at first-hand. There are issues around consumer goods and so on that have been legitimately raised and that we simply have to deal with. </p>
            <p eId="para_528"> I am very concerned about the Nationality and Borders Act. It makes no sense in the context of the North-South relationship and I raised that with Michael Gove. It will basically mean that an American tourist or anybody else coming into Ireland cannot go North without electronic travel authorisation requirements being fulfilled. The UK Government has indicated that it is going to engage with the Irish Government on that issue. Within Northern Ireland itself, that must be understood and highlighted because from a practical point of view, it is not implementable anyway. People coming into the country who may have an itinerary for the entire island do not want to break the law. Having that imposition on them could be damaging to Northern Ireland's economy in a practical sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> Both Deputies raised the legacy issue. We have said to the British Government that we do not agree with what it is proposing. There have been discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterpart and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in respect of that at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. It is not on that people should get off scot-free for terrible crimes. That applies to everybody, including paramilitaries, those involved in Provisional Sinn Féin and loyalist paramilitaries. If victims want to pursue an issue, they should be allowed do so. We have to put the needs of victims at the centre of the legacy issue. I have met many of the victims' organisations and they are very angry about this agreement. Legacy is not just for the British Government; it is for the Irish Government and for parties. I would argue that the Sinn Féin Party has a journey to travel as well in respect of the legacy issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> I recently read through Professor Liam Kennedy's work relating to young people in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s who were subject to punishment beatings. I also listened to an excerpt from a podcast with a young man who was severely traumatised and badly beaten as a punishment meted out to him by paramilitaries. We have to pursue legacy on all fronts. That young generation in the North seems to be the forgotten generation of young people who were traumatised by the Provisional IRA in the interests of maintaining social control or because there had been antisocial behaviour and so on. The treatments that were meted out, the kneecappings that went on and so on, are the kinds of things that need to be looked at from a legacy perspective. We have never heard from that young generation. They have never really been engaged with around the trauma that was visited upon them and have never been apologised to. There has never been an acceptance that this was a completely unacceptable way to do things. Such beatings destroyed young people physically and left mental scars, and they were stigmatised in their broader community. Professor Kennedy has done some very good work in that respect but that has never really been highlighted or profiled in any way. That speaks to the comprehensive nature of legacy and dealing with legacy. It cannot just be one-dimensional. It cannot be one-sided. For our part in the Irish Government, we have told groups that have come to us saying there was collusion involving Irish security forces or the Garda that we are open to handing files over. We did the Smithwick tribunal. I have said to the unionist community and the Orange Order to bring cases if they have specific data and an evidence base. It applies all around. There has been some degree of documentation on that generation now academically but it has never come out of the academic confines to be faced up to.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_531">I welcome the Minister to the debate. This budget and the actions she has taken as Minister show a caring, competent and concerned Government and Minister at work. This budget has been particularly well received, such as the €12 increase in the maximum rate of all core weekly payments, the €2 increase in payments for children, increases for social welfare recipients and so on. I also welcome the once-off double payment for all weekly paid social welfare recipients, including the double payment of child benefit, which I understand was paid last week, the additional €400 for fuel allowance recipients, the additional €200 for recipients of the living alone allowance and the additional €500 in the working family payment and payments for carers and people with disabilities. This money is going a long way to help people face the serious crisis we are all in arising from the energy crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> They are all very good and laudable measures. Work still needs to be done, although not by the Minister, on the energy credits. I have continued to bring to the attention of others the question of people who are permanent residents of mobile homes and do not have individual electricity supplies. Their difficulty is that they cannot benefit from the €600 payment because they do not have an electricity meter. It is a serious issue and I have asked the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to push a solution through. We have solved issues for many groups, including Travellers and others. People in this situation find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The cost of living is a major issue for everybody. We cannot expect social welfare to pick up the tab for the proposed increase in motor tolls, but people who use cars to get to work are very angry at this unacceptable increase. It is an increase in the cost of living for such people and will mean they will use roads that are not as efficient and pollute the environment. I understand the Tánaiste has spoken about this issue. We need to deal with it as a matter of urgency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReadaCronin" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_534">I am glad to speak on the Social Welfare Bill. Given that the cost of living is rocketing for many people, I will make my contribution all about the money. In my constituency, Kildare North, people are feeling the pinch.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The terms "social protection" and "social welfare" are important, good, positive, inclusive and caring. They form the basis of care for people in our society who need protection in the short term because of job loss or illness or in the longer term because of disability and caring. For those forced to depend on us, social welfare is certainly not something for nothing because when people have to depend on welfare they have little choice. People tell me they feel they have little power when in receipt of social welfare and are constantly being scrutinised. While scrutiny is necessary, it would be great if equal scrutiny could be given to the lavish costs in other parts of the public services and projects which overrun.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> In Sinn Féin we believe in society and want to protect it. Therefore, we want to reform the social welfare system so that it reflects the way people are living in the 21st century. We want to make sure that all social welfare rates are adequate and that those who have to rely on the welfare system are protected from poverty. We all know that being poor costs an absolute fortune. There is never any money to save for a rainy day or the chance to avail of a good deal in shops or discounts on bills. It is important that people forced to depend on welfare have adequate funds and dignity in their person.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> That is why the €12 increase in core social welfare rates provided for in the Bill is insufficient. It is insufficient even without the crucifying increase in the cost of living people are facing while everything is going up in price. These are the same people who have already cut back, not just to the bone but to the marrow. They are the same people who do not need the wealthy or privileged to lecture them in a patronising manner about how to manage their money better. You do not teach your granny how to suck eggs. Nobody knows better than those in receipt of social welfare how to budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> An increase of €12 is not enough to keep people fed, warm, in school or college and out of poverty. It will also not be paid until January, when life is already extremely tough and Christmas is on the way. It annoys people when they see everything else going up in the budget overnight, such as excise on petrol, cigarettes and drink, although that is not happening this year, while they have to wait until January for their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> In contrast to the Minister in this Bill, Sinn Féin proposed raising the working age payment by €17.50 and pensions by €15. Those in receipt of the living alone allowance would also get the €17.50 rate increase. This was carefully costed and based on the excellent and reliable work of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice. The payments we proposed would have been in people's pockets in October. The increases in the Bill are not sufficient to be social or protect people. As I said, "social welfare" and "social protection" are good, positive, inclusive and caring terms. Unfortunately, however, the Bill falls short.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_540">In her opening speech, the Minister stated the measures in the budget were designed to reach the people who need them most. I could not disagree more with this statement. Unfortunately, the budget was clearly not designed to target those most in need. This was very clearly proven in the decision to give everyone in the country, including Deputies, a €600 energy credit. This is far from a targeted approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The Minister was correct, however, when she said the Government compiled a budget that puts money in people's pockets - the pockets of big oil and energy companies, that is, because it is they rather than ordinary people who are being paid directly through the energy credit. It is important that we remember that.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The increases in the Social Welfare Bill 2022 do very little to protect the vulnerable in society during the cost-of-living crisis. We all know that once-off lump sum payments do very little to adequately address people's financial needs. The cost-of-living crisis is not going anywhere and once-off payments are not going to help anyone in the long term. The Department needs to stop putting an emphasis on lump-sum payments and meagre welfare increases year after year. We need to pay social welfare recipients sufficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Many welfare recipients in my constituency, Donegal, have told me they are struggling to put food on the table each week and pay their electricity bills each month. It is devastating and the Bill does not go far enough for these people. It is clear that the social welfare system as a whole is in desperate need of a major overhaul.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Many times throughout this year I have raised the issue of community employment, CE, workers in Donegal who are still waiting for <i>ex gratia </i>payments promised almost a year ago. I am very glad to note section 12 of the Bill provides for the payments at last.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I would be grateful if the Minister would let us know when she expects these payments to be made. Will they be paid before Christmas or will it be in the new year? The former community employment workers are waiting for these payments. I welcome section 17 which exempts the <i>ex gratia</i> payment for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors from income tax, given that they have been waiting on it for so long. </p>
          <p eId="para_546"> While they were mentioned in an earlier debate, I am very disappointed to see the Bill makes no mention of community welfare officers, CWOs, or the situation they are facing. I recently raised this issue in the Chamber. CWOs are under severe pressure, especially in my constituency of Donegal where they are stretched thinly.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> There has been a significant increase in exceptional needs applications due to the cost-of-living, energy crisis and housing crises we are experiencing. The workload of community welfare officers has doubled, if not trebled, and there has been no increase in resources or supports. In fact the Department has gone back to an online system and pulled back from the system where CWOs would meet members of the public to address their needs. Moneys have been spent doing up offices but CWOs are not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> It is incredibly disappointing that CWOs have been forgotten about in this legislation. I acknowledge that the Minister made some changes regarding the means test for fuel allowance, following the debate on last year’s Social Welfare Bill. I commend her on that and urge her to take on board the contributions to this debate and address the increased demands community welfare officers currently face as soon as possible. We need more CWOs. They need increased support and we need to ensure they are available and accessible to the general public. I cannot overstate the importance of this matter and the importance of the community welfare officer role in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I ask the Minister to scrap any ideas of creating a tiered social welfare system. I know she plans on bringing a proposal to Cabinet by Christmas detailing changes to the social welfare system. While I fully agree that many changes are needed to the system, the suggestion that higher earners could get larger social welfare payments if they lose their jobs is a very dangerous one. I urge the Minister to ensure that extensive consultation is allowed for any proposed changes to the social welfare system because it supports the most vulnerable in society. It cannot be allowed to turn into yet another system that favours top earners and values their contribution over the contribution of everyone else in society. Although this Bill goes some way towards temporarily assisting those in need, it does not take any real steps to adequately address people’s needs or keep people out of poverty. One in ten people is experiencing food poverty in this country. One in nine people in Donegal is experiencing food poverty. Will the Minister advise what this legislation will do about that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_550">Everybody welcomes the once-off payments. They are a help to people. I will concentrate on the core social protection payments. I will read the Age Action analysis because the work done by Age Action on this is second to none. It strongly urges the Minister to reconsider increasing the social welfare basic payments by €20 rather than €12. The Minister can do that. Age Action states that despite the united call across most civil society organisations for a €20 increase in core welfare rates, the Government got it wrong on welfare in budget 2023 even though it has the resources to protect those on the lowest incomes who have the least resilience in the face of the cost-of-living crisis. However, there is still time to fix the problem and raise core social protection incomes by at least €20 in the Social Welfare Bill 2022, rather than by €12 as announced on budget day. This would cost an additional €600 million at a time when tax revenue is buoyant from multiple sources, not just corporation tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> For older people the loss of spending power makes all the difference in terms of being able to afford to keep their homes warm, make essential car journeys or have a nutritious protein-rich diet. Older persons do not have the means to supplement their incomes. With private pensions and savings also losing value in terms of spending power, the State pension is the bedrock on which people rely to make ends meet. Most older people will not receive all the emergency lump sums and will not receive a higher pension until January. It is not uncommon for Finance Bills or Social Welfare Bills to contain measures that were not included in the Ministers’ speeches on budget day. The final decision rests with Dáil Éireann which must vote on the Social Welfare Bill that will set next year’s welfare rates. Age Action is calling for Deputies and Senators to support that proposed increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Based on information to date and the Government’s projected rate of inflation for 2022 and 2023, working age welfare payments will have lost €32.37 per week in spending power by the end of 2023. The State pension will have lost €42.54 per week despite the additional €12 from January onwards. The loss of spending power is so extreme because of the cumulative affect of inflation. A nominal €10 in December 2023 will allow a person to afford only what €7.76 would have bought in December 2020. By the end of 2023, a working age welfare payment of €220 will buy 15.9% less than €203 would have bought in December 2020. The €265.30 State pension income will buy 17.1% less than the sum of €248.30 bought in December 2020. Raising welfare by €20 in January 2023 will not erase most of this lost spending power but it is the least that must be done to limit the inevitable increase in poverty and deprivation next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> Age Action provides a table giving nominal rates of disability allowance and contributory State pension compared with spending power in 2023. It states that working age welfare payments in December 2023 will see a loss of spending power of €32.37. Over the year, that amounts to €1,688. For the contributory State pension, in December 2023 the weekly loss of spending power will be €42.54 and it will be €2,218 for the year. </p>
          <p eId="para_554"> Age Action notes that the data demonstrate that core welfare rates are falling further behind inflation which reduces recipients’ capacity to purchase essentials such as food, fuel and transport. The cumulative loss of annual spending power despite the recent increases of €5 in 2022 and €12 in 2023 means welfare is being cut in real terms. Once-off energy emergency payments will further reduce the gap but many of these payments will not reach all households on welfare and will not compensate for the long-term effect of losing weekly spending power. For example, a person on a working age payment of €220 would need €1,688 in lump-sum payments by the end of 2023 to compensate for his or her lost spending power despite the €12 increase in weekly income. A person on the contributory State pension would need €2,218. Most households do not receive the full range of emergency lump payments and in every case the amount received falls short of the loss of spending power.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> In his budget speech, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, claimed that an older person living alone on fuel allowance would gain €2,375 between budget day and the end of 2023. This does not apply to many older persons, according to Age Action. Its report states that about 61% of older persons will fully benefit from the €600 electricity credits. The rest will share the benefit with others in their household or will not receive it. Approximately 31% of older persons of more than 66 years of age will receive the €200 living alone lump sum. Older persons living with siblings or other adults obviously do not receive it. A maximum of 40% of older persons receive fuel allowance and will benefit from the €400 fuel allowance lump sum. The expanded eligibility criteria will not apply until January 2023. New recipients will not receive that lump sum, or perhaps they will. I ask the Minister to clarify whether new recipients will receive that lump sum on a <i>pro rata </i>basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Only two thirds of State pension recipients get the full rate. This means that one third will receive less than the extra €12 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Regarding the €253.30 bonus State pension, 100% of State pension recipients would obviously benefit from the extra week's payment in October, which would be paid at the existing rate. Only two thirds will get the full amount. However, some 58,000 people will turn 66 after October and into next year and they will not gain the full sum.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Age Action goes on to make a few other points. In particular, it states that tax revenues for September 2022 were €12 billion higher than in September 2021, an increase of 26%, with corporation tax accounting for less than half of the extra revenue available, VAT accounting for €2.8 billion and income tax accounting for €2.9 billion. In addition, up to the end of June 2022, the Social Insurance Fund was running a current account surplus of €721 million compared to a deficit of €1.1 billion at the same time in 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The Central Bank has noted that welfare increases are a targeted measure whereas other decisions such as electricity credits for all households are among €2 billion of budget 2023 measures that were not targeted. In August 2022, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, advised the State that European countries should protect the poorest households from energy price rises and that putting in place relief measures to support low-income households, who have the least means to cope with a spike in energy prices, is, therefore, a priority. It stated that policymakers should shift decisively away from broad-based measures to targeted relief policies, including income support for the most vulnerable. For example, fully offsetting the increased cost of living for the bottom 20% of households would cost the Government 0.4% of GDP on average for the whole of 2022, and it would cost 0.9% of GDP to fully compensate the bottom 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Age Action makes the point that despite recommendations from the Pensions Commission report to benchmark and index link welfare payments, the Government continues to ignore the social justice and business benefits of welfare indexation, which will stabilise the incomes of those who rely on the State for low and fixed incomes. That is from Age Action, a worthy organisation which has done a lot of research. I ask the Minister to consider the points it is making. I will put down an amendment to the Bill to ask for a report on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> My last point is about community welfare officers, an issue I have been raising with the Minister for a long time. I suggest they are put back in the community either full-time or part-time. It was back in the 1970s that Brendan Corish introduced the community welfare officers and they were called that because they were actually embedded in the community. The idea was that people could go for emergency payments for electricity and so on. Given the fact it is taking up to six weeks for some of those emergency payments to come through, it is very important that we bring these officers back into the community for even two or three days a week so people have access to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_565">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which gives effect to the measures announced on budget day back in September. What a good budget that was. It had €4 billion of measures to address the cost-of-living pressures people are facing, and €900 million was allocated to permanent increases in social welfare payments. There were a lot of really good things. I know the double payment of children's allowance has helped many people in recent weeks. There were huge increases in the social welfare budget this time around. We saw more people qualifying for the working family payment and the qualified child allowance and the fuel allowance were also increased, as were payments for carers and people on community employment schemes. There are an awful lot of positives.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I ask that some fluidity be built into this. Normally, hardships were felt by the people of this country in the winter months but it is about the economic outlook globally, not just the Irish economic outlook, as Sinn Féin might try to tell us, day in, day out, on the airwaves. The global economic outlook is rather shaky from February of next year onwards. We are in a state of stagnation at the moment but the global outlook changes in the early spring period. With that, there has to be an in-built fluidity to all of this, just like there was throughout the Covid pandemic, so social welfare can be reactionary to the state of the nation at the time and the hardships that people are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> That is why we have gone into government - to look after the people who are struggling most in this country. Sinn Féin Members can laugh all they want but they want to decrease the pension age.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">They would want to look at how they are governing in the North because everything they have done in the North has been about suppressing people and keeping a lowest common denominator that feeds a voting base. That is wrong; it is immoral.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Springboard has been a revelation and it is a fantastic pathway back into employment, but there are still too many people locked out of it, including people on invalidity pensions. Several people have come to my office whose circumstances have changed somewhat and they now want to take on these courses and see if there is a pathway for them to re-emerge and to return to the work environment, but so far they are meeting obstacle after obstacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> The community welfare officer system, referenced by Deputy Joan Collins, was a fantastic model of in-the-community supports for people. I live in south-east Clare, where at the Westbury health centre every Thursday afternoon there was a queue of people who would wait to meet the community welfare officer. It was the perfect one-stop shop for all sorts of supports. Since that was has been withdrawn, many of them come to our offices but many do not come to our offices. There are people who could avail of more of the supports provided for in this budget but they do not quite know where to go for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> This Bill is really good, although it has been criticised. Deputy Gould can scoff as much as he wants because that is what he has done every week. Every week since he has been elected, he has sat there scoffing at measures that are making a real difference in Ireland. He should look at his counterparts in the North.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I note this Bill is not going to the select committee. I do not know whose decision that was and I presume it was the Business Committee, but would we dream of doing that to the Finance Bill? Is it because one deals with the big people and the other with the small people? This is the Bill that every year deals with the small people on the ground, for better or worse. I will certainly be lobbying within my own party next year for the Social Welfare Bill to go to the select committee for detailed analysis. At a select committee, as with all committees, very little changes on the day but it can often lead to changes in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Second, I note that the social welfare increases are below the rate of inflation, and there is no denying that. There are many one-off payments and I know why that is so. It is because there is a limit to the amount of money available and there is a consideration that some of the money that is coming into the Exchequer at the moment might be transient. On the other hand, we cannot have welfare recipients going backwards in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> There are good things in this Bill. I particularly welcome the changes in the fuel allowance. As the Minister knows, the committee has been arguing for a long time on that issue. At the same time, we need structural changes in welfare. There was talk about bringing in a universal working age payment, rather than having all of these different payments. I do not know if that has been dropped. I often wonder why, if someone cannot work, to get effectively the same payment they have to go through all sorts of different hoops and onto different schemes. I would like to see us eventually looking seriously at the basic income. Individualisation is not going to go away. As family make-up becomes more complex, it is something that, sooner or later, we will have to look at. As the Minister knows, I have been arguing for a long time about changes to the means test, and I welcome the announcement the Minister made at the select committee this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Of all of the one-off payments, one that I would like to keep as a one-off payment but paid every year is the double child benefit. I think it would be of great assistance to parents if that was paid in September or August every year because there are enormous costs on all families at back-to-school time in paying for clubs, music lessons and all of these costs up-front. That should be seriously considered by the Government. I will go into more detail on technical issues on another day.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I am glad that is all cleared up now. The Ceann Comhairle is welcome back. I am delighted to see him.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I strongly support the remarks of Deputy Joan Collins in respect of community welfare officers. The net effect of the administrative changes that have been made in that regard has been to make the poor poorer. That is my day-to-day experience of how those changes have worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I am sure there is a good reason for it, but I and many other Deputies have been confined to three minutes speaking time on the biggest item of annual Government expenditure. I do not know whose idea it was but it is not a very good one. I would love to have it explained to me. I will have to confine myself to asking the Minister a few questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> In the context of the Government's compensation package for people affected by inflation, there was an announcement that a lump sum of €500 will be paid to most categories of social welfare recipients, such as those in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension and so on. As the Minister will be aware, people on such allowances are entitled to take short-term training courses under the aegis of SOLAS, during which time they continue to get their social welfare allowance. They do not get an increased amount; they continue to get their usual amount. I found out, to my absolute bemusement - this was confirmed in a written reply sent to me by the Minister - that if the date of payment of that €500 coincides with a time when a person is on such a training course, he or she does not get the €500. That is daft, frankly. It is insupportable. It is a deterrent to people going on training courses that are designed to help them back into the workplace. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on 15 November and he agreed it is a glaring anomaly and stated it would be resolved. Is it going to be resolved? If so, when and how? </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The Minister recently made an announcement encouraging people to stay on working after they reach the age of 66. What is the position with regard to all the people who are contractually bound to retire at 65? The Government has consistently refused to legislate or accept legislation to outlaw that type of contract. We are told that to interfere with them now would be unconstitutional. If it is unconstitutional, let us have a referendum and change the Constitution. We have had referendums previously on less serious matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> What is the current status of the auto-enrolment scheme? Is the Department going to press ahead with the scheme as announced? Is it working on that? Will there be a proper debate on the matter in the House? The scheme as announced contains a number of serious flaws and could be much improved. It should be properly debated in the House. When will it be in operation? It has been delayed for two years, largely due to Covid. According to my calculations, a person on €45,000 a year will have lost approximately €8,000 in benefits from his or her employer and the State as a result of that delay. </p>
          <p eId="para_591"> If the Minister could specifically answer those questions when replying, I would much appreciate it.</p>

In fact, the time available for Second Stage debates is also decided by the Government Chief Whip and the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">It is good to have the Ceann Comhairle back. I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I, too, wish to refer to community welfare officers and the work they did in the past. When a person applies for supplementary welfare now, he or she has to wait a considerable time before getting approval. It is normally the case that when a person applies for supplementary welfare allowance, it is a matter of great urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> An issue linked to that relates to volunteers at the Citizens Information Services. In Kilkenny, there are two and a half members of staff. The centre had nearly 60 volunteers but, for some reason, it now has to limit the number of volunteers. What does that have to do with the Bill? A considerable number of constituents who may not turn up at the office of a Deputy will turn up at a Citizens Information Service and be helped by professionally trained people to complete their applications. The Citizens Information Service in Kilkenny now has to close at certain times and stop the one-to-one interaction with the individuals who turn up. I find that disturbing because many people like to turn up privately to discuss their business and get an issue resolved. Someone in the Government needs to look at allowing the volunteers to do their work and be accommodated in terms of the services the Citizen Information Service delivers. Two and a half staff members cannot deliver the range of services that was previously delivered by the permanent staff and nearly 60 volunteers. It is an urgent matter that should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I welcome the changes that will be made to the fuel allowance in January 2023, but I wish to ask the Minister, as I did in a parliamentary question recently, about retired public servants who, at pension age, cannot qualify for the fuel allowance. If they have a change of family circumstances, however, and a partner dies, the person can then, because he or she is drawing a welfare payment, qualify for the fuel allowance. That is an anomaly in the system that needs to be addressed urgently. Changes are coming in January 2023 but they should happen sooner because people are suffering fuel poverty and finding it very difficult to make ends meet. They have commitments in their households. Those who are affected by this anomaly are deeply concerned and they should be included at a much earlier date in order to benefit from budget 2023, as was the case with the many people who received the increased fuel allowance and double payments and so on. I ask the Minister to please address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Another matter I wish to raise relates to foster carers. A case in this regard has been already made to the Minister by a particular group. This cohort fall short in their contributions towards a full State pension. I ask the Minister to examine that with a view to changing the system that is currently in place and ensuring that cohort of people, who give an invaluable service to the person who is ill, but also substitute in terms of the institutionalised care that might be needed if things were otherwise, are entitled, as they ought to be, to the contributions being allocated to them, and thereby entitled to a full pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> These are examples of small anomalies in the social welfare system that can be best worked out in a debate in the House, through which Members can bring their experiences and information to the attention of the Minister and make life easier for those affected by the issues we are raising.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I agree with Deputy O'Dea regarding the time allotted. It is the business of the Government Chief Whip, but it is a pity the valuable interaction with the Minister on Second Stage is not recognised with more speaking time.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">It is great to see the Ceann Comhairle back and that his alertness has not diminished in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I agree with Deputy McGuinness and commend the Minister on her acute understanding of different families in different anomalous situations and her capacity to respond in that regard. It is a feature of the Bill. Maybe her experience in credit unions has stood to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I commend her on the consistent progress she is making in tackling poverty. The latest data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that the number of families in consistent poverty has halved since 2016, down now to just 4%. That is still 4% too many but significant progress has been made. It is especially encouraging to see the substantial number of children being taken out of poverty. Key measures, such as the increase of nearly 60% in the child dependent payment, from less than €32 to €50, for a child of 12 or over, have helped in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">That has been very significant, especially in its extension to those on low pay who are in work. The national childcare scheme, though not in the Minister's remit, is also significant in extending support to families who really need it and have children who can benefit from early childhood education, and the opportunities to train and work, which the Minister has pioneered. The House should recall that Ireland has one of the most effective tax and welfare income schemes for tackling poverty and helping people in their position. This year's budget is particularly effective, and I commend the Minister and her colleagues on identifying families at risk who might otherwise have been overlooked, renters, carers, the low paid at work, and those with children and students. The help for those groups has been particularly significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> In the present climate, I also commend the Minister on her approach to energy poverty. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, told us before the budget that 30% of people were exposed to energy poverty but, after the budget, it concluded that those people had been protected. The budget has been very effective. At €1,324, the fuel scheme is now more than double what it was just four years ago. The broadening of the scheme to those aged 70 and over is very welcome. I particularly welcome the removal of the anomaly Deputy McGuinness talked about, that of those public servants who would have been excluded. Many of those people will get the household benefit of €1,750. Such older families will really benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The warmer homes scheme is very welcome because it is not just helping people this winter; it is helping them forevermore in their homes. A benefit of up to €2,000 for delivering those warmer home measures has now been extended to the low paid at work, those on domiciliary care allowance, those carers who are living in, and those on disability allowance who have children. This is a very significant, permanent shift in helping us to tackle poverty, especially energy poverty. </p>

          <p eId="para_610">It is very good to see the Ceann Comhairle back. I, too, commend the Minister on her work on the Social Welfare Bill, which is the largest package in the history of the State. It comes at a most important time, when families are facing difficulties with fuel price challenges and cost-of-living challenges generally. I also commend the Minister on the structure of the Bill. I recognise that these changes will take effect from January and will include the front-loading of direct cash payments and lump-sum payments to families who need them most at this time of the year, when heating is being turned back on and heating bills are going up. I commend the structure of that and note that this approach was not, unfortunately, adopted by Sinn Féin and critics of the Government. This is exactly the right approach to get money to people, when they need it, through the mechanisms that are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I particularly compliment the Minister on her focus on working families, an exceptionally important group. The changes to tax in the Finance Bill and the extension of the threshold for the working family payment, which is a very important change, support families at work who are under pressure. I again note that Sinn Féin took no such approach to support working families in the same way, which is so disappointing because it is something that should be supported right across the House. The Minister is aware of the number of times I have raised with her the changes we wanted to see to the domiciliary care allowance and its extension. I again thank her for her work on that. I also note that she has managed to introduce the first increase in that allowance since 2009, bringing it up to €330 a month. That comes on the back of last year's good progress on carers, where there was the first really significant extension to the income thresholds, and a savings disregard for that, for 14 years. These are exactly the sorts of values I want to see reflected in this House: support for carers and families who need it most and have a child or elderly person who needs extra care, or a child with a disability. I met one lady in Shankill last week who has given up her working life for a different life caring for her child and is afraid the increases to the carer's allowance will go some day. That is the big worry that keeps her awake at night. I tried to explain the approach of Fine Gael and the Minister, which is to extend eligibility and protect people in that group. It is so very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I will highlight the work around the extension to the fuel allowance generally, especially to the over-70s. So many people in my constituency are living in houses that have been paid for but, because there are no other places for them to move to, they are living in houses they cannot necessarily afford to heat. There is no discrimination in that; it can come to any house at any time. The extension the Minister has made to the fuel allowance, particularly for the over-70s, is an important statement of values for those we will not allow to get cold this winter or any winter. These are very important changes that the Minister has introduced. I commend her work on them and her constant focus on eradicating poverty and devoting resources to those who genuinely need them most. </p>

          <p eId="para_613">Cuirim fáilte ar ais romhat a Cheann Comhairle. Bhí tú sa Chathaoir cúpla uair ó shin. I will raise a few matters with the Minister. We have always had quite a good, constructive relationship. However, I need to respond to some of the points raised by an Teachta Cathal Crowe. He is not present in the Chamber. He is well able to dish it out but whether he can take it is a whole other question. The world and its mother can grasp Sinn Féin's pensions policy but clearly an Teachta Crowe cannot. I am more than happy to explain it to him so that he can grasp it. I also note his concern for the people of the North. It is refreshing to hear that from Fianna Fáil but, as far as Deputy Crowe is concerned, I am sure that it is all chat and absolutely no action. Again, it is disappointing that he did not hang around to hear some of the responses to his claims and his excitement.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I will return to a few of the issues I would like to raise with the Minister. The issue of cohabiting couples is one I have also raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, during the debate on the Finance Bill. As the Minister for Social Protection knows, cohabiting couples are assessed together for social welfare purposes but it is different when it comes to tax reliefs. Married couples get the tax relief but cohabiting couples do not. In fairness to the Minister for Finance, I had quite a good engagement with him on it. He said there were some issues in respect of certain court cases. It would be an interesting measure to look at, however. I note the Minister for Social Protection said in her statement yesterday that she had tried to take on board some of the suggestions made last year. It may be worth looking at the fact that cohabiting couples are assessed together for social welfare purposes but not when it comes to tax relief. That just does not seem fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> This is increasingly becoming an issue. Since I raised it, more people have contacted me regarding it. It raises real issues for those who are cohabiting. For example, one woman contacted me who was cohabiting with her husband while they went through a divorce. Of course, the housing situation means it is more difficult for people to be able to leave but the divorce was not on amicable terms and the joint assessment required by the Department of Social Protection made life very difficult for her because of her situation. As her soon-to-be ex-husband did not engage with this assessment, she was caught in limbo and was in a difficult financial position. This situation has also arisen a number of times in respect of pensioners and so on. Given the fact that cohabitation is treated differently in terms of tax and social welfare, it would be an interesting to see whether it could be considered for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> I will also flag the waiting times for claims. Other people have also raised this issue. I know of one lady on disability allowance who was reassessed and had to wait two months to get her payment. It is obviously backdated but the point is she was left in a very vulnerable position.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Mythen<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_617">A robust and adequate social welfare system is the cornerstone of any republic, the sworn duty and aim of which should be to look after the most vulnerable and the less well-off in society. The nation's population will be healthier and freer to enjoy their life, if they know there is a safety net for them and their families if they fall on hard times. In the current cost-of-living crisis, with soaring energy and food costs increasing daily, our social welfare system is needed now more than ever. This is why I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to raise some of the issues my office and I are dealing with on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> We must reform our social protection system by ensuring that all social welfare rates are adequate and protect those who are most at risk from poverty and deprivation. Despite a growing cost-of-living crisis, current social welfare rates are far behind where they need to be. Working age payments need to be brought up to a minimum essential standard-of-living system. The €12 weekly increase to core social welfare rates is inadequate, as this has been already swallowed up by the rate of inflation, the extra costs of the weekly shopping trolley, and a massive increase in utility bills. A €12 increase in this day and age is not enough to protect those reliant on social payments from poverty and does not recognise the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on those on fixed incomes, particularly old age pensioners and people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> Households will also have to wait until January 2023 to see these increases. Sinn Féin brought forward proposals to increase social welfare rates with effect from October, in order that people could see additional support in their pockets immediately. Turnaround times for some supports are causing unnecessary hardship, anxiety and mental stress on people who are already in very difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">My office is constantly dealing with people in County Wexford who are in dire need of the supplementary welfare allowance and the additional needs payment but are waiting for far too long for their applications to be processed. This backlog also puts additional pressures on already exhausted social welfare officers. I ask the Minister to take these issues seriously and put a resourced plan in place to address this backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I am also very concerned about energy poverty, especially in more rural areas like County Wexford. The announced expansion to the fuel allowance is welcome but very limited. There will be little additional eligibility for those households that would have been locked out of the scheme before this year's budget. Those who will gain from the changes to eligibility will not do so until January 2023. We in Sinn Féin have called for eligibility for the scheme to be expanded to working family payment recipients to target increased accessibility for the scheme among lower income working families with children.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> We also called for a discretionary fund to be established to provide a safety net for those outside of the eligibility criteria who might need support. I ask the Minister for her response to this proposal. It would make a huge difference to the lives of families in County Wexford and beyond and would ensure that they can stay warm this Christmas and throughout the winter. Insufficient heat is one of the measures of deprivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Overall, I welcome the increases in social welfare protections that this Bill will bring but I respectfully ask that the Minister give due consideration to the other issues raised. Right now, we must do all we can to protect people from poverty and the deprivation that it brings.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasGould" eId="spk_217">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_624">I wish to raise an issue that was raised with me by a constituent this week. His wife is on a community employment scheme but has recently gone on maternity leave. Because of this, they have lost their entitlement to the fuel allowance and the lump sums. These were payments they were waiting and depending on. I ask the Minister to consider this anomaly because I know there are a number of anomalies and to include women on maternity leave in those payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I think we can all agree on the Trojan work of my colleague and Sinn Féin spokesperson Deputy Kerrane in the area of social protection. When this Government was formed, our party president Deputy McDonald said Sinn Féin would be the most effective Opposition this State has ever seen. From the pandemic unemployment payment to the disability lump sum, Deputy Kerrane has put the Government under significant pressure to make changes to its policy. As a result, the Government has moved further in protecting vulnerable people. This shows what happens when you have constructive Opposition that holds the Government to account. Sinn Féin is not like Fianna Fáil under the confidence and supply agreement. Sinn Féin is showing real opposition and real leadership with real solutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Deputy Kerrane has submitted a number of amendments to this Bill and I ask the Minister to consider them seriously because they are constructive. The key issue we are trying to get across is that nobody should be forced to live in food, fuel or energy poverty. Nobody should go to bed hungry or cold. This must be the basic condition this Government must strive for. </p>
          <p eId="para_627"> It is going to be a tough winter. As I came into Leinster House this evening, you could feel the cold. It is all very well for us to be in a nice and warm Chamber with food at a reasonable price but many people will really feel the cold tonight and for the rest of the winter. This is why the Social Welfare Bill is so important. The Government needs to ensure a minimum standard of living. </p>
          <p eId="para_628"> We saw yesterday how the Government refused to admit that we are in a housing emergency. Today I hope the Minister does not shy away from the need to ensure that social welfare payments effectively take into account the cost of living. In 2020, we spent the lowest amount on social protection relative to GDP of any European state. It is not enough to recognise this. The system must be overhauled and we must put people first.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Backbench Deputies, particularly those from Fine Gael, came in here today and cried about the loss of social welfare officers in the community. It was their Government that did this. We have crocodile tears from backbenchers Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies. They should stand up and be counted and put social protection officers back in the communities where they belong.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">Otto von Bismarck said that politics is the art of the possible. We saw what was suddenly possible during the pandemic when the rule book went out the window and hospitals were effectively nationalised. It was suddenly clear to the Government that it was not possible to exist on the basic rates of social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> While I welcome recent discussions around linking social welfare rates to previous income, we must ensure we do not leave part-time workers and the lower paid behind. Social welfare rates should be based on a minimum essential standard of living. We in Sinn Féin want to reform our social protection system by ensuring that all social welfare rates are adequate and protect those who rely on them from poverty. The current social welfare rates are far behind where they need to be and this has been highlighted by the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> I met recently with a number of groups providing food bank services in south Kildare. They are doing great work in tackling food poverty but if we had a living wage for workers and an adequate safety net for those who lose their jobs or cannot work, they would not have to exist. The irony is that we have Government politicians looking for photo ops with these food banks, which is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> While there are good people working in our social welfare system, there is far too much red tape. All of the application forms need to be reviewed. The form for carer's allowance, for example, is 40 pages long. The whole system needs to be streamlined. Applications for disability allowance are taking three months to process. There are huge backlogs in supplementary welfare applications. People with no incomes are being forced to live hand to mouth while they wait on a decision. The Department is clearly under pressure. The Government must invest in the people necessary to bring the service into the 21st century and it needs to start paying a living wage to civil servants. New entrants are paid little more than the minimum wage. We should be leading by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> We also need to make it easier for people who have not been in good health in the past to get back to work. If someone starts a job or a business and his or her health does not hold up, he or she can often spend weeks trying to get back into the system. Sometimes the stress of failing becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We need to ensure they can hold on to entitlements for a reasonable period and can get their payment back immediately if necessary. The safety net will encourage them to take risks if they are able to. We have submitted a number of amendments around rates and criteria and I urge all Deputies to support them. Maybe Deputy Cathal Crowe might understand that as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_635">A considerable amount has already been said, particularly by my colleagues. Strangely enough, I am in agreement with them. We have laid it out in the sense that we will be bringing a number of amendments forward. I think even the Minister would accept from time to time that anomalies are created. In fairness, she dealt with the issue of the disability support grant not being paid to National Learning Centre students. That is to be welcomed. I like to think consideration would be given to the other amendments we are offering.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> In the long term, I like to think there would be agreement across the board that on some level, we need to take rate changes and scenarios like a tenner here, a fiver there and €12 there out of here and make sure we set what is a minimum essential standard for people. It would be difficult to argue against that. We need to look at the likes of a social welfare adequacy commission that would make these determinations on the basis of the inflation rate index linking with all the necessary pieces. We all know that whatever rules we had with regard to the economy have been thrown to the side in the past number of months. It is about ensuring people have those necessary protections. </p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I previously raised the issue of additional needs payments with the Minister. She spoke about the additional resources she was putting in with regard to that but there are still difficulties. A considerable number of people would not have considered additional needs payments previously but are under severe pressure. We all know about the energy crisis and the multiple crises with which people are dealing such as housing. That is something that needs to be looked at. I know it is a particular issue in Dundalk. It is having an impact with regard to people who have been offered social housing that has not been kitted out where someone does not necessarily have the funds to do that. </p>
          <p eId="para_638">On some level, even from my point of view, and that of the people in my office and some of our councillors, this is not freeing up the house these people were previously renting. We have limited resources in housing, and this is an issue we are not dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> As I said, I ask the Minister to look in a constructive manner at the amendments being put forward by Sinn Féin. Beyond this, we must all address the issue of the social welfare system in respect of it being fit for purpose, including catching people where necessary. We must also consider dealing with the idea of poverty. I refer to those removed from education, and all the rest of it, who need these added supports to allow us to bridge the gap and bring more people into the education system and the workforce.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_640">As the spokesperson on disability for my party, I wish to raise several concerns around disabled people. There are persistently low levels of employment among people with disabilities, despite a widespread desire for work and career aspirations which are held by many and could be realised with the correct supports. This has resulted in appallingly high levels of poverty and enforced deprivation across households headed by a person with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> Currently, the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities in Ireland is one of the highest in the EU, at 38.1%. Equally, EU figures show Ireland to be the country with the lowest employment rate among people with disabilities, at 32.3%. The Government has committed to addressing the additional cost of disability. The Indecon report, which was commissioned by the Minister's Department, found that people with a disability face a higher daily cost of living, yet measures have not been introduced which would fundamentally address this issue within the social welfare system. The Government could have used the opportunity of the budget to begin to address the major shortcomings in provision for people with disabilities and family carers, but it fell short of this. </p>
          <p eId="para_642"> While I welcome many of the measures announced in the budget, several areas require further attention. I will speak on several of them. There is a need for a review of the means test for disability-related supports. Current means-testing requirements can be very rigid and limiting for many people with disabilities due to being based on entire household income. Income thresholds also limit many disabled people from taking up employment, as they lose essential entitlements if they earn too much. The one cited to me most often is the medical card. People do not want to lose their medical card and basic payment. This particularly applies to those who work on commission, because they find then that they lose their payment if they get any sort of work on commission at all. There is also a problem if there is a change in the financial circumstances of the partners of those receiving the blind pension or disability allowance. If the household income goes up, blind or disabled people either lose their entitlement or their rate of payment is cut. My argument is that these people will not cease to be blind or disabled simply because their partner changes jobs or their salary increases. </p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Several of my colleagues have raised concerns about the delay in processing emergency payments of different types. I wish to include in this the application for rent allowance for someone fleeing domestic violence circumstances. I was informed of the case of one woman seeking this rent allowance who was told it would take five weeks. Luckily enough, the new landlady was aware of her circumstances and was understanding. She said she could wait for the payment. Not all landlords or landladies are able or willing to wait for a payment. I wrote to the Minister about this issue. I hope this is a once-off situation that can be addressed and will not happen again. I say this because some people may end up going back to a domestic violence situation and this is intolerable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_644">I thank the Minister for her response to the demanding and challenging situation we have faced over the last couple of years. Many issues were in need of attention and they received it. This was because the Minister clearly understood the issues being faced and was determined to respond to them in good time. We therefore owe her congratulations for this and we wish her well in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> We have limited time and I wish to touch on a couple of things. I like the Opposition. I enjoy the Opposition. John B. Keane once said to another Member of this House on television that "I enjoy you as a politician". In any event, the Opposition is a necessity and we need to hear from them as well. This does not, however, mean that Government backbenchers have no hearts or compassion or have hearts of stone. We meet our constituents on a fairly regular basis, perhaps more regularly than many people would give us credit for. We hear their stories first-hand. This is, of course, the best way to do it. By meeting people first-hand, we get a better understanding of what is in their minds and concerning them the most. I have noticed over the years that when people are in a potentially challenging situation, their innermost concerns and worries affect them greatly. They reach out at that stage for some help and some sign or some way through the haze. This is a natural thing. Ordinarily, and during the recession it was not always possible to do this, it is greatly important that we reach out to those people at that stage to stabilise them. It is also important from our point of view when we meet our constituents in clinics to reassure them that whatever the situation is, it can be resolved, we can tackle it and deal with it and there is a way around it. This is reassurance and it is hugely helpful to these people in the context of providing for their families and themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Two other things came to my mind, which are not necessarily the responsibility of the Minister. The body charged with the responsibility to make determinations on higher education grants often has the attitude of offering half of the grant rate. Half of a grant, though, deprives a child of the opportunity of going to third level education. People might as well not get it at all. The obvious thing to do is to award the full grant and if investigations may not prove fruitful afterwards, it could be withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I also wish to mention those people, self-employed or otherwise, who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a pension. When I was in the Minister's Department, which is a long time ago now, I did some work in this area. Unfortunately, some of it had to be reversed afterwards. My belief is that people who have made contributions during their years of employment, whatever that employment may have been, whether self-employment or otherwise, and made those contributions in good faith, have a constitutional entitlement to some pension arising from it, albeit a limited one. In other words, if people may have made only 50% of the required contributions, then they should get that 50% pension. They can then get the rest by way of a means-tested pension if they are in that category. The important thing, though, is to enable people in this situation to qualify for the pension they would be entitled to based on their contributions. If such a pension is not sufficiently big, then there is also the means-tested system.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> All of us here would like much more time to discuss this issue because it affects the social fabric of our society. This is important from all our perspectives, whether we are in the Opposition or the Government, and whether we are backbenchers, Ministers or whatever. I thank the Minister for being here, for listening and for being of a mind to do what was necessary when it had to be done, because we had nothing else.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">I am pleased to be discussing this legislation and the changes that will come in as a result of budget 2023. Our social protection system, and our social welfare system before that, has always been instrumental when it comes to supporting and protecting people when they need help the most, whether through times of illness or unemployment or when people reach an older age or need maternity benefit or carers' allowance, etc. There are so many other instances in which we supply help when people need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and now during this cost-of-living crisis, we have seen the importance and value of supporting people and protecting jobs when this needs to happen. This is what we are now continuing to do with budget 2023. In 2021, almost €3 out of every €10 spent by the Government was on social protection measures. We supported more than 3 million people last year through the 85 million individual payments made. This accounted for more than €30.8 billion in spending. This Bill will allow us to continue to support the most vulnerable in our society. There are some really positive measures in this Bill, too many to go through in the couple of minutes I have. I wish to highlight in particular, though, the benefits for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">There were 27,108 recipients of maternity benefit between July and September this year. This Bill will increase the rate for maternity benefit from €250 to €262 per week to support mothers in those vital first few months of a child's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> It was Fine Gael in government which introduced paternity benefit in 2016 - a massive step forward in recognising the important role that both parents play in a child's life. It is time to look at extending paternity benefit beyond two weeks. That is something I would wholeheartedly support and perhaps something we might look to in future budgets. I welcome that paternity benefit will also be increased to €262 per week along with adoptive benefit and parent's benefit. We first introduced parent's benefit in 2019. This has been increased from two to seven weeks per parent and is taken in the first two years following birth or adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Research shows that when it comes to taking time away from work to care for children, it is still mostly mothers who do it. Even though benefits and leave have increased for fathers in recent years, uptake has remained somewhat low. Many fathers in particular feel the effects that taking leave may have when it comes to their career. However, I am encouraged that the number of fathers claiming parent's benefit is now on the rise. In 2021, only 28% of applicants claiming the benefit were male. In 2022, this had increased to 35%.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Coming from the corporate world, I have a big interest in gender diversity in the workplace. While we have made strides, the adherence to old-fashioned gender norms about who should work and who should mind children in families made up of a mother and a father can still be present, in particular when it comes to workplaces. I welcome the increase in fathers claiming parent's benefit and taking that time off. I reiterate a call I made previously in this House to employers to support parents within their organisation and encourage them to avail of the full parental supports available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> On top of the increases in maternity and paternity benefit rates, the Social Welfare Bill will also see a €40 increase in working family payment thresholds, a €12 increase in the maximum rate of all other core weekly payments, a €20.50 increase in domiciliary care allowance, a €30,000 increase in the savings disregard for fuel allowance for older people, extended eligibility for participation on community employment, CE, schemes and an increase in earnings attracting the lower employee PRSI rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> In the cost-of-living crisis, our focus is on putting money back in people's pockets, on supporting families, on supporting individuals and supporting businesses with energy bills and rising inflation. I thank the Minister because that is exactly what the Bill sets out to achieve.</p>

        <speech by="#CormacDevlin" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_660">I welcome the opportunity to examine the Social Welfare Bill 2022, which gives effect to the changes announced in budget 2023 as announced by the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, on 27 September last.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> This cost-of-living budget will help families to cope with the impact of rising costs of living. There is no trickle-down side to this. There will be a direct and substantial aid to those most in need. This month alone will see people on half a dozen schemes receive lump-sum payments such as the €400 cost-of-living fuel allowance payment to all households getting the fuel allowance, the €200 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the living alone allowance, the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum to all families getting the working family payment, the double payment of child allowance to support all families with children, the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for people getting the carer's support grant as well as the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum disability support grant which will be paid to all people getting a long-term disability payment. The single biggest measure, costing nearly €900 million, is the permanent increase in the social welfare payment of €12 - the largest ever increase in these payments and part of the largest ever social protection package.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> In Fianna Fáil, we reject the Opposition's proposal to give less to pensioners. Pensioners deserve our support and we will continue to oppose the idea that they should be treated unequally.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> These increases will apply to all people who receive a principal social welfare payment. More people will qualify for the working family payment, the qualified child allowance and the fuel allowance, which is being increased, as are the payments to carers and people on CE schemes. Of course, this is on top of benefiting from the other once-off measures addressing inflation which I have mentioned. The one-off payments to people are welcome and necessary. I will single out one change as important. The expansion of the fuel allowance scheme to people over 70 years of age is extremely significant. A couple over 70 with an income of up to €1,000 per week will be eligible for fuel allowance for the first time ever from January 2023. This significant change will benefit thousands of households, not only in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire but across Ireland. I raised this issue of people with a modest pension being locked out of the fuel allowance scheme during the summer, when I called for that threshold to be increased. I thank the Minister and her colleagues in government for taking that suggestion on board. I would ask that a publicity campaign be launched to ensure that people are aware of this significant change and that there is sufficient staff within the Department to deal with the increased volume of applications that no doubt will follow. It is important that people get that.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Finally, I join my colleagues in expressing concern about the community welfare office system. Recent changes have led to community welfare officers being one step further removed from the individuals who are most in need of financial support. Emergency appointments are extremely hard to obtain for people. Those physically present in the community welfare offices are not dealing with a much larger volume of calls, callers or those seeking their assistance. Certainly, the recent changes need to be evaluated to ensure we keep that kind of direct contact. All public representatives in this House are receiving a higher volume of requests from people who are in dire straits of various different degrees, be it financial or otherwise, and need to avail of the community welfare office system, which is a fantastic system. We need to ensure it is front-facing and welcoming to those most in need.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_227">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_665">First of all, I thank the Minister and compliment her for the tremendous job that she has done since she went into the Department of Social Protection. As somebody along with others who was putting pressure on the Government and the Minister to respond in this budget to people who were finding it very difficult out there, I thought that the Minister did a very good job. Of course, people are finding it difficult, but the Minister did a superb job going into Government and fighting for the money that we needed to get. Any money that is given to people who need it is money that is welcome and I compliment the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I also compliment the Minister on her staff in the Department of Social Protection. I would like to put on the record of the Dáil that I wish there were more Ministers like the Minister and more Departments like the Department of Social Protection. I refer to the answers to Dáil questions I get back here on a daily basis. The public service is blocking democracy but the point about the Department of Social Protection is that if one puts down a Dáil or writes to the Department, one will get a response. It might not be the response that one will want, but one will get a response. One will get the facts of what is happening from the Department, not like other Departments. I send back questions every day to the Ceann Comhairle because I have received no response from a Department. I would like to put on the record my request to the Minister to try to get more staff because they are under pressure, particularly with the Ukrainian refugees. However, they have done the job and they have to be complimented for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> There is one issue I would like to raise with the Minister in relation to the qualified allowance. This is where women or men, if their husband or wife is getting a social welfare pension and their wife or husband is looking for the qualified allowance, have to get permission from their spouse to be able to get that payment. I ask the Minister to bring in legislation at some stage to deal with that. It is wrong that the partner has to ask the husband or wife for permission to get that payment in her or his own right. I would like if the Minister would look at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> Finally, in relation to the fuel allowance, the Minister did a fantastic job. For a couple, the threshold is approximately €1,000. For a single person, it is a bit less. For the single person, the Minister might try to look at the means test to allow them a little more to be able to qualify for the fuel allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The Minister did a superb job. Her Department did a superb job. I know that the Minister will be fighting to get more when people need it, and they do need it. The Minister has done a superb job and I compliment her on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">The simple fact about the situation for the vast majority of people on middle and low incomes, working people, or people dependent on pensions or social welfare is that they will be worse off next year than they were this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">This is the fundamental fact. As much as the Government may try and bedazzle people with a long list of measures it has taken to try to mitigate the absolutely diabolical cost-of-living and housing crisis that people face, this is the fact. The official rate of inflation is running at 8.1% but, of course, as everybody that examines these matters, such as the ESRI, has made clear, the inflation rate for people on lower incomes is higher. It is the highest for those who have the least because they spend most of their income on the things that have seen shocking increases in cost and price, whether food, energy or housing. The people who have the least are suffering the most. The vast majority of people will be poorer next year than they were this year. Meanwhile there is another group of people for whom it will be much better next year. It was better for them this year than it was last year and it was better last year than the year before. This is the truth that is never mentioned in these debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> There are a few facts in this regard that are worth putting on the record. Energy poverty in this country is at an all-time high of 29% of the population. It is shocking to think that just under one third of the population is suffering from energy poverty. It is estimated that if current trends of energy cost increases continue this figure will increase to 43%. This is almost double its previous recorded high of 23% in 1994 and 1995. If this trend continues, just under half of the population will soon suffer energy poverty. More generally, according to Social Justice Ireland when housing costs are taken into account, 19% of the population is living in poverty or on the poverty line. This is 935,000 people, including 300,000 children. Almost one in five of the population lives on or below the poverty line when energy and housing costs are taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> It is a very different story for others. The median pay package of top CEOs last year increased by 42% to an average of €2 million each in pay. Oxfam stated in a report produced earlier this year that the wealth of Ireland's nine richest billionaires increased in just one year by €15 billion. This is not how much they have; this is how much their wealth increased in one year. That brought the total wealth of nine individuals to €51 billion. We cannot even imagine how rich these people are. A report on the pay of directors for Irish companies shows that many of them recorded maximum bonus payments in 2021. While everybody else was getting poorer and being hammered with the cost-of-living and housing crisis the directors of companies, or most of them, received massive bonus payments. Last year, the average non-executive director, which is basically a part-time job sitting in on a few board meetings, was paid on average €107,000. The average for executive directors was close to €1 million for sitting on a company board. Look at how well these companies were doing while other people were being crushed.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Electric Ireland made an additional €63 million in 2021, with profits reaching €679 million, yet in March this year it announced price increases of almost 25% and further increases in August of 11% for electricity and 32% for gas. That affects 1.2 million households. Bord Gais operating profits grew 74% in the first half of 2022 to €39.4 million. In the previous year, they were only €19 million. Bord Gais increased its prices twice in September 2021. Its domestic customers now pay an average of €760 more for electricity and €573 more for gas than last year. Overall estimates suggest that over the past year and next year most households will have lost between €4,000 and €6,000 in real terms because of the rise in the cost of living, housing costs and inflation. These are savage income cuts in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It is also briefly worth mentioning the wealth figures. The richest 5% of people in this country amount to 93,000 households. Between them this group has €388 billion. It may be of interest to the public out there that net household wealth in this country has now reached more than €1 trillion for the first time. We are the fourth richest country in the world. There is a problem with the distribution of that wealth. According to TASC and the only study the Government did on this in recent years in 2017, the richest 10% of our population own 53% of the wealth but the least well off 50% of the population has 1.4% of the wealth. The average wealth of the richest 93,000 households in this country is €4 million whereas we have one fifth of the population living in poverty and this situation is getting worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> Against this background what did the Government do in the budget to address the situation? It provided a 5% increase for pensioners and social welfare recipients, which is €12 per week. According to Social Justice Ireland the necessary level of income per week to be sure of not suffering poverty is €286. The weekly pension went from €253 to €265. This is €21 short of the poverty line. This is the reality. While we are thinking about this, let us not forget about the 93,000 richest households, which have €4 million each in wealth, never mind income. The vast majority of those dependent on the State pension are, in effect, living in poverty or a very close to it. We have a 5% increase when inflation is officially running at 8% but in actuality is approximately 9% or more for those low-income households that spend most of their income on food and heating. There is no change to the basic rates of fuel allowance, living alone allowance, domiciliary care allowance, carer's support grant, back to school clothing and footwear allowance or child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Many people went out on the Cost of Living Coalition protest in advance of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">There is no doubt the Minister was changing the figures over that weekend because we managed to get 20,000 people out on the streets. She was put under pressure and we got some one-off payments. I am sure everybody will be glad of those payments, but they are going to disappear into the pockets of the CEOs and executive board directors and the profits of the companies I mentioned. All that money is heading into their pockets. It will be gone come the new year. By the end of the winter months, the reality will kick in that, in terms of a basic income, people received less than the rate of inflation and the rises in the cost of living. They will be poorer next year than they were last year. That will be the reality once those one-off payments disappear. None of this would be necessary if there was a willingness to make a small increase in the tax burden of companies and extraordinary wealthy households that have become more extraordinarily wealthy and profitable in the past year or two and redirect that towards ensuring nobody in this country lives in poverty, everybody can afford a roof over their head and heating and food prices are affordable. That is the big picture as far as I am concerned. A few sticking plasters will not deal with the gaping wound of deprivation, poverty, housing misery and energy poverty that huge numbers of people are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Beyond those general points, I will make a few specific points. A child over 16 years may be entitled to a disability payment while he or she is at school. However, I discovered that if the mother applies for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for the child going back to school, she will be refused the allowance, unbelievably, because the child is getting a disability payment. Just so the Minister knows, the mother is not allowed to take the disability payment off her child. The child gets the disability payment because he or she has a disability and he or she is entitled to it. That is the child's income. The idea that the mother does not get money for the back-to-school costs, because the child is on a disability payment, is frankly obscene. This needs to be addressed immediately. It is shocking and, in reality, it is a form of discrimination against people with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The husband of a very unwell woman came into my clinic. She is ten years on illness benefit. The rules around illness benefit were changed in 2009 so that a person could only be on it for two years. Prior to that, there were long-term recipients of illness benefit. When that change came in, people were given the option to stay on illness benefit if they thought it was the best payment for them, and this woman did so. As a result, even though she has been on that payment for ten years, she has been denied the fuel allowance all those years. She was also denied the one-off cost-of-living payment of €400, and I have received replies to parliamentary questions to that effect. In case the department official is passing a note to the Minister saying the woman can apply for other allowances, she did that and was denied them both.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">If she is entitled to illness benefit, she should be entitled to the fuel allowance, which she should have been getting for the past nine years, as well as the cost-of-living payment. The Minister should do something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> Beyond that, I see no justification for why people on illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, death benefit, injury benefit, or carer's benefit should not have the fuel allowance. Why should they not have it? There is no good reason for this. They will suffer during the coldest winter. They are suffering with the increases in bills. Just because of their short-term payment, based on their PRSI contributions, they are refused fuel allowance. That is outrageous and the fuel allowance should be extended to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Deputy Devlin said it was good that the income thresholds for the fuel allowance, people in receipt of pensions, people aged over 70 or for people under 70 on a State pension have increased. I accept that is a positive measure. I received an answer from the Minister to a parliamentary question that stated she does not intend to advertise that fact in January. There will be no public information campaign. I suggest that she holds a public information campaign, in January, that is broadcast, loud and clear, informing people to check whether the new means thresholds will mean they are entitled to the allowance. It should be broadcast from the rooftops, on the radio and television that people may be entitled to the fuel allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> The autumn bonus double payment was included for some benefits but not illness benefit. Why not? I do not see why it should not be included. People are off work as a result of illness. Just because it is short term does not mean they are any less affected by the cost-of-living crisis, winter costs and so on. Unless the Minister will say otherwise, I assume all the people who do not receive the double payment will also not get the double payment at Christmas. They should get the double payment at Christmas because they need it just as much as everyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Those are my points, which I hope the Minister will address. They are anomalies, which is a nice word for them. They are injustices. On the wider issue, the Government has to do a lot more.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> On the question of how we pay for all this, one way would be through employer PRSI contributions. In our budget, which was costed by the Department of Social Protection, People Before Profit suggested a new PRSI rate of 19.75% to be paid by employers for employees who are paid more than €90,000 per year. It would pertain to a relatively small cohort, for whom they would have an increased PRSI contribution and would raise €866 million in one year. We have some of the lowest employer PRSI rates in Europe. If we were to slightly increase the 11.5% rate to 13.05%, we would raise €1.5 billion, a calculation that was costed by the Minister's Department. If a relatively small increase were made to the lower rate of employer PRSI and to the higher rate of employer PRSI for the highest earners, we could raise €2.3 billion. That would go a long way to redistributing some of the wealth in this country to alleviate poverty and energy poverty in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> The Minister will be aware of a study that suggests the average additional costs can be between €9,000 and €12,000 per year for those with a disability. Where in the Bill is the premium, on an ongoing basis, for people with disabilities to compensate them for the €9,000 to €12,000 additional cost they incur? We should do that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_694">The main reason I wish to speak on the legislation relates to patients with long Covid, many of whom are young with no underlying health conditions. They are presenting with prolonged multi-system symptoms that are impacting on their daily lives, affecting their ability to work and causing significant disability for some. Long Covid is having a significant impact on our labour force. An Australian study produced on long Covid indicated that even low rates of Covid-related permanent illness or disability could lead to significant future societal burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Long Covid is costing at least €500 million in lost work and welfare alone. Data from the Minister's Department has shown that 0.81% of those who contracted Covid-19 and claimed the enhanced illness benefit payment were medically certified as unfit for work 12 weeks later. If that is extrapolated across the total number of people infected with Covid-19 in the adult population, it equates to 21,459 adults who are unfit to work or hold down a job. If that is extrapolated over a six-month timeframe, it equates to €586 million in lost wages and welfare payments alone, never mind the impact long Covid is having on our overburdened health service. On a population basis, more than 21,000 people may be unfit to work due to long Covid. That excludes those who have relapsed after the initial recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 infection or the tens of thousands more experiencing less severe forms of long Covid who have had reduced participation while still in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The sad fact for many of these people is that trying to get access to care and treatment is nearly impossible. On average, they wait six months to access long Covid clinics and, if they happen to be in Dublin, they are waiting more than 12 months. At the same time, the Mater hospital long Covid clinic, which treats neurological conditions such as brain fog associated with long Covid, is set to close at the end of this year. Many patients are being forced to travel abroad to access treatment because of the lack of clear referral and treatment pathways in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> The Minister will recall that on 9 November, my colleagues in the Regional Group and myself secured the unanimous support of this House for a motion on the issue of long Covid. There were two provisions in that motion. which was unanimously adopted by the House. One of them was to "ensure that all healthcare and frontline workers who are unfit to work due to long Covid are entitled to special leave with the removal of the arbitrary eligibility date of 7th February, 2022, for healthcare workers and further ensure that the current scheme does not abruptly cease in June 2023".</p>
          <p eId="para_698">For some bizarre reason, the health service, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has set an arbitrary date in that someone in the health service had to have contracted Covid at least 84 days prior to 7 February of this year and be out of work for that period to get extended leave until June of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> We actively supported and encouraged front-line healthcare workers to go in to work during the depths of this pandemic at a time we did not know what this virus was doing or have access to vaccination. We are now setting arbitrary dates without any justification as to why these dates were being plucked out of the sky. I know of two healthcare workers who contracted the virus last January. They were young, fit, capable women who are still out of work today and, because of the system in place, they are living on fresh air as their entitlements have been exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> The key issue with regard to all of this and the reason I am bringing this up with the Minister is we need to recognise long Covid as an occupational illness for all healthcare workers and other front-line workers. To do that, we need her to act under section 87 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the 2007 regulations introduced on occupational injuries and bring forward an amendment to those regulations to allow for long Covid to be considered an occupational injury for front-line workers. </p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Under those particular regulations and section 87(2) of the primary legislation, it states that a condition where there is a risk to a person's occupation that is not common to the population as a whole should be considered under this scheme. The reality is that the vast majority of front-line healthcare workers who contracted long Covid did so at a time a vaccine was not available. However, those workers continued to go in during the height of the surge in the most recent variants. The Minister and I spoke earlier and she told me that a substantial amount of the additional €16 million in the Social Insurance Fund was down to the surge in the Omicron variant earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> The workers who went to the front line of our health service during the Omicron peak to treat patients in hospital and ended up contracting Covid-19 and remaining out of work due to long Covid are denied any support at present. I ask the Minister to amend the regulations to include long Covid as an occupational injury in those circumstances. This change is happening in other countries throughout Europe. Denmark has brought it in and Israel, Italy, Latvia, Norway and Slovenia are doing it at present. The European Commission has recognised long Covid as an occupational illness yet we are not prepared to do that here for our own front-line healthcare workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The difficulty is that healthcare workers have an arbitrary date when they will be completely knocked off benefits. Other front-line workers, who are not healthcare workers, are getting no support whatsoever because they did not get the extended leave. I know one healthcare worker who was a clinical specialist physiotherapist within our health service. She is a very young, fit woman who has, since the beginning of this year, gone to the private Covid clinic in the Beacon centre and for private MRI and ear, nose and throat, ENT, appointments in Tullamore. She has attended the public Covid clinic in Galway but has also gone to private appointments in Dublin with Dr. Jack Lambert. At this point, this woman is paying €120 per month for essential Sublyme capsules; €65 per month for a multivitamin treatment; €30 per month for a probiotic treatment; €30 per month for melatonin and €25 per month for Naltrexone. The bills go on and on. This is someone who went to work because the Government asked her to do so to provide care for people who were ill and who went in during surge after surge and wave after wave of Covid-19 to work in our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Now the State is turning its back on those individuals and it will turn its back on many more next June. That is only the healthcare workers, not to mention other front-line workers. When we had this debate in the House earlier this month, colleagues from all sides spoke about front-line workers, including teachers, who contracted Covid-19 in school. Some were in special schools, providing supports to children with a disability. They are being denied any support from the State, which is turning its back on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> On top of those public sector workers, at least 4,000 people were still out of work 12 weeks after they contracted Covid. They were medically certified by the Minister's Department to be unfit for work. I believe they are only the tip of the iceberg in this matter. We need to recognise this as an occupational illness. I hope the Minister will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> In the time that is left, I want to raise one other issue with her. We need a root-and-branch overhaul of our tax and welfare system in this country to ensure that work always pays. People should always be financially better off in work than on the live register or claiming welfare. The systems are built against people. The evidence is that where people work and are able to actively participate in the labour market, they are financially better off. Research was published by the ESRI earlier this year into the impact of one-parent family payment reforms on the labour market outcomes for lone parents. There was a lot of criticism when these changes were brought in back in 2015 but the conclusion of the ESRI research is that the reforms led to an increase in the average hours worked by lone parents. Household income increased by between 9% and 12%. There was an increase of between 23% and 29% in earnings from employment. There are clearly many incentives to support people in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> One area that has not been reformed in years and is now a major barrier to people gaining employment is medical card income thresholds, which have not been increased in 17 years. In that period, both the Minister and her predecessors have increased the basic rate of social welfare by €71.20, yet medical card income thresholds have not increased. Everyone in receipt of a social welfare payment is technically over the income limit for the medical card. However, they are given on a discretionary basis to people who are on social welfare, but if people earn €1 on top of their social welfare payment, they are automatically denied the medical card. That is a basic barrier to work and I ask the Minister to consider it.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_708">I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me some of his time. I also thank Deputies for their contributions. There has been good engagement. There were always going to be some areas where there were differences, but there has been a broad welcome for the measures in the Bill from all sides of the House. We can never do everything we want in a single budget. There will always be more requests and things that we would like to do. We have struck a fair balance. All analyses shows that the budget is positive, particularly for the most vulnerable. The ESRI stated that the weekly welfare increases, together with the once-off measures, will mean that low-income households will be better off next year than they would if we had just increased welfare rates in line with inflation. There was another this morning from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. It states the Government has the balance right between protecting vulnerable households and avoiding adding to inflation. Any fair-minded person would say that we have got much right in the budget. I would love to do more. There are many things that we would all love to do, but we cannot do it all. We have to try to do things incrementally. We have made some important changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Many Deputies raised the community welfare service. The delivery of this crucial service is a priority for me and my Department. I will use this opportunity to update the House. Where people have an urgent need, we want to make sure they can get support. We had a major communications campaign to raise awareness of the additional needs payment. That campaign has worked. We know that because the numbers applying for and receiving the payments has increased. As of October 2022, more than 75,000 applications for additional needs payments have been processed and awarded. This represents a 63% increase in awarded applications compared with the same period in 2021. We have paid an estimated €46 million in additional needs payments so far this year. It is important to say that some of this increase can be attributed to the response to support families arriving from Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> Generally, where it is clear that people have an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure that they receive a payment on the same day. We all deal with community welfare officers, CWOs, through our constituency offices. When CWOs recognise that there is a clear and urgent need, they are normally good at making sure people are looked after and receive a payment as quickly as possible. Where an application is complete and the required documentation is supplied, it is processed quickly. Where there are delays, it is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from people to support their applications. My Department has taken a number of steps to simplify and streamline the process for persons applying for additional needs payments. A major public information campaign has been run throughout the year to raise awareness of the payment. We know many people have never been to a CWO and, therefore, we established a new national helpline and phone number people can ring to get advice. There is also a full-time CWO presence in all 50 Intreo offices nationwide from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday. CWOs remain available to attend clinics. They can talk to people over the phone. When needed, they can also arrange a house visit by appointment. We are doing everything we can to facilitate and help people.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> There are 412 people across all grades in the community welfare service. In light of the increased number of applications, as part of the budget, we secured agreement for approximately 74 additional to be assigned to the community welfare offices. Recruitment of additional staff has commenced and it is anticipated that they will be in place by the first quarter of 2023. In the interim, until these staff have been recruited, 30 social welfare inspectors have been temporarily reassigned to the community welfare service since the start of November to assist with claims processing. While we will not have a full picture until the end of the year, we have started to see a fall-off in applications for additional needs payments over the past few weeks. This can probably be attributed to the various lump sum payments that have been paid out in recent weeks and helped to reduce the financial pressure that many people face. If Deputies have examples of delays, I ask them to pass them on to me or my Department. I commit to looking at those specific instances that are brought to my attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The national minimum wage was mentioned here. It will not negatively affect a full-time worker from the point of view of PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Some Deputies said there was nothing in the budget for lone parents. That is completely wrong. The budget 2023 expenditure report notes that lone parent households stand to benefit from an annual increase in support of €1,872. Analysis using the ESRI's SWITCH model shows that, of household types, lone parents and single retired people benefit the most in proportionate terms from social welfare budget 2023 measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Recipients of the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment received a double weekly payment in October and will also receive a Christmas bonus double payment in December. Like all families with children, lone parents received a double child benefit payment on 1 November. Lone parents in receipt of the fuel allowance also received a lump sum payment of €400 in November. Half of the payments of the €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment made to recipients of the working family payment in November went to lone parents. There are many lone parents on the working family payment and they were able to benefit from the €500 lump sum.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Budget 2023 also provided for a €40 increase in the weekly income threshold for the working family payment and the personal rate of working-age payments such as one-parent family payment will increase by €12 from €208 to €220 per week, also from January. As I announced last week, I intend to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to disregard child maintenance payments from the social welfare means test. That, too, will be a big help to lone parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> Another Deputy said working families get nothing. That is a sound bite and is not true. There is a comprehensive tax package to support working families. They will benefit from the universal energy credit of €600 and from the reduction in childcare costs. Where my Department is concerned, all families will benefit from the double child benefit payment. In addition, low-income working families will also benefit from the €500 lump sum and the expansion of the working family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Deputy Flaherty raised the issue of recipients of disablement benefit not receiving fuel allowance. I am pleased to say that both disablement benefit and half-rate carer's allowance will be disregarded from the means test for fuel allowance. I acknowledge the Oireachtas joint committee, which suggested this change. I was heartened to hear the widespread support from all the Deputies for the new over-70s fuel allowance scheme. This will kick in on 1 January. I am aware everybody wanted the scheme introduced today, yesterday or on the day of the budget but we must ensure the IT systems work and that when we put these measures through, we do so in a way that is safe and that payments reach the people they are meant to reach.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_728">In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_729">
            <b>“Reports</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_730"><b>2. </b>Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the cost to the exchequer of abolishing the USC and replacing it with a High Income Social Charge of 10 per cent on all earnings over €90,000.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">This amendment asks the Dáil to look at the cost of abolishing the universal social charge, USC, and replacing it with a higher income social charge of 10% on all earnings over €90,000. I will also make reference to amendment No. 3 in my comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> The argument is very simple. We discussed it on Committee Stage but it is still important. I would not underestimate the sense of grievance working people still feel over the imposition of the USC. The Minister knows, but it is worth recalling, that working people in this country took an unprecedented hit for a financial and economic crisis that was not their fault. They had played no hand, act or part in creating it. It was a crisis entirely the responsibility of gambling bankers, gambling property developers and speculators and successive Governments that facilitated a sort of gold rush when it came to making money from property. That had dire consequences for this country and, it is worth saying, globally. That is not just a sort of history lesson because we are on so many different levels still dealing with the consequences of that, both in this country and internationally. The lesson has not been learned about the folly of turning to speculation on property for profit. It is still going on. It is still at the back of our current housing disaster and it crashed the entire global economy. It seems very few lessons were learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> The point with this amendment is it was working people who took the hit. One of the most egregious hits taken, which people are still suffering, was the imposition of the USC, which resulted in a dramatic increase in the tax burden on ordinary workers. I do not have the figures directly to hand but I think I am roughly correct in saying that prior to the USC, workers were in total paying about €23 billion between them in tax. That jumped to well over €30 billion as a result of the USC and the various austerity measures taken. It is worth pondering those sorts of figures. That was a dramatic increase in the burden of tax imposed on working people. This year, in what is being considered a bumper year for corporation tax receipts, all the corporations in this country will yield €20 billion in corporation tax receipts. The gross profits being recorded by those companies, in the latest available figures, were €193 billion, which is far in excess of what the total aggregate earnings of PAYE workers are. On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister if he had estimates of what corporate profits were for 2022 given that he was able to project a possible €21 billion coming in via corporation tax receipts. Looking at the pattern of all the previous years, that would suggest there was an enormous jump in corporate profits in 2021 or 2022, or both, to allow us to get from a figure of €11 billion being paid in corporation tax in 2020 up to the currently projected €21 billion. Maybe the Minister could enlighten us on that. Either way, the net point is that all the workers in this country combined earn less in gross income than all the corporations earn in gross profits but the workers pay much more tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">That is fundamentally unfair. A major contributory factor to that unfairness and inequality in who earns the most and pays the most is the universal social charge. That worsened an already iniquitous situation. Although the Government has made some adjustments to the universal social charge over the intervening years, it is still a very significant burden in people's pay cheques every week or month. It should be got rid of and we believe it could be paid for by first introducing the high earner income social charge I mentioned. Before the Minister says the charge we are proposing would not cover the full cost of abolishing the universal social charge, I will just say, as I said on Committee Stage and as we have made clear, that it is not the only measure we would take. We would also introduce new bands of income tax for the highest earners. There would be four bands for those earning in excess of €100,000. Between those two measures, we would cover the cost of abolishing the USC. That is not to mention the many other measures we proposed in our alternative budget, which I have here in front of me and which the Minister acknowledged he does actually read. Fair play to him. It sets out a number of other additional tax measures that would be taken to cover the cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_735">I wish to speak to amendment No. 70, which is about income tax. Looking at the impact of the permanent changes in the budget, the reality is there are big issues in relation to the distributional effects of what is being done in tax, which will result in those changes being very regressive. In the last decade or so, successive Ministers have prided themselves on the fact that we have a genuinely progressive income tax system but the tax changes that were introduced in this budget would reverse that - they will make it regressive. It is impossible to see a justification for what has been done around income tax, where changes were made under the heading of indexation. Indexation is supposed to relate to wage increases. There is a case and justification for indexing the tax bands to allow for wage inflation but not to allow for overall inflation. That has been a problem. It is also a misrepresentation of what our tax system actually does. I have heard more than one Minister, including very senior Ministers, refer to the fact that we need to index our tax system to allow for inflation. We do not. That is not indexation. They have also said people are paying more tax because of inflation. That is something the Tánaiste said. He said people on middle incomes, as he called them, are paying more tax as a result of inflation. They are not. They are paying more tax because of wage inflation. Wage inflation is quite low; I think it was about 2.4% in the year up to the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> There is no justification on any grounds, whether grounds of fairness, equality or progressivity, to index the higher rate of tax in line with inflation. All that does is give a tax benefit to everybody who earns over €36,800. What exactly is the justification for that? Why is the Minister doing that? He is giving a significant tax benefit to everybody who earns over that level. Why would he do that for people on very high incomes? For example, why should anybody in this House get a tax benefit? We do not have a difficulty. All our bills are going up but everybody in this House has the capacity to absorb that increase in the cost of living pretty well without it impacting on any of us too much. That is at the level of Deputies. Then there is the level of Ministers of State, Ministers, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and so on. What is the justification for giving that tax benefit to people who are high earners? Beyond those in here, there are many people earning in excess of what the Taoiseach is earning, for example, lots of higher civil servants and the many people in the private sector who are earning, in some cases, multiples of what Deputies earn. I cannot see any justification for giving a tax benefit to people earning over €100,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats proposed a clawback. If the Government is going to index the higher tax band, and if it is serious about fair distribution and maintaining progressivity in our tax system, then it must have a clawback at the higher end. The Social Democrats proposed a third rate of tax at 43% that would apply to individual incomes over €100,000, with adjustments for married couples and so on. That is what is proposed in amendment No. 70. The Minister talks about fairness a lot. He has been under extreme pressure from his party leader, the Tánaiste, to do something even more unfair by introducing a 30% tax rate. I am glad he did not go with that, at least in this budget. All the signals indicate that the Government is going to further erode the tax base. The Minister made that point very clearly in his budget statement. He started a process of eroding the tax base and making it less progressive in this budget. For the life of me, I cannot understand what the justification is. What is the rationale for doing that? I would appreciate if the Minister could outline that.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> My amendment, No. 70, requests that the Minister arrange for a report to be done and to report back to this House on the impact of this change, including who the beneficiaries are, how many beneficiaries there are and the income levels at which those beneficiaries get that benefit from the Government's move on tax. Then, the report would look at the principle of a clawback. I would have thought the Minister would accept, on grounds of fairness, that there needs to be some clawback if there is no rationale for giving away tax money to people. Would the Minister consider a clawback? Will he at least consider producing a report to see what the potential is for raising revenue from that? We would then know how many tax units we are talking about and what could be raised from the introduction of such a third rate of tax. That is the purpose of my amendment. I hope the Minister will give it serious consideration.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_739">There are three amendments in this group and all deal with the issue of the USC. I have made the point before that the leader of Fine Gael, the Tánaiste and former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, made commitments around the USC on numerous occasions that he has broken. He used to parade around the streets of Dublin with big posters saying he was going to be the leader that abolished the USC. He then made a speech at his party Ard-Fheis saying he was going to merge it with PRSI. The Minister for Finance told us recently that neither of those things are on the cards. At the time, we called the Tánaiste's announcements populist because a tax that brings in over €5 billion cannot be abolished, as he proposed, without replacing it with another source of income.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The previous speakers, Deputies Shortall and Boyd Barrett, are correct on this in terms of narrowing the tax base and all of the challenges that are there. That is what that would have done at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> I can understand why people want to hear the likes of the pronouncements made by Fine Gael in that election campaign, namely that it would get rid of over €5 billion in tax. The reality, thankfully, is that people understand that we need to fix our health system and build social, affordable and cost rental housing. People in the State are more outraged about the fact that 11,000 people are in emergency accommodation than the fact they are paying the levels of tax they are. Time and again, in terms of polling data, we see that people want investment in public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Regarding the amendments in this group, I want to focus in particular on amendment No. 70 from the Social Democrats. It is not in line with what we would have argued, but I believe its spirit is the same, namely the principle that those on a higher income should shoulder a solidarity tax. Deputy Shortall referred to the €100,000 mark. She asked why people at that income level, including Deputies, Ministers and Ministers of State, would have their tax liability reduced by €800 as a result of the budget, despite the fact that people on higher incomes have the ability to shoulder an additional burden. We need to make sure such a policy addresses some of the issues I discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Phasing out tax credits is a sensible solution. Once people reach an income of €100,000, the idea is that they should start to lose their tax credits. It was a policy introduced by the Labour Party in Britain many years ago. Even the former sister party of the Minister, the Tories, continue that policy to this day. Those on individual incomes above €140,000 have the ability to shoulder a 3% solidarity tax. I welcome that the amendment is being brought forward. I would welcome a report on the matter to be brought forward, as requested, within a period of three months of the passing of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> The amendment is not completely in line with what we in Sinn Féin have put forward for many years. However, the principle of the amendment is one with which I agree. It would begin a conversation about how and who we tax and the fairness of the system in the State. We have a progressive income tax system, but that does not mean we cannot make it more progressive. A measure like this would add to that debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">We know what happens when we narrow the tax base, and that is exactly what is happening here. If the Government is to proceed with the plans enunciated by the Tánaiste, we are getting into a very dangerous zone. We know what will happen. We have been living with the consequences of narrowing the tax base and the fiscal challenges, to put it mildly, that has imposed on the State over the past decade. We have to learn lessons from that. There is nothing fair about a budget that introduces tax cuts to the tune of €800 per person for someone who is earning a significant salary compared with somebody who would benefit to the tune of €130 or €140 if he or she is earning between €25,000 and €35,000. In nobody's language is that fair or equitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> On the question of clawback, the principle is well established regarding adjustments made to the higher rate of tax and to the taxation system more generally. I recall in budget 2015 that when the top rate of tax was reduced to 40%, a countervailing measure was argued for and introduced by the coalition which saw the rate of USC for those earning over €60,000 increased by 2% to claw back some of the benefits. That is a fair and progressive way of introducing changes to our tax code that does not disproportionately benefit those who are, objectively, better off. In no way are the tax changes made in the budget fair to those earning between €25,000 and €30,000 compared with those who are on much more handsome salaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will raise a technical matter on a point of information and I beg his indulgence. I was a little late coming into the Chamber and did not have the opportunity to raise this matter at the start of the debate. Three of my amendments were considered on Committee Stage, but have been ruled out of order. We understand if an amendment proposes a charge on the Exchequer, the clear position is that an amendment of that nature would be ruled out of order. One of the amendments, amendment No. 25, refers to relief for certain disposal of rental property to a local authority or approved housing body. That proposes a reduction in the rate of an application of a tax. My understanding is that a proposal to reduce or abolish a tax or increase exemptions to a tax are not necessarily Government prerogatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I assume the amendments have been ruled out of order based on the belief that they would impose a charge on the Exchequer. I ask for a ruling from the Chair on that. We spend a lot of time in opposition trying to develop sensible amendment. There is little point in tabling amendments if they are all routinely ruled out of order. An explanation is required for the decision on that amendment. Others I understand, if there is a clear imposition of a charge on the Exchequer. It is hard to see why my amendment was ruled out of order and I would appreciate an interpretation on that from the Chair, if the Ceann Comhairle is in a position to give one at this point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">I hope I am. My understanding is that the three amendments were ruled out of order by me on advice because the matters had not been considered on Committee Stage and did not arise out of Committee Stage proceedings. I understand from what the Deputy has said that they may have been tabled for discussion on Committee Stage, but were not reached. It is only those matters that are reached and discussed that can subsequently form the subject matter of amendments. That is long established practice in the House.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_750">With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will speak to the amendments as a group and respond to all of them. A number of amendments have been grouped together, covering a report on the abolition or replacement of USC, as submitted by Deputies from People Before Profit and the Rural Independent Group, and a report from the introduction of a 43% income tax rate on individuals earning over €100,000 as put forward by the Social Democrats. A number of significant issues arise from the proposals. For example, they include significant Exchequer costs, the erosion of our tax base and adverse impacts on the competitiveness of our tax code.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Regarding the proposal submitted by People For Profit to abolish USC, it is estimated this would cost approximately €5 billion in a full year. The suggestion to replace USC with a high income social charge of 10% on all earnings over €90,000 would yield approximately €2 billion in a full year. This would give rise to a shortfall of €3 billion in the same year. It is estimated that it would be necessary to place an additional charge of around 26% on all earnings over €90,000 in order to raise an equivalent level of revenue for the proposal to be cost neutral to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Turning to the Rural Independent Group's proposals to abolish the USC for those earning less than €70,000 and replace it with a national solidarity tax on those earning in excess of €150,000 for that year, I note the Deputies have not specified the rate of the new tax that would apply under the proposal. It is estimated by my Department that the removal of the application of USC on all incomes below €70,000, as suggested, would cost in the region of €1.84 billion in a full year.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely that if the new tax took the form of a new USC rate for those earning more than €150,000 it would need to be as high as 24% for PAYE workers and 27% for self-employed income earners in order to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure this is cost-neutral. These revenues do not take account of any behavioural changes. For example, the proposal would have the effect of increasing the top marginal tax rates from 52% and 55% to 68% and 71% for PAYE and self-employed income earners, respectively. The Social Democrats Deputies are seeking a report on the potential for the introduction of a 43% income tax rate on all individuals with incomes in excess of €100,000. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this proposal would yield approximately €365 million in the first year of its introduction and €460 million in successive years. Approximately 132,500 taxpayer units would be impacted. The introduction of a 43% income tax rate on income above €100,000 would increase the top income tax rate by three percentage points and would have the effect of increasing the top marginal rates of tax to 55% for all employees and 58% for the self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I hope Deputies recognise that high marginal tax rates are a clear disincentive to work and could also affect our international competitiveness. The considerable progress that has been made in recent years to restore our competitiveness, particularly at a time of high inflation, cannot be taken for granted. As Deputies are aware, we have a highly progressive tax code with 10% of income earners contributing approximately 60% of the total income tax and USC collected each year. To put that in context, the bottom 80% of income earners will pay 20% of income tax and USC in 2023. As I have said on many occasions, this indicates how progressive our personal income tax structure is. This has been acknowledged by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the OECD and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I note that the Rural Independent Group has also suggested raising money from companies with net profits in excess of €1.5 million per year. This could have serious consequences for the competitiveness of our corporation tax regime, with additional significant impacts for employment within our economy. To impose additional levies on corporate profits would involve increased complexity and would change the attractiveness of our corporate tax offering. I accept it is not possible to predict the effect the changes to the rate could have on the behaviour and decisions of large or multinational or domestic companies. This uncertainty makes it difficult to bring a reliable estimate of any additional yield that might accrue to the Exchequer. As the House is aware, we are part of and signed up to the OECD international tax process at the moment. I hope that the second pillar, on minimum effective tax rates, will yield an outcome soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I appreciate that the Social Democrats Deputies are seeking a report on the potential for the introduction of a 43% rate of income tax on all individuals' incomes above a certain level. However, to commission these reports could indicate an element of uncertainty in regard to the future direction of Government income tax policy. For all of those reasons, I am not in a position to accept these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">The main question I asked the Minister was a political one: what was the rationale for giving a tax break of €830 a year to people earning more than €100,000? Let us personalise that. I think it is important to do that. Everybody in this House is going to get a gift of €830 from the State due to the Minister's decision. As I have said, there are great numbers of people with incomes hugely in excess of what anybody in this House earns, including the Taoiseach. The Minister has told me that the figure is 132,000. What is his rationale for this tax break? I cannot understand what that rationale is, in light of the enormous pressure on so many people and given that it will undoubtedly make our tax system less progressive. I am sure the Minister would agree that is not a desirable objective. He has provided us with some figures. I am not sure anybody here would notice an extra 3% in tax on our incomes above €100,000. Would we seriously notice that? Would somebody earning €500,000 seriously notice an extra 3% in tax? We need to be frank about this. The Minister says there is potential for raising almost €500 million from such a measure, which would improve productivity and would be fair to everybody. It would raise almost half a billion euro for a huge number of areas that are crying out for funding, for example across disability services, health and education. The Minister has the potential to raise a significant amount of money on the grounds of fairness. He says it would lead to a lack of competitiveness. There is no evidence of which I am aware to prove that. If there is, will the Minister kindly produce it?</p>

          <p eId="para_758">I want to point out something that we do not consider very much in this House. An income of €100,000 may seem like an awful lot of money but we must also remember that anybody with an income of €80,000, €90,000 or €100,000 does not collect that. They get approximately 60% of it if they are lucky. When Deputies are thinking about these things, they must remember how it might backfire on themselves. The reality is that you do not collect it because it is already taxed. When you increase taxation and put an extra burden of taxation on top of that, all the executives who have such incomes automatically fall in for a loss. I cannot understand the reason for doing that. Is it because we dislike them? Is it because we do not want them here? Is it because they would be better off elsewhere? Maybe they should go elsewhere if we set out to penalise them in the clear knowledge that a person with €90,000 or €100,000 or any amount does not get that in their salary. They get a little more than half of it after all the deductions and tax. Maybe Independent Members or smaller party Members have a special resource that we do not know about, but that is the way it works. We all have to accept and understand that. We accept the lower amount. We do not object to it. We take it as it comes because we know that is what it amounts to. In the long run, you get roughly 60% of your income into your hand. Theoretically it is paid to you but you do not get it.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I will tell Deputy Durkan what I do not understand. All of the people in various categories who earn in excess of €100,000, such as Ministers, executives of companies, upper management in companies, bankers, consultant doctors and barristers - I am sure we could think of others - do valuable work. However, is their work more valuable than a nurse's work? </p>
          <p eId="para_760">Should their work be better remunerated than a nurse' work? Should their work be better remunerated than a teacher's work? Should their work be better remunerated than a bus driver's work? According to the World Health Organisation, the second most stressful job anyone can possibly do is to be a bus driver. They are more likely to suffer from heart attacks than bankers, although we often have this image of the stressed-out banker or chief executive who is worried sick and is likely to drop dead of a heart attack. Actually, it is far more likely for that to happen to a bus driver.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">Good point, and they should possibly pay an extra levy just for that. That is certainly the logic of our proposals to redress the balance in terms of net earnings ultimately, which is what we are trying to do through a myriad of means.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I would say in response to the Minister's direct response to our proposal that in order to cover the cost of abolishing the USC, which he promised he would get rid of and he reneged on that promise - it was an austerity tax and he promised to get rid of it - as well as introducing the higher income social charge, we are also proposing to introduce additional bands of taxation for the highest earners. That would cover the cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">In page 10, line 22, to delete “on or before 30 September 2022”.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has implemented a scheme of once-off payments to the value of €3,000 to each individual whose incorrect birth registration has been confirmed by or to Tusla. The payment is to be provided on an <i>ex gratia </i>basis without any inference or otherwise of any liability or legal obligation. It is intended as a contribution towards costs related to an incorrect birth registration such as legal fees which may be incurred in respect of seeking information on the implications of birth registration. It is not intended as redress or as a full discharge of any costs incurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> In the course of the Committee Stage debate, I indicated that the policy intention is that the <i>ex gratia</i> payments made by the Minister for Education will be free from income tax irrespective of when they are made. However, although subsection (2) of the new section 192L, to be inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act, does not contain any cut-off date, the preceding definition of qualifying individual as currently drafted does include such a restriction and refers to cases which were confirmed by the Child and Family Agency on or before 30 September 2022. I understand, following inquiries with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, that while unlikely, the possibility cannot be ruled out that further individuals might be identified after 30 September who ought to qualify for an <i>ex gratia </i>payment. The section had been originally drafted on the basis that it was most unlikely there would be further persons qualifying for this particular payment, but now, after consultation with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, this is less certain than originally thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> To be clear, this amendment removes the cut-off date in the definition of qualifying individual. This will ensure that the policy intention of section 3 of the Finance Bill is given effect, irrespective of when <i>ex gratia</i> payments are made and regardless of the date when cases are confirmed by Tusla. It will mean that if the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were to extend the terms of the scheme beyond that date, any such payments will be exempt from income tax, USC and PRSI.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">In March 2022, the Government approved the establishment by the Minister for Health of a Covid-19 death-in-service scheme for healthcare workers. Under the scheme, lump sum payments of €100,000 would be provided for health and social care workers whose deaths can be attributed to contracting the Covid-19 pandemic at work. The scheme is intended to recognise the increased risk faced during the pandemic by front-line health and social care workers and, in this spirit, the Government decision mandated that payments made under the scheme would be exempt from tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Section 74 of the Finance Bill 2022, as amended during Committee Stage, provided for an exemption from capital acquisitions tax. However, I am advised by Revenue that a further exemption in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is also necessary to ensure the payment is fully tax-free as intended. Owing to this, I am now moving this amendment, which provides for the insertion of a new section in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to exempt these <i>ex gratia</i> payments from income tax, USC and PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Entitlement to payment under the Covid-19 death-in-service scheme for healthcare workers is limited to the families of a small number of healthcare workers. According to the Department of Health, there are currently approximately 25 recipients who may qualify for the scheme. The number of payments ultimately made from the scheme is dependent on the level of future Covid-19 cases in the State, the number of deaths arising from these cases and, of those deaths, how many are related to healthcare workers who were exposed to Covid-19 by virtue of the nature and location of the work which they were contracted to carry out.</p>

It directly relates to the recognition of the service of those who worked within our public health service, on the front line, during the darkest days of the pandemic - the people who put themselves in danger. They are non-HSE staff engaged by the HSE for contracted services such as contract cleaning, security and other ancillary services in our public hospitals, and they have yet to receive the €1,000 pandemic recognition payment. It is unconscionable that they continue to wait for approval from the Department of Health for a payment for which they are eligible. I hope the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has spoken to the Minister for Health in this regard. It is an issue that was raised by several members at the committee last week. It is important that this gets resolved before Christmas. These people have waited far too long for a payment for which they are eligible.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">The purchase arm of the project is aimed at accelerating the delivery of affordable purchase homes, on site with full planning permission, that are not currently being developed by the private sector due to financing and other constraints. Under this arm, eligible purchasers will be identified by local authorities in line with the criteria outlined in the Affordable Housing Act 2021. The LDA will take beneficial ownership of each property in order to facilitate the ownership transfer from the vendor-developer directly to the eligible purchaser.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> However, the help-to-buy scheme is limited to new properties only. Although the properties being provided under Project Tosaigh will be new dwellings, the onward sale of the beneficial interest to the eligible purchaser is technically considered a second sale. For this reason, the property ceases to meet the current criteria for a qualifying residences for the purposes of the help-to-buy scheme, so the purchaser would not be eligible for help-to-buy support. For this reason, the definition of "qualifying residence" in section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is being amended to ensure that certain new homes being delivered for affordable purchase by direct sale developers, which presently include the LDA under the Project Tosaigh initiative, will continue to be considered as new homes for the purposes of the help-to-buy scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The amendment provides for such situations where a body has taken beneficial ownership of a new property for onward delivery as an affordable home and is approved to perform such activities under the Affordable Housing Act 2021. The LDA is the only body to do this. The amendment ensures that taxpayers who purchase a home under the Project Tosaigh initiative will be able to avail of help-to-buy support where all other conditions of the relief have been met.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_798">I welcome the amendment. I wish to speak generally on the area of affordable housing and the interaction with the help-to-buy scheme. The Minister's Department commissioned a report from Mazars to review the help-to-buy scheme. I have submitted a proposal that I ask be further reviewed by the Department. Under the local authority affordable housing scheme currently, there are discounts of between 15% and 40% on private houses, with the local authority taking an equity stake in the amount of the discount. However, as a result of the way it is applied, if the discount is above 22.2%, the purchaser no longer qualifies for the help-to-buy scheme because the loan-to-value ratio and the market value compared with the mortgage is below 70%. My proposal, in line with the recommendation in the report from Mazars, is that where the discount is above 20% of market value, thereafter the ratio would be based on the purchase price to the purchaser, that is, after the discount, as a percentage of the mortgage. From 20% onwards, a loan-to-value ratio of the discounted price to the purchaser would be applied. The council would retain an equity stake in the discount amount and the loan-to-value ratio would be based on the market value of the purchase price. Every time the discount goes up by 1%, the loan-to-value ratio would go up by 1%. By the time one gets to a 40% discount, there would be a loan-to-value ratio of 90%. If it is a 25% discount, it would be a loan-to-value ratio requiring 75%. If the discount goes to 30%, it would be a loan-to-value ratio of 80%. At a 35% discount, it would be 85% and at 40% it would be 90%. It is one for one. That would ensure that people qualify for the help-to-buy scheme and it would take away the dead weight. It would ensure that people who require the help-to-buy scheme get it. In the context of the original intention of the scheme, there was a loan-to-value ratio of 70%. Those who made it below that may have had a large amount of savings. Such people got the help-to-buy scheme but did not require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> This issue affects a certain category of people. The current mortgage lending limit is 3.5 times a person's salary. On 1 January, that will increase to four times a person's salary. With that, we are looking at the social income housing limits going up by €5,000 from 1 January. This means that at the top band, those with an income above €40,000 will not qualify for social housing. By my calculations, working off a limit of 3.5 times a person's earnings, a person with a salary of €46,000 will qualify for the help-to-buy scheme with a discount rate of 40%. If that limit goes to four times a person's salary, those with a salary of €40,500 will qualify. The key thing is that cohort will not qualify for social housing. I want those people to get affordable housing. A good example would be to take a house with a price of €300,000. A discount of 40%, or €120,000, would mean the price to the purchaser would be €180,000. The purchaser would get €18,000 from the help-to-buy scheme, and have a mortgage of €162,000. Using 3.5 times annual salary, that would put the person on a salary of €46,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> I want people to be able to purchase their own homes. I have done this as best I can. I know the Department has considered it. I am asking for a review. I want people to be able to purchase their own homes if at all possible. If the State needs to take an equity stake, so be it. The problem is that if the discount rate is above 20%, the person will not qualify for the help-to-buy scheme. I am looking for an increasing loan-to-value ratio based on the purchase price to the mortgage. It is getting rid of the dead weight. If I have a mortgage of 75%, that means I have 25%. The help-to-buy scheme will get me a maximum of approximately 10% of the value, or €22,500, and I provide the balance in savings. I do not need that high discount. If I am on a salary of €46,000, however, I require it. The State still retains an equity stake. Is it not better to have the State take an equity stake of 40% rather than having those people being required eventually to go on the social housing list and the State having to invest 100% of the cost of the house? I am a proponent of house purchase. I want people to be able to afford their own homes. I want the State to assist them. There is no risk to the State here. There is a cost in the help-to-buy scheme and I accept that, but it is a small price to pay. These people will not have to avail of HAP. They will be able to pay their own mortgage. I am asking for an overall review of the help-to-buy scheme and its interaction with the local authority affordable housing scheme. I feel very strongly about this. I want us to have a model. We are seeking to cater for all categories. People whose income is below €40,000 can avail of social housing. Those whose incomes are higher can go for private housing and mortgages. There is a cohort in between. I am worried there is a lacuna whereby a cohort earning between €40,000 and €45,000 or €50,000 cannot get on the property ladder. We should assist them, with the State taking a stake with the discount. I have already made an initial submission. All I am asking is that the Department carry out a detailed review on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_801">I do not think Deputy O'Donnell has tabled an amendment relating to his proposal, but I hear what he is saying with regard to targeting support for those trying to get on the property ladder and having a detailed review of the matter. I again put it to the Minister that he has carried out a detailed review in this regard. The review has shown there is substantial dead weight in the help-to-buy scheme. Was it 52% of individuals who benefited from the help-to-buy scheme who did not need its support to get onto the property ladder? That is different from what Deputy O'Donnell is talking about, which is people who genuinely cannot afford to purchase a house. The cost of the dead weight is more than €100 million. In the mouth of a housing crisis, it is not the right use of State resources, particularly when there is evidence that this is pushing up house prices. </p>
          <p eId="para_802">We continually hear about how the help-to-buy scheme has benefited X number of individuals but what the Government does not say is that more than half of those individuals did not need that scheme to purchase their home. They had a deposit in excess of what the macroprudential rules lay down for their category.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> There is a serious issue here. The report requested that the Minister look at the loan-to-value ratio; he has not done so. The report also requested other changes. There is a real issue here, as I said on Committee Stage, in that he and his party has driven policy on housing that has been an almighty disaster for people the length and breadth of this State. On Committee Stage, I told him that this was not just an issue anymore of people trying to afford to purchase their own home, or whether they could keep a roof over their heads when they were renting from their landlord. This crisis, catastrophe, disaster and emergency has now spread right across different facets. Since Committee Stage, we have heard six different teachers' unions come out very clearly on the Government's policy and the fact that it is now affecting the education sector being able to attract teachers. We also hear that in respect of the health sector. It is not just those areas but others as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> It is clear that Fine Gael lives in some type of deluded bubble, when we hear the Tánaiste talk about the grass not always being greener on the other side and things are just as bad in other areas as they are here. I urge Fine Gael, as a party that is now in its twelfth year of government, as one of the architects of this crisis and as a party that has pursued policies, even if it did not know about it at the time and forgetting that the Opposition told the party this would have the consequences it would, to acknowledge the evidence is now clear. There is nowhere whatsoever to hide. Fine Gael's policies have collectively pushed up house prices to the highest level they have ever been in the history of the State. Its policies collectively over the past 12 years have resulted in a social nightmare, where 11,000 people are in emergency accommodation and where this Friday, my children and children throughout the State will look forward to "The Late Late Toy Show", but others will be in hotel rooms and emergency accommodation wondering how Santa Claus will visit them this year, maybe not for the first time in emergency accommodation. Others will enter that system because of the policies of Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Rents went up 20%, which is crazy stuff, and 19% in County Donegal in the past year, yet, if we listen to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, they swear they are doing a good job. If the intention is to create the largest number of homeless people, the largest house prices, the largest rent increases, or the largest rents we have ever seen then, fair play boys, the Government has nailed it out of the park, but that is not we should be doing. The help-to-buy scheme is a measure that is being brought in because of the desperation of so many people who cannot afford a house. Anybody who cannot afford a house and is offered €30,000 in State money will, of course, grab it with both hands. Why would they not? That money means there is possibly a light at the end of the tunnel for them but the problem is it drives up house prices. When the amount is increased, a finite number of houses are being chased at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> We see that is the case with this scheme, in addition to the advice from numerous other individuals, including Secretaries General and external organisations funded by the State, which are telling the Government that some of its schemes are pushing up house prices, the shared equity scheme being another of them. That is the consequence of it and the Government cannot hide from that. It cannot hide from that anymore. That is why I have a serious issue with the fact that the Government is not dealing properly and sufficiently with the source of the problem. Indeed, by trying to remedy this and to recognise that so many people are locked out of homeownership, which has fallen under Fine Gael, and by introducing this scheme, which is so short term, the Government is having an impact on affordability across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> What we needed to do for many years, and what we still need to do, is to aim for far more ambitious targets on social, affordable and cost-rental housing. We need to cut the red tape for the delivery of housing, from the Department right through to all the different steps that are in place. I can bring the Minister to within 10 km of my home in west Donegal where one of the biggest issues I now face and deal with as an elected representative, which I never ever dreamed of living in a rural constituency, is so many people who face homelessness. I never thought in my life that would happen nor did the people who come to me. They thought it was an issue that affected people in the inner cities of Dublin and maybe Cork, not rural west Donegal, the heart of the Gaeltacht or elsewhere. It is now the reality for many families, most of whom hold down full-time jobs. The reality is we have to get to grips with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> We need to drive forward - I am sure the Government will say it is doing this - the delivery of social, affordable and cost-rental houses to deal with the housing crisis. The Government cannot hide from the fact we have the highest house prices, highest rents and, shamefully, the highest number of homeless people in the history of the State. We see all the other indicators. The Minister appeared before us at the finance committee to tell us that commencements were going in the right direction. This is the deluded bubble Fine Gael lives in where it swallows its own spin and propaganda. Commencements have been falling for the past seven months. Over a 12-month period, commencements are down by approximately 8,000 compared to where they were seven months ago. There is a serious issue with the pipeline. The Government needs to wake up to the reality because so many people and families are suffering as a result of the disastrous policies it has introduced year after year in these type of finance Bills. Members of the Government stand there, think they know all the answers and all the rest, refuse to listen to the Opposition and, as a result, they have created a situation in this country that was completely and utterly avoidable. Now is the time to do the right thing.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_266" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_809">I will respond to the proposal made by Deputy O'Donnell. As he will be aware, the Department has conducted a thorough review of the help-to-buy scheme. I appreciate the further point he raised. My officials and I received the paper he submitted and we will, of course, give it consideration. He knows the issue we grapple with, however, in that I accept there is an issue with the so-called deadweight effect of the help-to-buy scheme. A key factor driving that is the level of the loan-to-value ratio. If there is a change in that ratio for some people who are participating in the scheme, I certainly find it difficult to see how that would not lead to further changes in the help-to-buy ratio over time, raising further questions regarding the impact the scheme is having on helping those people buy their first home. That being said, the Deputy raised an important matter. We received his paper and we will give it consideration and thought but I want to be open with him regarding a key difficulty there.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> On the assertions made by Deputy Doherty, I will be clear that while the Mazars report contained many points that were critical of the help-to-buy scheme, it also stated, "There is not definitive evidence that HtB [help to buy] pushed up the price of new houses." That was the conclusion of that report on houses. I will not make the case for a second that our housing policies are yet making the necessary progress for those worried about being homeless or not being able to afford their rent. Were I to do so, I would indeed be in the kind of bubble the Deputy referred to but because I am not, I will simply say that the policies we have in place are leading to more homes being built. Our objective is to increase supply, not increase pricing. We remain clear on the impact the lack of homes is having on too many and are ever determined to strengthen and review our policies to make a difference in the time ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_811">I thank the Minister for taking my paper on this particular issue. I look forward to further engagement with him and his Department on the points I raised. The scheme is designed on a loan-to-value ratio of 70%. The scheme has been a success but no scheme will ever be perfect. If it went below a loan-to-value ratio of 70%, it would raise questions in terms of the possibility of deadweight.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> My proposal is straightforward. I want people to be able to purchase their own homes. There is a cohort that will not qualify for social housing even with the new income limits. The highest limit, which is band one, will go from €35,000 to €40,000. Somebody in the cohort above that income range gets a 40% discount under the local authority affordable housing scheme where the income limit is 3.5 times a person's earnings. If the person has an income of €46,000, he or she can purchase his or her own home under the help-to-buy scheme with the council retaining a 40% stake. If it goes to four times earnings on an income of €40,500, the person will qualify to purchase his or her own home with the State retaining 40% equity. In that case, with a €300,000 home, which is the example Mazars used, the person gets €18,000 under the help-to-buy scheme. Overall, this is good value for money. I am supportive of the scheme. I look forward to further engagement with the Minister and his officials and I thank him for his open engagement on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_813">The Minister can say he is conscious of the deadweight - the €100 million that has gone to people who do not need this support to purchase their own homes - but he has done nothing about it. This is the Finance Bill and he has done nothing about it. Mazars made it clear that this is poorly designed in respect of affordability, house prices and its objectives, yet the Minister comes forward with a Bill to extend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> He said the Government's objective is to reduce house prices. By God, it has fairly failed on that one. Can he cite one year during his tenure as Minister for Finance when prices went down? Can he cite any one year from 2016 onwards when prices went down? On his watch, prices have gone up and up. What he plans to do in this Bill is to push them up further. Is that not right? He will push them up because he is going to introduce a concrete levy, which, according to his own officials and the SEAI, will add at least €1,200 to the cost of a three-bed semi-detached house. At a time when everybody knows, or should know, that we need to drive down the cost of housing, the bright sparks in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have said: "You know what we'll do? We'll introduce a measure that will actually put up the price of housing." I put it to the Minister that the Bill will increase the price of housing. There is no way to hide from that one either. It is as simple as that. The figure will be at least €1,200. Others have said it will be far more because it has not factored in inflation before the end of the year and other factors.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_269" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_815">In my earlier contribution, I said my objective was to increase supply. The record of the Dáil will show whether or not I gave a commitment here this evening to reduce prices. I do not believe I did. What I said was that the aim of Government policy is to increase supply. I believe that increasing supply over time will lead to a reduction in the price pressure that is there and is having such an effect on tenants and people looking to buy their first home. The objective of the Government is first and foremost to increase supply, which over time will lead to an improvement in affordability.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I have long considered and have in the run up to each finance Bill looked at whether alternatives to the help-to-buy scheme are possible and if they would be any better. This scheme has a number of features that are really important. The first one is that it relates the availability of this incentive directly to the fact that the home must be newly built. It is a key feature of this scheme versus many other schemes that are available. </p>
          <p eId="para_817"> Second, it also offers support to self-builds. Offering support to self-builds is a factor in why the loan-to-value ratio is at its current level. I believe it is very appropriate that the tax code has a scheme that offers support to people in buying their first home. This year alone, 7,600 people were able to access help-to-buy scheme and because of this, they were able to buy their first home. These are people who do not qualify for social housing, the shared equity scheme and local authority schemes. I believe that even for those taxpayers, support for buying their first home, which is newly built, is the right thing to do. This is a key point of difference between me and Deputy Doherty. I do not know what he would say to all of these people were he to cancel this scheme. He might get the opportunity to make that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">I move amendment No. 7:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_820">In page 15, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_821">
            <b>“Renters Tax Credit</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_822"><b>12.</b> Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil on whether a regime of rent controls would be a more effective way to support renters than a renters tax credit.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">To move things along, I did not intervene in the previous discussion but, in a way, we are covering similar territory here. In this amendment, we suggest that rather than introducing a renter's tax credit of €500, the Minister would look at whether it would be more effective to deal with the crisis of unaffordable rents by examining a serious system of rent controls that seek to make rents affordable. It is self-evident that a €500 tax credit, which only some renters will be able to get, is just piddling. It is a fairly pathetic drop in the ocean compared to the situation renters face. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> In the past year, rents in Dublin have gone from an average of €2,000 per month to €2,200 per month. That is an increase of €200 per month or €2,400 per year. In my area of Dún Laoghaire, average rents last year were €2,200. They are now €2,400 and rising. Against that background, to offer people a €500 tax credit is worse than a joke because those rents are utterly unsustainable. On average, €24,000 in after-tax income was required last year to pay the average rent and the figure is now up to €26,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">This is just insanity. It is not sustainable. The €500 tax credit just goes straight into the pockets of landlords and does not leave renters in any better position whatsoever. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> As I did on Committee Stage, I wish to humanise this issue. I had several people in here today for Leaders' Questions from Tathony House, Rathmines Road and St. Helen's Court, all of whom are facing mass evictions from multi-unit complexes at the hands of landlords. There were also individuals facing eviction. All of them are in this dire situation. All of them are working families, people with jobs, but they just cannot afford this. They are in a hopeless situation because they are being evicted on the grounds of sale, which the Minister allows. They cannot afford these rents. I am talking here about people who have reasonable jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I will give one example, that of a couple, Jacqueline and her husband. He works for the ESB. They are being evicted from the house they have lived in for 55 years by the landlord on grounds of sale. She, her husband and her two children are absolutely terrified because there is nothing for them. Their earnings are just enough to place them above the income threshold in this regard, and even the new increased income thresholds, I think. Given their age, they went to the bank and asked if there was any chance they could borrow and get a mortgage to buy their house, now it was for sale. There was no chance. Jacqueline and her husband are in their mid-to-late 50s, so the bank would only give them a mortgage for seven years. Purchasing the house, therefore, was not a runner. Equally, they could not possibly afford to pay €1,200 or €1300 a month in rent. What are they to do? Seriously. Jacqueline was crying in the Gallery today. She was crying at the protest, along with her daughters. They are terrified. What are they to do? If the Minister can give me an answer, I will be happy. I will be happy if I can give an answer to Jacqueline, and to the other families, as to what they are to do to avoid ending up - and this is the vision Jacqueline has - of sitting in a car, along with the family, on the side of the road at Christmas because there is nowhere to go. Jacqueline is not even entitled to emergency accommodation if she is made homeless because her income is above the threshold. What do we do?</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> One thing we could do would be to reduce rents and bring them down to affordable levels. What was the point in having, even if the supply of housing is increased, as the Minister often says, places being rented out at these prices? All the housing being built now is going to be rented out at these rents. What is the point of building stuff like this? Who can afford it? Nobody can. The only people who will be able to afford this housing, to buy it, will be the vulture and investment funds that will come in and charge these levels of rent. These are the only parties who can afford to buy the places being built, or very rich people.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I am, therefore, genuinely asking the Minister, if he does not agree with or think our solution is viable, which is to bring in rent controls and ensure nobody has to pay more than 25% of their income in rent, to please tell me what people in a situation like the one I described are supposed to do. There are no answers to this question now. There is not even the prospect of there being answers being offered by the Government to these sorts of dilemmas. If I am missing something, then I ask the Minister to let me know what it is and I will relay this information to the people terrified they are going to be on the street because they cannot afford these rents.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">The inclusion of tax credits for renters in the budget was hailed by the Government and sections of the media as a big step forward for renters. At the same time as this tax credit is being introduced, though, is there any move being made to further curb rents? Is there going to be a rent freeze? No, there is not. It will not happen in every circumstance, but in a large number of cases, and the Minister and I know this, landlords will see renters coming, see the tax credit coming and see this as an opportunity to hike rent levels. The money at stake in the context of the tax credit, therefore, will not end up in the pockets of renters but in those of the landlords. This is what is going to happen in many cases. In fact, this is indicative of the general approach of the Government and the general effect of the budgetary measures, and not only in the context of renting, which is the subject we are discussing. There has been €4.1 billion in once-off spending by the Government in the context of this budget package. Where, though, are the measures that have been taken to end, cut across or even seriously challenge the profiteering that ordinary people see going on all around them? I am talking about what happens in the supermarkets, forecourts, garages, etc. Where are the anti-profiteering measures?</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I believe the Government was forced to make concessions and that it went further in the budget than it had originally intended by way of concessions for several reasons. The key reason was the general mood in the country, which Government Deputies and Ministers were not unaware of. This led them to realise that they would be in trouble if they did not go further than intended. I also believe the protests that took place in Cork on 17 September and in Dublin on 24 September were a factor in the Government's thinking. It is not that the Government saw 20,000 people on the streets and was terrified by this, but it was sufficiently politically savvy enough to know that if it did not go further originally intended with budget measures, these protests would have had the potential to grow to 40,000, 60,000 and 80,000 people, and it did not want this. It remembered the experience of the water charges. These protests, and those who organised them, then can claim some degree of credit for forcing the Government to go further than it had intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> To bring this matter back to the question of the tax credits for rent, but also the other concessions made, we can see how what was trumpeted as something that would put money into people's pockets has ended up boosting the profits of supermarkets, big energy companies and the income of landlords in this case. I am for real rent controls, but if what the Government is doing is introducing a tax credit for renters, then the least the Government can do is to introduce it for the lowest-paid workers as well. The budget excludes them because the tax credit for tenants in private rental accommodation does not apply to those whose incomes are sufficiently low that they are not subject to income tax. The Government will respond that those who do not pay income tax cannot get a tax credit. The idea of a tax credit, however, according to the Government's messaging was to give renters a break. If renters are being given a break, then it should and must also apply to the lowest-paid workers who do not pay sufficient income tax to avail of the tax credit in the context of the rules the Government has laid down. That is the gist of this amendment. I am not happy with the proposal as it stands. We are for real rent controls, and if we do not have real rent controls, then the tax credit is like a leaky bucket.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">If the Minister is to do it that way, the least he can do is include the lowest paid workers in the scheme, and that is in the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_834">I will speak to my party's amendment No. 11. It was not today or yesterday that I started to raise with the Minister the need to introduce a rent credit. Time and again, he has taken the position of telling us a rent credit would go into the pocket of landlords. Those words were echoed by his party leader and the Taoiseach. Year after year, the Minister said a rent credit would make the situation worse, there would be less housing and it would be a State subsidy to landlords. Obviously, he was only responding to one part of our suggestion, that of a tax relief for renters. That had to be accompanied, however, by a three-year rent freeze. In fairness, at least the Minister's officials have been consistent because they advise him time and again that the likely outcome of this will be higher rents for the exact reason Deputy Barry outlined, namely, that there is nothing in large swathes of the State to prevent landlords from increasing rents accordingly. That is a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> I welcome that the Minister has got halfway there and has seen the light and done a U-turn. I welcome that he has agreed with at least half of what we are saying in terms of a rent credit. It is now time to go the whole hog and introduce a rent freeze across the State. It is such a pity the Minister did not do this three years ago when we asked him to do it. Can he imagine the impact for renters if he had listened to what we were saying on our amendments to the Finance Bill three years ago? At that time, the average rent in Donegal was €658 per month. It is now €933. Renters are paying over €3,000 more as a result of the failure of the Minister to introduce a rent freeze. Rents in Donegal are among the lowest in the State. They are no longer at the levels we thought. However, the county also has a low level of disposable income. In other areas rents are far higher and this has become the straw that broke the camel's back. The Minister's refusal to act has caused rents to increase year after year at record levels. As a result of his inaction on this matter, rents have placed an additional burden of thousands of euro on renters.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> It is not only that prices have gone up. Under the stewardship of the Minister and his Government, we now see that there were only 495 rental units on the market as of 1 July compared with 1,500 at any time between 2014 and 2019. That is the extent of the rental collapse under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I am sure the Minister will find some imaginative way to try to spin this that it is all Sinn Féin's fault but we will wait to see what he has to say on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> The recent comment by the Tánaiste, when referring to young people considering emigrating due to the burden and stress of renting in this State, that the grass is always greener but young people will not find lower rents if they emigrate shows how out of touch the Minister's party is. The Tánaiste was inundated with messages from people who left these shores and are in different places, for example, in European cities such as Brussels and Berlin, where rents are not only cheaper but accommodation is more spacious and secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> The Minister has spent years opposing and arguing against Sinn Féin's calls for rent relief in the form of a refundable tax relief of one month's rent to be put back into renters' pockets. We proposed a rate of 8.3% capped at €1,500. When I read the reply to a freedom of information request I put in on the advice the officials were giving the Minister on the renter's credit he is bringing forward, I was interested in one of the comments in the papers - that it is understood the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is seeking a rental tax credit of 8.5% on annual rental costs capped at €1,500 at an estimated cost of €273 million. That is actually the Sinn Féin proposal. Then again, maybe it should not be surprising to me because this is a Minister who is completely out of ideas and who has overseen, on behalf of the Government, a crisis that is out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> What needs to happen is that the rent credit should be increased and should be refundable. Crucially, it should not go into the pockets of landlords, which is why the Minister needs to introduce a three-year rent freeze. I have put this question to him time and again but he will not answer it. If I asked the Minister three years ago what, in his view, would be a success in terms of rent prices, would success have been when someone could rent a house in Donegal for €650? Rents in Donegal are now nearly €1,000. Average rents have gone up by €300 right across the board. Even those who were paying €2,000 are now paying €2,300 per month. That is €3,600 extra that a family has to find every year to pay the landlord. That is before-tax income of over €6,500 that they have to find. What is the measure? How far will the Minister allow rents to go before he recognises that, as he is being advised by his officials, the likely impact of this measure he is introducing is an increase in rents? This is the issue, as it is with the help-to-buy scheme. Mazars, and the Minister is correct on this point, did not say the help-to-buy scheme pushed up house prices. What Mazars said is "it facilitated higher prices". That is what the independent report says.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> People who are desperate will obviously welcome a renter's tax credit, but what will that mean when the landlord keeps on pushing up prices? In Donegal, rents went up by 19% last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">What I am looking to do here, conscious of the big challenge and need that so many face at present, is to build more homes and make more rental accommodation available. I appreciate that it is taking time and it will take time for these measures to be felt and to have the effect I want to see. While I accept the evidence is not fast enough for many, we are seeing more and more new homes being built. There were 27,417 new homes commenced up to September. A total of 44,715 homes have planning permission. This is an increase of more than 11% in the number of homes in the same time a year ago. We have seen the number of apartments completed increase by 153%. We have seen more and more social housing being delivered. Of course this is enabled by the €4.5 billion that has been made available by the Government to our local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deliver more and more homes. Until August of this year, we saw 16,123 homes purchased by first-time buyers. That is one third of all homes purchased.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> I acknowledge, as I make the case about these figures and about more homes being built, that even more homes need to be delivered and that for so many the progress we are delivering is not enough. I acknowledge all of this. I am aware of the human cases Deputies Boyd Barrett and Doherty referred to. I meet these people too. Since the budget was announced, and since the measures in it became clear and have been explained in the Finance Bill, I have met people for whom the rental tax credit will have a positive effect. It will help in the payment of their rent for this year and next year. Of course they tell me they want it to be more and they want the rent tax credit to be increased further. The point I am making is that the measure we are introducing will help and will make a difference. It will help at a time when rents are increasing. The best response to rents increasing is to introduce measures such as the rent credit, which we are making available, and make available more rental accommodation as quickly as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> Deputy Doherty made reference to the official advice I receive which pointed to some of the risks and trade-offs with regard to introducing a rental tax credit. He did not make reference to the advice I also received and the documents made available to me that point out the rent freeze he is advocating would have a negative effect on the supply of new rental accommodation. Deputy Doherty will say that in the face of advice such as this, it is up to people to reach their own view on what they think the appropriate policy would be. As Minister, I have the same right to weigh up the various advice put to me and reach a view on what I think is the appropriate course of action. However, if we look at the impact that rent freezes have had in other jurisdictions and other large cities, it points to the fact that over time they do not lead to more rental accommodation being made available. While a rent freeze benefits those who are in properties affected by the rent freeze, the evidence from Berlin, where the measure is no longer in place, and from San Francisco is that there has been a sharp drop in the availability of rental accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">Whether it is San Francisco or Berlin, or even in the debate taking place regarding the implementation of a rent freeze in Scotland, the warnings are clear. Of course it delivers a benefit to those in rental accommodation who need support but it will deter the supply of more rental accommodation in future. This is why, even though I can understand its attraction, such a measure would lead to less rental accommodation being available. By doing this, in turn it will lead to higher rents. We have measures in the rental pressure zones that cap the annual increase in rental levels at 2% per annum and 75% of rental properties throughout the State are now in rent pressure zones. For these reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_871">Not surprisingly, the Minister is not able to answer the question as to what I say to Jacqueline, Richard and their two children who are facing homelessness because they are being evicted by their landlord on the grounds of sale, which the Government allows. In the middle of a housing emergency, which the Minister does not want to acknowledge, he is allowing evictions. What do I say to them? Where do they go? They cannot afford average rents of €2,400 per month. They would be lucky to find somewhere at that cost in Dún Laoghaire. This amounts to €28,000 a year just for rent before paying for anything else and after tax. This is what people need to find somewhere. Where do they go?</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I have cited only this case but it is true of the 35 families in Tathony House and the 25 families affected in Rathmines. It is also true of Stella who was in with us today and several thousand more people. The Government acknowledged that deferment of notice to quit, which, by the way, does not help Jacqueline because she had received the notice to quit prior to its introduction and could potentially be evicted before Christmas, means evictions will come in a flood afterwards. Families will have nowhere to go. We will then pay €200 million to accommodate them in substandard emergency accommodation. The State will pay for this anyway except the people, children and families affected will have to go through the misery, trauma, hardship and hurt of going into emergency accommodation or being on the side of the street. Eventually we will have to give them an answer but at present the Government is saying it does not have an answer. Give us an answer. Our answer is to control the rents and stop the evictions now. Even if the Minister will not do it, in the long term he should intervene to stop people being made homeless by making rents affordable and stopping people being evicted.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">Whatever the Minister's motivation, whether by design on accident, I would like to know how high rents will go before the penny drops with him that his policies are contributing to the housing crisis and the rental crisis. That is the point. Whatever about whether it was an accident or motivated, and I do not suggest it was motivated, the evidence of the Minister's time in Government is that it has been an unmitigated disaster. There is no way he can hide from it. When he went into Government in 2016 rents were €1,000. They have increased by approximately 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The Minister spoke about Berlin and I am glad that in the past week he has recognised that Berlin no longer has a rent freeze. He spoke about the lack of supply. Here the reduction in supply of rental properties over the past year is 63% according to Threshold and the Citizens Information Board. The point we keep making to the Minister is that the Government's targets on social and affordable housing and cost rental housing are far too low. Of course the Minister can ignore advice. That is not a problem. I am making the point, because I agree with the advice, that in areas where there is no rent freeze a rent credit will go into the pocket of landlords. This is what will happen. It will increase rents. This is why we need a rent freeze. It is why we need the Government to substantially invest in social, affordable and cost rental homes over the three-year period. I genuinely ask because the Minister has been in office for half a decade. Under his stewardship this has gone absolutely crazy. No wonder so many people are giving up hope. It is not fair and it is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">On the policies the Minister introduces in the Finance Bill, nobody looks at what happens here, but it is here that the damage is done. It is in budgets and finance Bills that the damage is done, the foundations are laid and the course is set for a housing crisis and a housing disaster. Despite all the indicators saying "disaster", the Minister keeps going down this road and is unwilling to change tack, and that is a serious problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">The Government and I have shown the commitment we have to make a difference to the huge challenges many are facing by increasing the funding in our capital building programmes for local authorities all over the country to build more social and affordable houses and by our efforts to support the private sector to deliver more homes. I refer to the role and impact of the help to buy scheme, which the Opposition is against. I refer to the shared equity scheme, which the Opposition is against. I refer to the Land Development Agency, which is looking to deliver more land banks and deliver more homes, that the Opposition is against. Many different housing schemes and projects have been brought forward by local authorities the length and breadth of the country, which the Opposition voted against and opposed locally, while Members come into the Dáil and look for more homes to be built. That is what we have sought to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Of course, we acknowledge more progress needs to be made and that we have to deliver more homes. However, what I will not do is indicate I am prepared to bring in measures, as the Opposition is suggesting, that have the capacity to make a tough situation even harder and tougher for so many. I repeat what I said earlier in the debate. Bringing in a measure that seeks to freeze rents at their current level for a three-year period, while I can understand its appeal in the face of the huge difficultly and significant angst and worry so many people face, is a recipe for less rental accommodation being made available and higher rents. The evidence is clear from other cities and countries that have brought in such measures. As difficult as our situation is, the answer is more supply being built in the ways the Government is seeking to deliver, and we know we must deliver that.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> In conclusion, I refer to the very human situation Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to earlier. He brought up this on Committee Stage and I gave him the best answer I could then, which I will make available to the Dáil. I have those conversations in my constituency and face families who are affected in the way the Deputy described. We give all the support we can to provide, in my case, Dublin City Council, and, in the Deputy's case, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council, supports to families who are in those circumstances. Their plight is the reason the Government wants to make a difference to a situation we accept is difficult for so many.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">On the grouping of amendments, it is my understanding that as we are discussing amendment No. 7, Deputy Boyd Barrett has the right to come back in for a third time. Other speakers have had their opportunity and the offer is to Deputy Boyd Barrett alone. That is the guidance I have received.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">That is correct. It is just not good enough for the people. Believe me, we are engaging with the local authority. Sometimes that helps us get solutions, but more often than not, it does not. So many people are falling through the cracks and that number is growing all the time. It is just not good enough. I am not going to describe motives or anything else, but I do think there is politics involved. The Government is labouring under the illusion that at some point, if the supply of public and private houses reaches a certain level, rents or house prices will go down. That is not going to happen unless there is a crash. That is the only way that will happen. Does the Minister honestly believe the private sector will let prices go down? It will stop building before it does that. The private sector will not let rents or house prices go down. If the Government is labouring under that illusion, it is a mistaken illusion that will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> The public sector has to ramp up, on a massive scale, the direct provision of public and social housing. By the way, I supported all those projects and never opposed one of them. What I do oppose is the wasting of human labour building properties that no one can afford. We were 100% behind the Cherrywood development, which could have solved the entire south Dublin housing problem. We tried to fight for more social and affordable housing. The problem is, even though that one development could solve the entire south Dublin housing crisis, it will not because all of it will be unaffordable. We were campaigning for 15 years for the development in Shanganagh, where we only got the sod turned this week. Meanwhile, there are fellas building co-living apartments for rent at €1,300 a month, in which you would not put a dog. They were built and that is the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_890">We will come to amendment No. 11, which calls on the rent freeze, after we deal with amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> Let me make this point to the Minister and perhaps his colleague will come to the Chamber and assist him in his response. He made the point about people objecting to social housing. What we want is social and affordable housing built on public lands. Perhaps the Minister could comment on the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ. Is he familiar with that development? It had the potential to provide 8,000 to 11,000 homes, 30% social and affordable housing, in Clondalkin. Who opposed it? Fine Gael did. The Minister's colleague, Deputy Emer Higgins, was group leader at the time. Thankfully, the council voted for it, but Fine Gael did not let it rest there. What did it do? It appealed the decision, for 11,000 homes, to An Bord Pleanála. That is the reality and there are countless examples of that not just in Dublin city but across the board. There are also countless examples of sweetheart deals, as Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, where houses are going to be built on public land and will be unaffordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> The amendment deals with the issue of foreign earnings deduction, FED, and their qualifying criteria. Foreign earnings deduction provides a relief from income tax, of up to €35,000, from a salary of an employee who is tax resident in Ireland and travels out of the State, temporarily, to carry out duties to support firms that endeavour to expand their exports into new markets. It is a measure I support. The employee must spend a minimum of 30 days abroad in a year, with each trip consisting of at least three consecutive days in a qualifying period. The cost of this measure has increased from €800,000 to €5.4 million. One could argue that the increase of the cost is a success because the aim is to support businesses in terms of export markets, and never has that been more important in the aftermath of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> The issue is that there is no stipulation in respect of the type of activity an employee does to avail of the deduction. For example, an employee could be abroad for 30 days a year, in a qualifying country, but he or she may be carrying out work that could be done at home. Given the cost to the Exchequer, it is important that the activities performed by the FED assignment are export-orientated activities that cannot be undertaken within the State. I say that without suggesting in any way that this is being manipulated or abused. It is our job to look at the criteria and foresee some of these issues. We have all seen how remote and online working have changed how we carry out our activities in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">It is important that the qualifying criteria be reviewed to ensure the policy objective is achieved.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_306" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_895">A deduction, as has just been described, provides relief from income tax on up to €35,000 for employees who are tax resident in Ireland but travel out of the State to temporarily carry out duties of their office or employment in certain qualifying countries. In this way, it acts as incentive to Irish businesses seeking to develop and expand into emerging markets in any of the 30 qualifying countries. In order to qualify for this deduction, an employee must spend a minimum of 30 days abroad in a continuous 12-month period and each trip must consist of at least three consecutive days substantially devoted to the performance of duties in a qualifying country.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The incentive had a cost of approximately €5 million in 2019, the most recent year for which Revenue data are available. The scheme was last examined in 2019 when an independent review recommended an extension to the end of 2024. The review stated that the policy objective of assisting firms in Ireland to diversify their exports remained valid. Given the impact of Brexit, the impact of which is still being felt and may grow in the future, the review found that this measure was even more relevant to Ireland than it had been when the scheme was first introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> With regard to the qualifying criteria referenced in the Deputy's amendment, it should be noted that section 823(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for state aid reasons does not specify particular activities to be performed to avail of the relief. Sector-specific reliefs, as a general rule, are subject to more onerous state aid requirements. It should also be noted that Revenue statistics on the measure are published on its website annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> As the extension is due to come to an end at the end of 2024, decisions on the scheme will no doubt be considered in the coming 12 to 18 months. I expect that this will lead to a further review of and inquiry into the scheme. For that reason, the amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty this evening is not needed or merited in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1040">I move amendment No. 12:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1041">In page 65, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1042">
            <b>“Report on mortgage interest relief</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1043"><b>24.</b> The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the introduction of targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief in respect of primary dwelling homes, considering options for its design, in the context of sudden and significant increases in interest payable on mortgage loans.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">This amendment calls for a report to be laid before Dáil Éireann on the introduction of targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief in respect of primary dwelling homes, considering options for its design, in the context of sudden and significant increases in interest payable on mortgage loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, on 14 September the ECB increased its interest rate by 75 basis points, which is three quarters of a percentage point, to bring it up to 2%. This was the third interest rate hike since July and unfortunately others are expected in the coming months. Some of this has had an immediate impact on mortgage holders, especially those with tracker mortgages. Those who have had their mortgages sold on to vulture funds and other non-retail banks have seen this passed on immediately. Others have increased the fixed rate and may still increase the variable rate. We know 54% of outstanding mortgage balances are on variable mortgages, and as the Central Bank says, they will likely see an immediate increase in mortgage interest costs when rates rise. It also notes that even for fixed-rate mortgages, fixation periods are relatively short, meaning borrowings would be refinanced at higher rates after a relatively short period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> I would like to consider those who have had this impact passed onto them, including all of the people on trackers and all of those who had their loans sold to vultures and so on. Even though countless Ministers for Finance have told us it does not matter who holds a person's loan, it does matter today. People have seen their loans sold from AIB to a vulture. AIB has so far absorbed the variable rate and so has Bank of Ireland. Vultures have not. They have passed on these rate increases. This means if a person has a €200,000 loan, they will see their repayments increase next year by €2,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> Many Deputies in this Chamber and on the Government benches are landlords. I note that landlords are able to offset mortgage interest against their tax so there is 100% relief for landlords. That does not exist for somebody who has their primary dwelling, is paying a mortgage and is now seeing their interest rate increase by 2%, which is an annual increase of about €2,000. They do not have anywhere to go. They used to, as we had mortgage interest relief up until 2021. The Government should take a pragmatic and reasoned approach, which is something it has not done so far, and get the Department to consider and publish options for the design and introduction of a relief. We in Sinn Féin are working with the Parliamentary Budget Office on costing models of this but it is something the Department should do. We have been clear that the banks should be absorbing the interest rate hikes in the interests of their customers. Obviously, that is not the case with trackers as they are pinned to the ECB rate but with variable rate mortgages I encourage the banks to continue to absorb the interest rate hikes in the interests of their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> This is about trying to ensure people are not fully insulated because we are not talking about that. The design I have in mind is looking at the proportion of increase that has happened. It would not look at all the interest that is paid but at the proportion that has increased over the past year. I suggest that a portion of that would supported by the State, similar to the energy credit, for example, where you can have an upper limit for what can be availed of by an individual or a householder. This is a reasonable approach. I suggest to the Minister, despite the fact his Government has stood against this idea, that it is time to do something for hard-pressed homeowners who have seen a shock 2% increase in the cost of the mortgages on their homes. When the bills must be paid, it does not matter to an individual whether it is a €2,000 increase in the cost of heating their home, the cost of electricity or the cost of the mortgage. This is a shock for people. The State should look at dusting down the type of measure we used to have, refining it for the times we are in, and having a tailor-made, targeted and time-bound measure that brings back mortgage interest relief.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1049">As the Deputy and the House will be aware, mortgage interest relief for principal private residences was phased out on a gradual basis over the period between 2009 and 2020. The decision to abolish this relief was taken in the wake of the financial crisis, with the cost of the relief being one of the influencing factors. For example, in 2008 the scheme cost in excess of €700 million per annum. In addition, it should be noted that prior to its eventual abolition, the top two income deciles accounted for close to half the tax forgone through tax relief. This was an issue highlighted in the findings of the Commission on Taxation's 2009 report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> I am aware there has been an increase in certain mortgage rates by some lenders. However, it is important to note that mortgage interest rates, and in particular fixed interest rates, have fallen over the past number of years. It is also worth noting that a significant proportion of new mortgages are now fixed-rate mortgages and this will play a role in the event that interest rates continue to go up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> The introduction or reintroduction of this relief for principal private residences is not the best course of action to assist homeowners with rising rates and would also be very costly. The latest Central Bank data indicate that there were approximately 719,500 primary dwelling mortgage accounts at the end of June, with an outstanding balance of €98.7 billion. The average interest rate at the end of September was approximately 2.7%. Using those data as a guide, if this relief were reintroduced and granted at the standard rate of income tax, it could cost in the region of €500 million per annum. Even the reintroduction of a more tailored form of this relief would involve very significant costs. For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">I am going to press the amendment. It does not call for the introduction for the relief, as the Minister has said, at the standard rate. It calls on the Department to put forward a model that is targeted and tailored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The Minister and the House will be well aware that at different times during the phasing out of this relief right up to 2011, because the rates then reduced, in certain years it cost €50 million and in others it was higher and so on. On that basis, it is the right use of resources. It is the relief that is required for individuals at this point in time due to the shock they feel in their income and I will, therefore, press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1190">I move amendment No. 13:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1191">In page 65, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1192"><b>“Report on pension tax reliefs and subsidies</b><b>24.</b> The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the tax reliefs and subsidies applicable to pensions, including contributions and at drawdown, to assess their cost to the Exchequer and distributional impact.”. </p>
          <p eId="para_1193">This amendment is about publishing a report on the tax reliefs and subsidies applicable to pensions, including contributions and, at drawdown, to assess their cost to the Exchequer and distributional impact. It is important we support individuals in terms of planning for their retirement. However, given that pension reliefs amount to €2.7 billion per annum in revenue foregone, greater than the entire expenditure this year on the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we must examine the value for money and equity of these reliefs. </p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> If anybody were to see an image of the percentile that actually avails of these reliefs, they will see they are not, in the main, going to low or middle income earners. Indeed, one would argue they are not even going to the high income earners. The majority is going to the 1% at the very top. That is an issue that needs to be addressed in terms of value for money and the equity of the reliefs. </p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> Ireland, in common with other advanced economies, taxes pensions under a regime characterised as exempt, exempt and taxed. The income is exempt from tax when it is first received and paid into the pension, exempt from tax as the revenue or returns accrue within the pension and are then taxed when the funds are withdrawn from the pension. </p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> On average, over three quarters of a million people make contributions every month through employer payrolls, representing about 30% of employees, on average. We recognise that many of those contributions are very modest, as the distributional impact will show. The data will also show that in 2019, 4,200 individuals with incomes above €300,000, that is, the top 1% of income distribution in the State, availed of pension contributions totalling €87 million, costing the taxpayer approximately €350 million. The question we pose in this amendment is how is that fair and equitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> The Commission on Taxation and Welfare also drew attention to the fact that there is no up-to-date data on the tax expenditure report on tax relief on pension lump sums, with the most recent estimates being €134 million in 2014. The type of figures I have mentioned are lotto territory for a lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">They could only dream of this situation. The reality is that people do pension planning and the State contributes 40% of their contributions to their pension in the form of tax reliefs. For every euro that goes into their pension the State basically puts 40 cent into it through this pension tax relief. The idea is that when someone starts to draw down the pension, he or she will pay tax at 40%. Not everybody will pay tax at 40% depending on their annual income at that time. A pension may be below that threshold and the person only pays 20% tax and, therefore, the system as designed did not really work. However, many people with high net wealth plan their pensions in terms of lump sums. Despite the fact that the taxpayer contributed 40% to the income that has gone into their pension, they are able to draw down €200,000 tax free and then a further €300,000 that is only taxed at 20%. That results in effect in a €500,000 lump sum where they only pay 60% into it. If €500,000 goes into such a pension pot, approximately €200,000 is contributed by the State. That is a serious issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> According to the distributional impact of this, the top 1% of earners, which comprises 4,200 individuals, all of whom earn above €300,000, benefit. Some earn more than €1 million. We are subsidising gold-plated pensions for these individuals. This is not about the teacher, doctor or the person working in the factory who the State is supporting to grow their pension in the future. This is actually looking at whether this is equitable. How do we stand over a situation where people are able to go to the maximum limit of what they can push into their pension knowing that 40% of that is contributed by the taxpayer and then when they draw it down, they can structure it in such a way that some of it has no tax applied to it and some has the lower rate of tax applied? As I said this involves €350 million and 4,200 individuals, all of whom are in the top 1% of earners in this State. It is not a good resource or use of public funding. The thresholds and limits need to be adjusted so that the State is not subsidising gold-plated pensions. That is what the amendment is about.</p>

          <p eId="para_1200">I am going to ask my officials to look at the issue of refundable tax credits in the context of the tax strategy group, TSG, process which will be done next year and will lead to reports being made available to the public before budget 2024. I listened to the issues that Deputy Doherty raised on Committee Stage. It is worth making the point that the very high income earners to whom he refers also play an important role in either the creation of employment in our country and the payment of income tax in a very progressive tax code that I acknowledged earlier. That said the issue to which this amendment refers is the concept of refundable tax credits and that matter will be looked at in the TSG process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">Excuse me. I apologise to the Dáil and to the Deputy in that regard. As he will be aware we operate a pension system where contributions and pension fund gains are exempt from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed. Where data is available in regard to the Exchequer cost of tax relief for pensions, it is publicly available and included in the Revenue Commissioners publication. With regard to distributional analysis I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that prior to the introduction of real-time reporting on 1 January 2019 pension contributions were reported to the Revenue at an employer level rather than at an employee level. While there were some delays in the processing and publication of the 2019 data, it has been published. Analysis by the Revenue Commissioners of the 2019 figures indicates that pension deductions by employers and employees totalled €4.5 billion. These included contributions to occupational pensions, additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, contributions to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, and contributions to retirement annuity contracts. On average, 775,000 people were making pension contributions every month through employer payrolls. This represented approximately 30% of all employees on average and more than 875,000 employees made pension contributions at some point in 2019. Those with higher incomes make greater contributions to their pensions but the average share of income set aside as pension contributions is relatively consistent across the income ranges and is typically 3% to 6%. However, more data is needed in this area. The pensions reform and taxation group, which reported in November 2020, is tasked with a number of actions related to the pensions roadmap, one of which is an assessment of the cost of State support for pension savings. That work is currently being done. The report notes that the tax treatment of pensions represents one of the largest Exchequer tax expenditures. However the exact cost of this is difficult to quantify due to the general nature of tax expenditures and specific pension-related challenges such as limited data availability and some features of the pension regime in Ireland. It is, therefore, challenging to capture the exact data needed to analyse comprehensively the varying types of pension relief. Having regard to the work that is under way as part of the task force group to consider how the data available on tax relief for pensions can be improved as well as the fact that more detailed information is now available following PAYE modernisation, I do not believe that a further report is needed. This work needs to be done and will be done but I do not believe that the amendment will play a role in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1203">We use the mechanism relating to reports because that is the restriction placed on Opposition spokespersons. However, I agree with the Minister that we do not need more reports as we have the data. We have the data that indicates that the 1% in the State, the top earners who earn more than €250,000, some of whom earn far more than €1 million, are availing of massive pension tax reliefs at a cost to the Exchequer that ordinary workers cannot access because they do not have the resources to put into their pension at that level. We are funding to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro gold-plated pensions. That should stop. I have long argued with the Minister that this can be done in terms of the standard fund threshold and the earning limits. There are ways and mechanisms to ensure that the distributional impact of the large support we put in place for people in terms of pension tax reliefs are not completely skewed to the 1%. I regret that the Minister has not taken action on this either this year or any other year. For that reason I press this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1204">I have made the key points on this. The average level of income that is set aside as per differing levels of income within our economy is reasonably consistent at 3% to 6%. Many of the individuals to whom the Deputy is referring as the 1% play an important role in the generation of income, employment and important public services in our country and who through our progressive tax code pay a large share of the tax revenue that is collected within our State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1205">While the Minister defends the issue of gold-plated pensions, I reiterate that 4,200 individuals, all earning more than €300,000 are benefiting from the taxpayer to the tune of €350 million in tax reliefs. Essentially the taxpayer is putting money into their pension pots.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">I cannot stand over that. There are mechanisms. Yes, they have high incomes and they pay tax at the rate that is set down in law. The question here is how much we should subsidise somebody's pension. In my view, the policy objective should be to ensure that people are able to retire on a relatively comfortable income but when we are talking about the 1%, we are talking about a huge amount of pension tax relief that is skewed completely in their direction. It is wrong and inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> Within our taxation of pensions, we have upper limits which allow us to make sure it is not completely exploited by the top 1%. For example, there is a point where, when the fund gets to €2 million, people cannot avail of any other pension tax relief. There is an age limit restriction depending on the age of the individual, and the amount of income can be up to €115,000. By adjusting those, if we wanted, or if the Minister desired a policy that did not just put taxpayers’ money into the pockets of the 1% but actually had a more distributional impact in regard to this tax relief, we could alter those two issues to make sure that people on average incomes and even those on high incomes would not be impacted, but only those at the top, the 1% of income earners in the State. Let us remember that the other 99% would not be impacted, but the 1% should not be able to avail of as much pension tax relief as they currently are because they do not need it. That is the point I am making. For that reason, I will press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1209">In page 65, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1210">
            <b>“Report on introduction of refundable tax credits to income tax system</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1211"><b>24. </b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the introduction of refundable tax credits to the income tax system, options for their design, associated costs, and impact in addressing social and policy objectives such as reducing in-work poverty.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">This amendment deals with the issue of refundable tax credits in the income tax system and is looking at options for their design, associated costs and impact in addressing social and policy objectives, such as reducing in-work poverty. Currently, introducing refundable tax credits would not be allowed in the income tax system and it cannot be accommodated under existing legislation. Whether someone is working part-time for a few hours each week or is in a very highly paid job, everybody who is in employment in Ireland has tax credits. Once an individual's tax liability has been calculated, these tax credits are applied in order to bring down their tax bill. However, if a low income worker does not earn enough to use their full allocation of tax credits, then they will not benefit from any income tax reductions introduced by the Government in the annual budget via increases to PAYE or personal tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> Making tax credits refundable would be a simple solution to this problem. It would mean that the part of the tax credit that the employee did not benefit from would be refunded. Essentially, what this means is it would be paid at the end of the tax year to him or her by the Revenue Commissioners. The major advantage to making tax credits refundable lies in addressing the disincentives currently associated with low paid employment, and the main beneficiaries of refundable tax credits would be those low paid employees both in full-time and part-time work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> Most people with regular incomes and jobs would not receive any cash refund because their incomes would be too high and they would simply continue to benefit in the same way as before. However, for other people on low or irregular incomes, the refundable tax credit could be paid via a refund from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the year and there may even be scope for more real-time delivery of the benefit, given the new real-time reporting system in place at Revenue in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> There are benefits to introducing refundable tax credits through the income tax system. They include that it would address the problem identified in a straightforward and cost-effective manner, there would not be any administrative cost to the employer and, crucially, it would incentivise employment over welfare as it would widen the gap between pay and welfare rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> The Commission on Taxation and Welfare did look at refundable tax credits and its view was expressed a decade ago. It did not explore this proposal for reform in any great detail and, therefore, I believe it merits further consideration by the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1217">As I indicated earlier, the issue of refundable tax credits is something my Department looked at a number of years ago but I believe it now merits further consideration. On Committee Stage, I said that this would be done through the Tax Strategy Group, TSG, process. I do not believe the implementation of this will be as simple as Deputy Doherty is saying, but I accept it is a matter that needs further consideration and it will happen in that process.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1218">Obviously, the policy decision in regard to refundable tax credits requires consideration, which is why we in Sinn Féin have been putting this forward for many years. I am glad to hear the Minister say it warrants further consideration because, again, this is a change in attitude from this Minister, his party and the Government. We have had this debate and I have put forward this type of proposal every year to the Minister and his predecessors, and it has been stood against. It makes sense and that is why it is important to have a look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219"> One point is that we have designed many complex ways of providing support for individuals as an Oireachtas. We have passed legislation that has put an onus on Revenue to provide weekly payments to employers based on the wages of their employees, and we have placed huge challenges on them. As I have said time and again through my years as finance spokesperson, and even in the aftermath of the crash, if there is one organisation that can hold its head up high, it has been the Revenue Commissioners over the last period. They have always stood up when asked to do so and have been able to give effect to the policy changes that have arisen from this House and, in some cases, they have really had to stretch themselves in the timeframe that was required of them. Nothing is ever straightforward but if there is a policy to direct funding to some of our low income employees, those who are quite vulnerable in terms of their take-home pay, I definitely think it is within the reach and wisdom of the Revenue Commissioners to be able to direct this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> What we need is the discussion. I look forward to seeing the tax strategy papers next summer and, hopefully, they will agree with my assessment that we need this and that we needed it in the past. This amendment talks about refundable tax credits. I would argue that tax credits are there to support low and middle income employees. I would also argue that when someone reaches a certain point on the income threshold, that policy objective is no longer there. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, everybody in the State gets tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> As an example, I will use the figure of €300,000. I believe those in the 1%, the highest income earners in the State, do not need tax credits. At that point, the policy objective is not about supporting them or reducing their tax liability. As I said, the Labour Party in Britain introduced this many years ago and it was continued by the Tory party. This means that when a certain point in someone's income is reached, they start to lose their credits, not all at once and there is no cliff edge but they lose their credits based on the amount of income they receive above a certain threshold. I strongly argue that when someone is on €100,000, they need to start losing their credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> I will leave it at that. I welcome the commitment from the Government to look at this in the Tax Strategy Group papers. </p>

          <p eId="para_1224">I move amendment No. 15:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1225">In page 65, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1226">
            <b>“Reports</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1227"><b>24. </b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the revenue gained from increasing corporation tax to 25 per cent for corporations with over €800,000 in profits and in closing loopholes that exist that allow corporations to hugely reduce their rate of tax.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">I start with a specific point regarding loopholes that exist to allow corporations to significantly reduce their rate of tax. I will ask the Minister a question that I have put to the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach but to which I have not received a fully reply. <i>The Irish Times </i>reported in July that it had been informed by Department of Finance officials that the European Court of Justice, ECJ, hearings on the Apple tax case were likely to be held in autumn and the court would give the State four to six weeks' notice that those hearings were about to begin in advance of a final decision on the case - the biggest tax case in corporate history - next year. I asked the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach the following questions. Do the State and the Department of Finance have any information as to the timing of those hearings? Will they take place before Christmas or in the new year? If it is the latter, when in the new year will they take place? Alternatively, does the State have no information whatsoever on this matter? I cannot imagine that there has not been contact between the Department of Finance and the relevant ECJ sources in that regard. If the Minister were to provide the House with that information, I would appreciate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> On the substantive issue of the amendment, what is the Minister's estimate for total corporation profits for 2022? I have tried to estimate total corporate profits for previous years. For example, we are told that the <i>de facto </i>rate of corporation tax paid in 2020 was closer to 8% than to 12.5%. Depending on whose estimate one goes by, it seems likely that corporation tax receipts this year will be approximately €20 billion. Perhaps the Minister can give the most up-to-date estimate in that regard. If it is €20 billion at a <i>de facto</i> rate of 8%, that would point towards total corporate profits of €250 billion. I do not know whether the rate this year will be 8%, 9%, 10% or some other percentage. I ask the Minister to give the House his best estimate as to what the total corporate profits are likely to be this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> Irrespective of the figure the Minister provides, I know for a fact that it will relate to a vast quantity of untaxed wealth. At a time when workers on the lowest rate of income tax are paying at a rate of 20%, what will be paid by the corporations that are making fabulous profits will be not just less than that, it will be considerably less. The argument used by the Minister and the senior officials in his Department against raising corporation tax to the 20% rate for which others have advocated, or to anything above 15% is that if that is done, is that there will be a flight of capital. In other words, multinational investment will leave the country and the State may end up with a smaller tax take than if the rate was lower. However, I have yet to see convincing information and data to support that argument. Apart from anything else, that is why I would like to get the report to which the amendment refers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> Many serious commentators on the economy point to foreign direct investment in the State being based on other factors, such as access to the European Union and European markets, the State having an English-speaking workforce and population, the high level of education and so on. I would like to see a report placed before the House in order that these issues can be debated, rather than hearing arguments that are based on scaremongering and an attempt to panic people with the idea that if corporations were asked to pay a rate of tax that is not too much above the rate paid by workers on the lowest wages, who pay the lowest rate of income tax, they will leave the country. Let us have the report and be able to debate the issue on the basis of what it reveals. The key point is that there are vast amounts of untaxed profits and wealth at a time of incredible social need. I do not have to point to the 11,000 people in emergency accommodation or the 30, 40 or 50 other examples I could give. We need a realistic debate on these issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1232">On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister about the projections for corporate pre-tax gross profits. I just found the note in that regard. To be honest, it is unbelievable. Deputy Barry just estimated what it might be, but it is way in excess of that. This is newsworthy. I do not know if the Minister has put this information out there, but Janey Mac. The Minister is estimating that gross pre-tax corporate profits for 2022 were €348 billion. That is astonishing. To put that in perspective, the figure for 2020, which is the most recent available and to which Deputy Barry just referred, is €193 billion. There has been a jump in profits of more than €150 billion in two years. From 2012 to 2020, there was a jump from €74 billion to €193 billion. Those are the figures on which I was working in the context of our pre-budget submission. That is a 157% increase in profits in eight years. Now it has taken another jump. I have not done the percentage calculation, but it has jumped another €150 billion in two years. That is unbelievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> We have seen a bonanza in corporate profitability like never before and that has accelerated at an extraordinary rate in the past two years. We should bear in mind that in those two years, ordinary working people were crushed by cost-of-living increases and lost between €4,000 and €6,000 in the value of their income in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">This is because of corporations, including energy and pharmaceutical corporations, all the big IT companies and so on - we could go through the list - are jacking up prices to reach these simply dizzying levels of profitability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> Deputy Barry slightly understated the degree of tax relief these corporations are getting. In 2020, on €193 billion in pre-tax profits, €11 billion was paid in tax, which is a rate of 6.1%. It is not 8%, 10% or 12.5% but 6.1%. I have not worked out the percentage for the new figures the Minister has just given us but if he is projecting that he will get €21 billion in tax, and is estimating that on the basis of pre-tax profits of €348 billion, if these corporations paid 12.5%, never mind 15%, 20% or 25%, they would pay €40.8 billion in tax. We can more or less work it out; they are paying between 5% and 6% tax on their pre-tax profits. That is what they are actually paying. That is shocking and shameful. We could almost double corporate tax revenue if we just made them pay an effective minimum rate of 12.5%. In my opinion, the rate should go right up. These companies should at least pay the level of taxation the average worker is expected to pay on his or her income, but could we not even just make them pay the 12.5%? An extra €20 billion would then be available. When we consider what that could do for the housing crisis, the resourcing and staffing of our health service, public transport, higher education, wages for workers, all the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, and the cost of housing it is, quite frankly, staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> This is never really talked about and, as Deputy Barry indicated, the Government's only argument against it is that if it raised the level of taxation, these companies would all run away. The Minister may have noticed they are starting to run away anyway when it comes to jobs, which has nothing to do with the tax measures taken by the Government and everything to do with international events that have nothing to do with our tax policy. It has to do with the fact that these corporations have disproportionate wealth that could be called profit driven and egotistical. I probably should not use some of the adjectives I could use to describe people like Elon Musk and so on but what happens when that much profit and control of the global economy is given to one individual, or wealthy multibillionaires, is that we eventually see the sort of jobs massacre we are seeing anyway. Surely, the thing to do is make these companies pay their taxes now, while the going is good, in order to give us the revenues we need to invest in housing, health and key infrastructure rather than continuing to give them massive tax breaks, deductions, reliefs, tax credits and so on, where they pay a fraction of the tax ordinary workers pay. </p>

          <p eId="para_1241">This amendment relates to a report on corporation taxes. It states: "The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, bring forward a report on Government plans to reduce and mitigate the reliance of the public finances on windfall corporation tax receipts."</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> If we have learned anything from the past two years, it is that very little can be predicted and, often, the things that shake our country up most are global shocks and things over which we have no control, such as Covid, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis we currently face. What we have seen and heard from previous contributions is that the country has received a significant input of revenue from corporation taxes. Central Statistics Office figures published today showed corporation taxes were €15 billion, which accounts for 16% of the taxes we accrue in this country. That is double what it was in 2017 and that figure is forecast to rise to €21 billion. We also hear there is a general consensus that these taxes are essentially one-offs and it is very unlikely to be the case that they will be repeated. These corporation taxes are taxes that are heavily influenced by what happens in the global economy. The Department of Finance's chief economist has raised concerns, or cautioned, that the slowdown in the global tech sectors poses a risk to corporation tax receipts next year and into 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> We need to take a very prudent approach to these corporation taxes, and recognise this particular downturn in the tech sector and what is happening in that sector as a wake-up call to us. We now need to be very prudent regarding corporation taxes and how we manage them but also how we plan for the future. We cannot rely on them forever. It would be prudent at this stage to develop a plan on how we will deal with any downturn in those taxes and mitigate our reliance on those finances. This amendment is simple and pretty self-explanatory. I hope the Minister will support it because essentially all we are asking for is a report, and for the Government to plan and be proactive in this instance. I would be interested to hear the Minister's opinion on this amendment. I hope he is supportive of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1246">I do not have information relating to the case. As I said, I imagine that at this point it will probably be next year but that is just my judgment. We do not have guidance regarding when it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> Deputy Boyd Barrett made reference to the note I shared with him regarding trying to provide a range on the impact of corporations and large employers on our economy in 2022 and 2023. At the base of the note, it states very clearly that the gross operating surplus he referred to is not a measure used in tax calculations. To be very clear, this is not the same as profitability. It is not an estimate of taxable profits. It does not take account of capital allowances or interest deductions. The figure he referred to is one we use in trying to assess the impact of larger companies on our economy but it is not a figure that is equivalent to taxable income. I wanted to be very clear on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> On the impact of these companies on our economy, the one word I did not hear referenced in contributions from the Opposition is that these companies we are referring to are huge employers and taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Amid the debate on corporate tax receipts and the different structures and reliefs referred to, mainly in Deputies Barry and Boyd Barrett's amendments, all of the focus is on tax and on how we can increase tax in respect of the elimination of intragroup transfers to which I know Deputy Boyd Barrett has a principled opposition and that I have heard on many different occasions. All of these huge corporations, which are huge global presences, have a presence in Ireland that leads to the employment of many tens of thousands of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> Deputy Barry asked about the data that are available to indicate that, if these tax rates were to change in the way we want, it would have an impact on their employment and investment in Ireland. The only data I can give him is my direct experience. Again and again, I have seen that the level of tax companies pay in Ireland and the level of tax they expect to pay in the future are very important ingredients in their presence in our country, their investment in our economy, and the number of people they employ in Ireland. In my engagement with many of these companies over many years, the level of tax they pay and the predictability of that tax in the future are very important factors in their presence in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> I agree with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry that it is not the only factor. The quality of our workforce, education levels in our country and our long-term relationship with many of these employers are also very important ingredients in why Irish companies develop their scale and presence in Ireland and why very large companies have also been present in Ireland for so many decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> Regarding the very large increase in corporate profitability referred to by both Deputies, it is important to note there has also been a sixfold increase in the level of corporate profitability in Ireland, so as global corporate profitability has gone up, so has the amount of corporate tax paid in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> Regarding Deputy Whitmore's amendment, which looked at the impact of corporate tax on our total tax take, it has grown. The Deputy spoke about the need for a plan to deal with any vulnerability we may have as a result of our reliance on corporate tax receipts. We do have a plan. It is why we have the National Reserve Fund. It is why we have set aside €4 billion to go into the National Reserve Fund for next year because the predictions regarding some of this being one-off tax revenue are coming from me and my Department. This is why, for next year, we are making the decision not to spend €4 billion of those corporate tax receipts. It is why we made the decision this year not to spend €2 billion of it because I have acknowledged this risk is there. It is also the reason, as our corporate tax receipts have increased again since 2019, we have not transferred those higher levels of corporate tax receipts to ongoing permanent spending or ongoing permanent tax reduction. It is why we are running a surplus this year. It is why I want to run another surplus next year. It is why we have put €6 billion into the National Reserve Fund. The safest insurance policy in respect of those higher levels of corporate tax receipts is not to get into the habit of spending them, and we are not doing so, because we are running a surplus and setting up two different deposits into the reserve fund for this year and next year in total equal to €6 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">In 1958, the State took the decision to open up the economy and invite in foreign direct investment. Irish capitalism had failed miserably. The massive emigration of the 1950s at a time when the post-war boom was well under way internationally was a sure sign of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> The State's economic policy has been based on that for more than 60 years. The cracks in it are really beginning to open up. First, the other capitalist states are saying Ireland has carved out an unfair competitive advantage by organising a tax haven. I am not the only person to say it. Joseph Stiglitz has said it. I think all ten of the top academic papers on this issue reference it. The European Parliament has said that by an overwhelming majority. We now have a tightening up, hence the 15%. Ten percent of the State's taxes is reliant on the top ten multinationals in the country. We saw with Twitter and the decisions taken by Elon Musk how precarious that can be. These are decisions made in boardrooms that the Irish State cannot control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> All of this points to the need for a new and different economic model. We will have an opportunity some other time but I will make the point that we do that by breaking with the for-profit model and system, not relying on foreign direct investment or Irish capitalism, which is still as weak as it was in the 1950s, comparatively speaking, and choosing an economy driven by State investment and run for the needs of the people rather than the profits of the few. That is a debate we will have another day.</p>

          <p eId="para_1257">To be clear, I am fully aware the figure is not the taxable profit. Indeed it is precisely the point I make year after year. There are gross profits and then there is a myriad of tax reliefs, deductions and allowances that write down the taxable profit. That is the problem. Workers get a few tax credits but they do not see the level of write-down in what is taxable in their income that these corporations get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> The figure for 2020 pre-tax profits was €193 billion. The taxable income after all the loopholes was €110 billion. This is a massive write-down of what was taxable. Workers do not get anything like that in terms of the deductions and allowances that are available to them. The effective rate is about 6.1%, so it is very important to look at what the gross pre-tax profits are. We can then get a sense of what these companies are earning, which is astronomical. It is now up to, and this is a newsflash, €348 billion projected. You project for next year and it will be up to €383 billion, but the Minister estimates that, this year, they will only pay €21 billion in tax when a 12.5% tax on that would give us €40 billion. Even if you allow for a few legitimate allowances, it would be very considerably higher than the €21 billion. Given how precarious these companies have now shown themselves to be, surely now is the time to get in and get what we can off them from a tax point of view to invest in developing industry and jobs that will actually be sustainable in the long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_1259">We asked for a report to be brought forward on those plans. We looked for analysis of the risks and mitigation - all the different measures the Minister is looking at to deal with the reliance of public finances on windfall corporation taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">It is important that not only is this report undertaken and brought forward, but also that a discussion is facilitated on it in this House. One of the criticisms of the rainy day fund measure last year was that only two minutes were given to each party to discuss the saving of €6 billion in that fund. It is important, therefore, that we have a discussion about this aspect of the legislation and that the Minister outlines what he is doing, why he is doing it, what risks he is considering, what analysis he is taking into account and what modelling he is doing on this issue. It is too big a matter for there to be no debate and no transparency. This is not something that only the Minister's Government is going to be dealing with. The consequences of this proposal will be something that all subsequent Governments will have to deal with for the foreseeable future, so it is important that there is a collective debate on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1261">I thank the Deputies. Starting with Deputy Barry, the opening of our economy since 1958, the role of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland and our relationship with the Single Market has been a huge success. It has led to an extraordinary transformation in living standards in our country. If the period up to 1958 and the early 1960s showed that an inward-looking model of investment and employment could not work for our economy and was going to lead to living standards that would not meet the needs of our society, then surely the last number of decades have shown that, despite the many challenges we have, an open economic model, being open to international investment and helping Irish companies to grow in a global economy and in the European Single Market has been a great economic success for our country and a massively positive economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> Turning to Deputy Boyd Barrett, some of the companies I believe he is referring to have been in Ireland for decades. Even with the risks which exist and are growing, there is every possibility they will still be here for decades to come. I always think the Deputy has a sense that they are ready to flee. I guess he would argue that I am arguing that changes in taxation may increase this risk even further. The reality, however, is that many of the companies the Deputy is referring to, and of which he is critical, have been in this State for decades and have played a role in employing so many tens of thousands of people over many years. I argue that these companies have been, and will continue to be, a strong and important pillar in our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> On the points made by Deputy Whitmore, we have in the annual tax report from the Department of Finance exhaustively covered off corporate tax vulnerabilities in great detail for many years. There is not a publication from my Department about the overall structure and performance of our economy that does not include a significant focus on the corporate tax issue. There have been a large number of publications from my Department, as well as a great deal of commentary, including from me, in this regard over many years. Whatever the limitations of our debate, a lack of reports on this issue is not one of them. We are acting on them in the form of the surplus and by setting up the National Reserve Fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_1268">I will speak briefly on this amendment. The facts, figures and statistics in this regard have been quoted many times in this House. I am not going to recite them again. These large profits, and in some cases the massive profits, are being made by these energy corporations at the same time as ordinary customers are experiencing massive increases in gas and electricity prices. My basic point is that we are witnessing a transfer of wealth from ordinary people towards the big companies, their shareholders, etc. This needs to be reversed by placing a levy on these companies, which would offset the price increases. I note that in recent days the Government has stated it is going to introduce a windfall profits tax. If that is the case, then the Government should support this amendment.

          <p eId="para_1269">Energy policy, including the increasing costs of energy supply and taxation and profit, is a matter of key concern to the Government. In April, the Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework, which sets the overarching response to the impact of the war in Ukraine on the energy system here in Ireland. In late September, Ireland, along with our fellow member states, agreed a new EU regulation to tackle high energy pricing in a co-ordinated way. It contains two revenue-raising measures which will address the windfall profits currently being made by some energy companies. These are a temporary solidarity contribution based on excess taxable profits for the fossil-fuel production and oil-refining sector and a cap on market revenues for specific technologies in the electricity sector which have not seen significant increases in costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270"> The regulation prescribes how the proceeds from both these measures are to be utilised, including providing financial support to final energy users, such as vulnerable households and businesses. Energy policy is under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are currently supporting that Department in the implementation of the regulation. The Government has also taken several other measures to reduce the burden on consumers in respect of the cost of energy. This includes providing a total of €800 of electricity credits to every domestic electricity account holder in the country, an additional fuel allowance payment, reductions in fuel excise duty and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271"> As Deputy Barry will be aware, on Tuesday the Government agreed to be part of the EU-wide framework in respect of how the energy sector will be taxed. Our participation in this EU framework on these issues is the best way for a small, open economy like ours to tax excess profits that are, or could, be going to become available across 2023. The measures, and the way they have been designed by the Directorate of Energy, get the balance right between taxing levels of profits that could become very high for reasons that have nothing to do with the companies concerned and all to do with the impact of the war on the functioning of the electricity sector and the functioning of the price of gas and the profit available to companies involved in this sector, while still recognising the role of investment in this sector and important role it can play in the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272"> What we are also going to be introducing in this legislation will be the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. This will support businesses whose average unit gas or electricity price has risen by more than 50% compared to the average unit gas or electricity price in 2020. This will be a significant measure. It will be one that up to the end of February 2023 we believe will involve the spending of up to €1.2 billion of the country's money to support small-and-medium businesses during what we know will be a difficult time. Taking into account the measures the Government is taking with regard to the taxation of the sector and the supports that will be available to small-and-medium-sized businesses, I cannot therefore support this amendment.</p>

            <b>“Reports</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1308"><b>40.</b>	Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 (Film Tax Relief), to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Production of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further ensure genuinely equitable remuneration or performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">We discussed this at considerable length on Committee Stage but I would like to give it one last airing. This relates to the section 481 film tax relief. I will read the amendment into the record so that it is clear what we are trying to do here. It states that within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 film tax relief, to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC, that is, the designated activity company ,which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further ensure genuinely equitable remuneration for performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">Why would I want that? It is critical that if we are giving out €100 million in State aid to the arts, in this case, specifically to the film industry, it is in compliance, not only with national law but also with European directives. I say that, and always predicate everything I say, as somebody who wants to see that much money and more go into Irish film and into arts and culture. I was one of the few people who noted that the arts and culture budget was cut marginally this year and condemned that fact. We need to put more money into arts and culture because we have an absolutely fantastic pool of creative people in this country. We have a tremendous tradition and reputation in all of the arts; poetry, music, theatre, dance, acting, film etc. I want to see more but I am deeply concerned that we are not vindicating the rights of stage crew and film crew who work in the Irish film industry, particularly in the live-action area of Irish film, or the performers, the writers, the actors and the dancers, and in failing to do so, we are not complying with the requirement to ensure that their rights are upheld and that certain things are achieved when one gives State aid to the film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> I appreciate that the Minister has agreed, following our lengthy discussion, to have some of his officials meet some of the so-called contrarians, that is, the people who are critical of the way the current structure of section 481 relief is operating and I genuinely appreciate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> I ask the Minister to understand that it is very serious if we are required to comply with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and for the film producers who receive section 481 relief to tell us and the Minister that such compliance is impossible. I looked back at the transcripts of both what Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, stated at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, what has been alleged by groups such as the Irish Film Workers Association and what, in effect, was accepted by the Minister. On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that maybe we can sort these things out through discussion and negotiation. I thought maybe we could and then I thought, no actually while discussions are welcome, there is nothing to be discussed when it comes to compliance with the law. I want the Minister to consider that and make me a commitment if a serious allegation is being made that the recipients of section 481 relief are not in compliance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. They have stated they cannot be because of the DAC structure and that it is not possible for somebody to acquire a contract of indefinite duration through the operation of law under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. That is what they have said because the DAC does not survive, project to project, longer than 18 months. The Minister echoed what they are telling him, that it is not possible, but it has to be possible because it is in EU law and it is in the declaration they sign. There is something very seriously problematic if one is saying the most fundamental protection for people on fixed-term contracts is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313"> I am looking in front of me - I have not time to quote them - at two cases that have gone to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. One person had 57 fixed-term contracts and has never got a contract of indefinite duration even though under the fixed-term workers directive and the law, that person is required to. Another had 26 such contracts. This is because the people the Minister gives the money to go into the Labour Court and state they could have no employment relationship with these people even though they set up the DAC for the film on which they were employed, in some cases, 26 times, 57 times or whatever it might be over decades. The whole point of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 is to protect workers in that situation. If it cannot apply, there is a serious problem with the form of state aid we are giving, which is specifically designed to create an industry and to create, as the directive states, a permanent pool of skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314"> In 30 seconds, I have not time to mention the performers other than to say they state their intellectual property is essentially being taken off them with buy-out contracts, which the copyright directive requires to be the exception, not the rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">This is what the copyright directive requires. Yet in Irish contracts given by the producers to whom the Minister gives section 481 tax relief, performers and actors are required to sign away their intellectual property rights, which, under the copyright directive, they are not allowed to do. I ask the Minister to respond. If there is any uncertainty about these matters, I genuinely ask that he write to the European Commission and ask for clarification.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1316">I will begin by addressing the amendment concerning copyright and the intellectual property rights of performers and actors. Copyright law falls under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am, however, aware that the issue of copyright is important for Irish culture and arts and for the media sector. I am also aware that there have been issues regarding intellectual property rights and the remuneration of actors and performers. An instance of the latter was highlighted in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's discussion of section 481 film relief. I stated on Committee Stage that the officials are seeking to engage with the stakeholders concerned, including Government stakeholders and representative bodies for actors and performers, in order to gain an understanding of the topic and the various perspectives of those concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317"> I want to refer to the amendments concerning employer rights in the Irish audiovisual sector, particularly in the context of the issue raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett on the use of DACs. The monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the Workplace Relations Commission. I know Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, because we discussed this on Committee Stage, that the Workplace Relations Commission carried out an audit of the sector in recent years and did not make a recommendation with regard to DACs. However, as Deputies aware, I have taken note of the concerns they raised previously in respect of this matter and have made amendments to the section 481 criteria to improve the focus on quality employment and skills development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318"> Applicants for the relief must submit to compliance with all relevant employment legislation on the film being certified. These conditions are to be met not only by the producer company but also by the qualifying company or the DAC. This topic was also discussed recently by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. Following this discussion, the officials have engaged with bodies representing producers and workers. It is the Department's understanding, following this engagement, that standard practice in the film and television industry globally is to operate on a project-to-project basis. However, again as advised on Committee Stage, the officials are available to meet those groups that have a different opinion on such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me to act on the basis of allegations. I cannot give a commitment to do this. Allegations have to be investigated by the relevant State bodies, whether it is the Workplace Relations Commission or the Health and Safety Authority, in the context of the issues he referred to on Committee Stage and just now. I do not doubt the Deputy's bona fides or the legitimacy of some of the issues he has raised, but I cannot raise issues with the European Commission in the way he suggested on the basis of allegations. It is a matter that has to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> On pay and conditions in the sector, I understand that in recent years two collective bargaining agreements have been reached in the sector. These are a shooting crew agreement and a construction crew agreement. Officials have been formed by both crew and producer representative bodies that the rates of pay included in these agreements reflect the project-to-project nature of the work. I appreciate that there are contrasting opinions on employment practices in the sector ,but it is important that I consider the views of all stakeholders in order to avoid any potential unintended consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> I have already dealt with the matter of the DACs. They have a purpose in that they ensure that costs cannot be shifted between various productions and allow for ring-fenced vehicles to make sure that different projects are funded and in different ways. This reminds me of the point Deputy Boyd Barrett and I have debated for some time. As I understand it, this sector is structured on a project-to-project basis. It appears that this project-by-project employment is something Deputy Boyd Barrett wants to change. He wants to see this very basis of the sector shift. Issues on pay and employment contracts are best dealt with through collective agreements and industrial relations mechanisms. They are not dealt with in the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322"> We have already made important changes to section 481 in order to ensure that there is focus on issues which, I acknowledge, are important. We are tracking and listening to the hearings that are under way at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. We note that representatives of Equity who came before the committee said that the way rights are secured in other jurisdictions is through collective bargaining and, I imagine, the use of industrial relations mechanisms. It is in this way that the issues Deputy Boyd Barrett is referring to can be tackled and progress on them can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323"> As I have said previously, we are willing and eager to meet all of the bodies involved in the sector. We have already met some of them. This type of engagement is unusual for the Department, but we are willing to do it because this sector is very important to the economy. I care about the future of the sector and I care about those working in it. I also care about those who invest in it. They have played a role in making it such an important manifestation of a creative economy that I want to see get bigger in the years to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_1324">Section 481 relief is state aid. Therefore, it has to comply with EU directives in this area. People cannot negotiate away their rights. They cannot do that. They are not allowed to do it. I want the Minister to understand the point I am making. People cannot negotiate away their rights. No group that claims to represent the industry can negotiate away their rights. I will send the Minister some of the correspondence from Equity, the Film Workers Association and the writer I quoted briefly who made the same point. They say that the law is not being complied with. This is not an allegation. The Minister has to investigate if there is even a possibility of it being true that either the law or the EU directive regarding state aid are not being complied with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> The point about the DAC is that everything survives the DAC except the employment relationship. This is the only thing that does not survive. This is the evidence we have from the producers. It is not an allegation; they have admitted it. They state no employment relationship can survive the DAC. The fixed-term workers' directive and the Act require that the employment relationship goes beyond the DAC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">That is the point of it. It is to protect people who are in episodic employment relationships. The other thing that survives the DAC is intellectual property, but it accrues to the producer company and not to the people who own it. That is a breach of the copyright directive. One cannot finance a structure that is being used to break the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">The Deputy is making extraordinary allegations. He is saying structures have been put in place that are leading to the breaking of the law in relation to the claiming of state aid and the use of taxpayers' money. If he or the people who are raising this matter with him have evidence, they should report it to the Revenue Commissioners or the Health and Safety Authority or raise it directly with the relevant body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328"> We oversee the implementation of the section 481. We published a thorough overview of the operation of the scheme earlier in the year, in September. If the Deputy believes the law is being broken in that regard, he has a duty to present the evidence in a specific way to the agencies involved in overseeing the law as opposed to making broad allegations in the House about a sector that is, I believe, from the evidence and reports I have, making progress in dealing with issues about workers' rights, living standards and good pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329"> The Deputy claimed you cannot negotiate away rights. I am not asking that anyone does this. What I am saying is collective agreements and engagement through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is the way these matters can be tackled. A classic example of this is the issue referred to by the Deputy about intellectual property. If the Deputy believes the balance is right, regarding the gains from intellectual property, between the producer and those working on individual productions, the way in which progress can be made on those matters, including engagement and negotiations, is with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, more likely, the Workplace Relations Commission on the contracts in place to oversee the allocation of profit.</p>

          <p eId="para_1330">This is complicated and it takes a while to get your head around it. The CEO of Screen Producers Ireland, who struck the agreement referred to by the Minister, gave evidence to the WRC in a case taken by a film crew worker that there was no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties involved. This was on the basis of what she said were the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in the sector, including the operation of section 481 relief. Does the Minister understand what she is saying? She is saying there cannot be a relationship between the film producer company and the worker who works on the film because of the structure of section 481. That is what she said, and the Government is giving these people money. She said that her members cannot have employees because of the way the industry is structured. That is her saying it, yet at the same time, the Government continues to give them the money for quality employment and training purposes, and it takes them seriously when they say they are striking a balance between employers and employees while they say they cannot have employees. Does the Minister not understand what is being said to him?</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">I am saying it is the structure of the relief. I am asking the Minister to go to Europe and ask for an adjudication on this. That is a reasonable thing to ask, is it not? How is that not a reasonable thing to ask, seriously, if there is question mark? Have we not been down this road before with compliance or non-compliance with EU directives, where people had to go all the way to flipping European courts to get adjudications?</p>

            <b>Amendment of Schedule 2 to Finance Act 1999 (rates of mineral oil tax)</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1495"><b>43.</b> The Finance Act 1999 is amended with effect as on and from 28 September 2022 by the substitution of the following for Schedule 2 (amended by section 12 of the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022):</p>

          <p eId="para_1498">This amendment effectively slashes mineral oil tax, which is made up mainly of excise duties and carbon taxes. Based on section 43 of the Bill, the Government plans to revert all mineral oil taxes to the higher thresholds from March 2023. Additionally, this form of taxation will jump significantly in future years as part of the Government's climate action agenda. This will have a devastating impact on motorists and the entire transport sector. For example, the Government reduced excise on petrol to 46 cent per litre in March 2022. At the time, the Rural Independent Group proposed a total cap of 16.5 cent per litre. Now the Government is ploughing ahead with an increase in the mineral oil tax on petrol. It will be 65 cent per litre from March 2023, 67 cent per litre from May 2024, 70 cent per litre from October 2025, and 78 cent per litre from May 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499"> The Government is out of touch with what it is doing to people in the area of transport. With the transition, the Government is delivering a blow to families who are working but have no other option but to travel with a motorised vehicle. In the transport sector, the Government is causing higher costs for the production of food and for transport across this country. It will target low-income people in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1500">I support this amendment, of course. We all know, as should the Minister, who deals with people as much as we do, that by increasing these taxes from next May, this will drive transport costs up. It will hurt people who are going to work in their cars and taking their children to schools. This will hurt people in rural Ireland more than in urban areas. People in rural areas need a car. They cannot travel without a car. The Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications said today that he was proud that the Government was spending so much money on footpaths and cycleways. As I said, when people are travelling long distances to work, a bicycle is no good to them. If they are supposed to walk, they will have to leave the day before if they have to be at work the next day because savage distances are involved. Many people in Kerry work in Cork city and travel the roads morning, noon and night. People may be taking sick people to hospital in Cork, Tralee and other places. It is all travel that cannot be managed without a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501"> Then take the commercial transport industry. This is going to drive the whole thing through the roof again and increase the cost of living in every way, whether it is the transport of food, agricultural goods or whatever. The Government is certainly going to drive the cost of living up further. I cannot understand why it is insisting on this, especially when the base product is so expensive. We are already paying enough taxes and carbon taxes. Even when fuel was €1.20 per litre, there was no need for the carbon tax. People have to use their cars for as long as they can. They cannot manage without them. We gave the Government ideas about liquefied petroleum gas and biofuels, but it will not entertain them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502"> The Government is hell-bent on making people walk or maybe making them go back to using the horse and cart. There is no common sense in what it is doing by increasing the carbon tax again next May. That is totally and absolutely out of order.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1503">This is about the carbon tax and terrible plight of the people over the past number of years. It was brought about by a rosy idea to rob the people of rural Ireland and fill the pockets of those in the cities and bigger towns in order that they can get super transport services that we do not have in rural Ireland. Carbon tax is an absolute direct attack on the people of rural Ireland, and nothing else. The Minister has succeeded in getting a nice, healthy tax take and rosy-looking figures, but this has come at a very high cost to the ordinary mother and father. They are not going to forget that when election day comes. The people in rural constituencies are fuming. They tell me regularly that they cannot afford to put fuel in their cars because of carbon tax and the other taxes the Government has. The Government is engaged in a clean-out when it comes to fuel taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504"> It is the same with agricultural diesel. Farmers are being hit so severely this year due to increased fertiliser prices and other costs. It has been a disastrous year for agriculture. I met a silage contractor from a peninsula north of my home recently. The man was so distressed he was crying. He was in serious trouble. He did not know how he was going to get the money from the farmers because they did not have the money to pay him. His fuel bill was astronomical compared with other years. It is quite frightening. The Government has lost touch with that kind of situation. It has done a greedy tax take and a greedy carbon tax take and used the phrase "climate action" as an umbrella to cover everything. However, it does not cover all. If the price of agricultural diesel and the diesel used by the man driving the truck that brings the food to the shops is skyrocketing, this means that the price of food in the shops is also skyrocketing. It is back again to the mother and father who get up and work hard every day and try their level best to pay their way and pay their bills. They are finding it almost impossible to do so. Quite a number of them cannot do that at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505"> I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to the amendments we have put forward to the effect that carbon tax should be suspended for now. It will not be long before diesel costs €3 per litre at the pump. I would not like to be the politician who supports that and is knocking on the door to pat a person on their back as they look for their vote. As I said, it is a very difficult time for people in farming. One of our amendments was mainly about agricultural diesel. It is an extremely difficult time. There is a vote later on whereby the Government might give some bit of ease to farmers via our Impaired Farm Credit Bill 2022. Surely the Government will not vote against farmers and the people of rural Ireland again on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1506"> Unfortunately, we do not have a public transport service. In rural Ireland, people depend utterly on the car. They are being priced out of it. As I said earlier, climate change is the reason carbon tax has been brought in. At the same time, however, it did not stop Heads of Government flying 400 jets to Egypt last week for this climate discussion. The damage they did to the climate is frightening, but there was no worry about that. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, took 55 officials with him. I do not know whether they were Green Party officials or people from Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, but it was farcical that so many individuals had to go out with one Minister, never mind the Taoiseach, and however many more went with him and the other Ministers who went to Egypt. We will be pressing the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1507">I support this amendment very much. A carbon tax increases the price of goods and services. By design, a carbon tax causes goods and services that involve higher levels of emissions to become relatively more expensive such that consumers will tend to buy less of them or substitute others that involve less carbon-intensive production. Hence, a carbon tax makes coal, oil, natural gas and the electricity they are used to generate more expensive. It also makes goods and services that are delivered by means of their use or that depend heavily on them in the context of their production more expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508"> Is a carbon tax regressive? A tax is regressive if it takes up a larger share of a lower-income household's expenditure. John Podesta, a former adviser to Barack Obama, raised concerns about the equity of carbon taxes by arguing "A real disadvantage of just a pricing scheme is you can’t directly attack the environmental injustice problem". This reflects a broad perception that a carbon tax is regressive after all. The argument is that a carbon tax is a tax on energy and energy is a good that takes up a larger share of the budgets for low-income households than it does for higher-income households. Who is going to be directly affected by this but those who are less able to pay for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1509"> We are an island. Everything rolls; nothing falls out of the sky. I compliment the people involved in our haulage and transport sector. The people in vans might be getting ready as we speak. They might be about to go out working for the night to drive goods across the length and breadth of this country. Who stocks the shops in the morning? Who delivers the newspapers? Who delivers the mail? It is the hauliers and the people involved in that industry. If the cost of fuel and transport is to go up again, all it will do is mean everything has a knock-on effect from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510"> I am sure those in government are very smart. They must realise that we must do everything we can to reduce carbon tax instead of increasing it. It is very simplistic to say we will reduce the amount of carbon we produce by taxing it. There are plenty of other things the Government could do instead of just imposing a tax to stop people living a way of life or using goods they need to use. It is a flawed idea and a flawed ideal. It is so crazy to see at budget time. The Government is imposing a carbon tax that will increase the cost of living for low-income households in particular. What does it do then? It tries to come up with imaginative ways of putting money back into those people's pockets. It is robbing Peter to pay Paul and going around the table in a merry dance. If the Government would only think about what it was doing. If it did not tax people so much in the first instance it would not have to be looking at other ways of trying to give them back money. I cannot see the logic in it. I cannot see the sense in it. I would like to think I am very plausible and reasonable when it comes to looking at arguments put forward by others, but I cannot make sense out of this. There is one thing I will never understand even if I live forever, namely, that people will go around County Kerry canvassing and saying they are on the side of the people and then when they come up here, they completely and absolutely forget those who sent them here in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">They leave those people behind. It is as if they fell into Dáil Éireann in a parachute and nobody had to vote for them to come here at all. It is wrong and unfair. I would remind anyone listening tonight that a politician is a servant of the people. These people forget that. They are there for the betterment of the people. They are sent here to do a job and that is to be a spokesperson for their community and the area they represent. They are to be there for the good of people and to be fair and balanced. How can anybody come in here and press the buzzer to vote for additional taxes and carbon taxes? The Government would tax people for breathing if it could get away with it. How can these people can go back to the people who voted them in and say they forgot about them when they were above in Dublin? They just lined in behind the Minister and voted away and did not really care about them at all but forgot about them. People have memories. People are able to look at what goes on in debates. People are able to follow and see what way people vote. I would ask the people in County Kerry to look at the way people are voting when it comes to representing them here in Dáil Éireann because my goodness, as far as I can see, they are being let down very badly by this Government when it comes to taxation and attacking people at a time when they are vulnerable. We should be doing everything we can with the cost of electricity, insurance, fuel and home heating oil. A bag of coal is nearly €50 and it could possibly be €50 for Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512"> The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is gone on a tangent trying to stop people burning turf. If he had his way, people would perish inside in their homes. He has no consideration whatsoever for people because he seems to be insulated from feeling what the people out there on the ground are feeling. It is a cliche to say the Government has lost touch with reality but it is true when it comes to a person who talks about introducing wolves and car pooling and says we should not have a car of our own. He thinks people should walk down from the hills and the mountains, go to the village and hope there are a couple of cars there and that they might be lucky enough to jump into one and go off on their merry way for the day. He is to be taken seriously as a Minister in a Government. He went off to represent us at a conference recently. He is incapable of doing so without having 50 people to mind him and guide him and hold his hand along the way. It would have been a fine thing if he had stayed at home. We would have been better represented if he did not go at all because if we are sending the wrong man or the wrong woman out we would be better off having nobody there speaking for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_1514">I will be brief. Deputy Healy-Rae was quite hard on the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications given that this Bill gives people €3,000 for a bicycle with a basket on the front. God forbid if people have to go up the road with their car because they will be paying for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515"> I have four amendments in this grouping relating to carbon tax and the price of petrol and diesel. We understand the limitations around the energy directive from the European Union but these all fit within the energy tax directive. That allows the Government additional scope to reduce the price of petrol, diesel and marked gas oil, which particularly affects the agricultural sector, and also reduce the price of home heating oil. Let me be very clear: what we want to do in these amendments is reduce petrol by a further 15 cent, diesel by 12 cent and reduce the cost of a 1,000 l fill of home heating oil by €117. What this Government has done to the 37% of families in the State that heat their homes with home heating oil is nothing less than a disgrace. It is absolutely disgraceful that that has happened. That is more pronounced in areas like my own and Deputy Healy-Rae's, rural communities where two thirds of families will be using home heating oil to keep them warm this winter. The temperatures have dropped in the last week. Yet this Government has decided that there should be no decrease whatsoever. Indeed, what it is asking us to do, and what it would vote for if it had an opportunity but unfortunately we will not get one, is to increase the cost of home heating oil again next year. That is just absolutely disgraceful. It is out of touch. All the backbenchers in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, when this debate is guillotined in the next few minutes, should remember what they are voting for. They are voting to put up the price of home heating oil again in this Finance Bill. It makes no sense whatsoever. It is an ideological battle that Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party are fighting but it is out of touch with the reality of where people are at. People are buying home heating oil by the jar. They are not phoning up and looking for a 500 l or 1,000 l fill. They are buying it by 5 gallon drums because they cannot afford to fill their tanks. The Government is so out of touch and so under a rock when it comes to the pressures that real people are facing, particularly in the country, that they sat around the Cabinet table and decided to put up the price of home heating oil a little bit further, despite the facts. The facts are that home heating oil has increased by 145% since January of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516"> The other disgrace is that this Bill is coming to a guillotine. The Government has imposed a guillotine on this. We are at amendment No. 30. We cannot deal with so many other amendments, amendments I put down that I did not even get a chance to discuss because of the guillotine that has been imposed. We are dealing with another issue in this Bill as well. Every backbencher should hear this. When they come in in a minute to vote for this Bill, they are voting to put up the price of housing through the levy they are putting on concrete blocks and poured concrete. I would also point out to the Minister, if I had a chance to discuss this amendment, that there is a flaw in how the legislation is drafted and it will come back to haunt the Government. I do not think parts of it will stand up legally. I will leave it at that given the limitation on time and the fact that other Deputies want to come in.</p>

        <speech by="#JenniferWhitmore" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T21:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1517">As someone who has worked in the environmental sector for 20 years, I find tonight's debate quite concerning. Due to the Government's approach to many of these things, we are seeing a divide between rural and urban communities really come to the fore. The reality is that if we do not address climate change and deal with all the issues that are coming down the road, those in rural areas will be most impacted by the effects of climate change. We will see the cost of food increase. Flooding will increase and farmers will have grave difficulties dealing with the change in temperatures and environmental conditions. Where I do agree with the Deputies is that I believe this is because the Government's policy is leaving a lot of people behind. We have heard about how rural communities in particular are finding it very difficult with the cost of energy and fuel at the moment. It is within the remit of the Government to use taxation policy to assist those households and do something that is proactive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1518"> In the majority of instances when we discuss VAT issues with the Minister, he says it is not within the Government's competency and that it is within the control of the EU. This year, the EU brought in a directive, No. 2022/542, which will enable the Government to reduce the VAT on certain products to zero because they are in line with the EU Green Deal. I am asking the Minister to support rural communities and urban communities and the million households across this country whose homes are eligible and suitable for solar panels. He can support them by bringing in a zero VAT rate for solar installation and solar panels. This is absolutely within the Government's remit and it is something it could do very quickly. It would represent a greening of the VAT and would go a long way towards assisting those households that are suffering from the global energy shocks we are seeing. It would also help our country meet its emissions targets and help with the vulnerabilities of our grid. It is a win-win-win situation. Currently, when people buy solar panels, the Government gives them quite a meagre grant of a maximum of €2,400 but that money is taken back off them in VAT. We are asking that the Government not do that any longer and assist families to install solar panels, make their homes resilient against these energy shocks and help them reduce their energy bills by 40%. I have an amendment on this issue but we are not going to get to it. I ask that the Minister look into this. This is now allowable under EU rules. I ask that the Government be proactive and help families all across the country deal with their energy bills for next winter.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiOmurchu" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-11-23T21:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1519">We are obviously dealing with a circumstance of astronomical prices, whether we are talking about diesel, petrol or home heating oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">I do not think it makes any sense whatsoever to add to that. As has been said by many, the Government is leaving people behind and there is no logic to that. The only logic in regard to carbon tax was from the point of view of pushing people in a particular direction. The alternatives were not always there, but that has happened naturally in a dramatic way and I do not think there is any argument regarding carbon tax. </p>
          <p eId="para_1521"> Due to the guillotine, I am disappointed that I will not be able to deal with amendment No. 69, which seeks that the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, be considered as a means of providing mitigation to those people who are in gas fed communal district heating systems and are currently paying astronomical mortgage level bills. I have spoken to the Minister and others about the real solution that is needed, namely, changing how the heat is produced and moving away from gas to woodchip, geothermal or whatever. That will involve grants schemes and a huge amount of capital expenditure. There are ways to do that and communities like Carlinn Hall are considering those solutions. However, in the short term we need mitigations and TBESS payments could be given to companies in residential areas. The likes of Frontline Energy would be paid, but the money would be ring-fenced and provided as mitigation in bills to residents who are under astronomical pressure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1522"> This issue has been spoken about by many others, and whether it is dealt with here and now or at a later stage the fact is it needs to be dealt with as soon as possible by the Government. We need a long-term solution and a short-term solution, and I believe that now is the time to address that. The TBESS could be the means of doing that. I beseech the Minister to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1523">The Government has recognised the pressures families are under. I heard Deputy Michael Healy-Rae talk about the need for politicians in here to be servants of the people. I serve the people. It is equally important to be honest with the people and make the case for what we can afford to do and the level of challenge and risk we could face in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524"> We brought forward €4 billion worth of additional measures from the start of October until the end of February. I remember the budgets in 2016 and 2017, which were of an overall value of €3.6 billion for the year. The temporary measures we have brought forward are equivalent to the entire budgets the Deputy voted on a number of years ago. Those measures have been brought forward in recognition of the huge challenges that we appreciate families are facing. </p>
          <p eId="para_1525"> Deputy Healy-Rae made reference to the cost of fuel. He did not make reference to the fact that we cut excise on fuel, diesel and petrol. He made reference to gas and electricity, but did not refer to the fact that we cut VAT. He made reference to carbon tax, but did not refer to the fact that the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy, has been reduced for the next number of months to offset the impact of higher carbon taxes. We appreciate and understand the impact higher energy pricing is having on families and businesses. That is why we have reduced the taxes that make the biggest impact on the price of energy. That is why we have TBESS in place, which will be open over the coming days. All of these measures are in place until next February at a cost, as I said, of more than €4 billion of the country's money.</p>
