          <p eId="para_45">I refer to two matters on the Order of Business which have some relevance to the debate on the Ryan commission report.  Has the Government decided to give priority to legislation required concerning the usage of soft information to protect children at risk of abuse?  The Oireachtas joint committee report published in September recommended the Bill be published before Christmas.  It is currently on the C list and there is no timeframe for when it will be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The second issue relates to the report on the Monageer tragedy.  The Government indicated it was considering a mechanism to facilitate the publication of those sections of the report euphemistically referred to as "having been redacted", but which were in fact censored, including seven recommendations contained in it.  Members have no means of knowing whether those seven recommendations are, for example, in some way replicated in the Ryan commission report.  We should have access to that information before we start the debate on the Ryan commission report.  What does the Government intend to do with regard to bringing the Monageer report before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children so that the censored portions of it are accessible to Members?</p>

If we are to learn from the report, we need to know what was contained in the recommendations.  It is extraordinary that a report was published with some seven of the recommendations blacked out with the result that nobody could learn from them.  It is vital that a mechanism is found to have them put into the public arena.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is the appropriate mechanism for that.  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that happens as quickly as possible.</p>

Both Deputies have indicated their willingness to try to overcome the issue so as to enable the Oireachtas committee to be more fully informed of the issues currently redacted.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I formally welcome Deputies George Lee and Maureen O'Sullivan to the Dáil Chamber and wish them enjoyment and success as they represent their constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">On Friday last, Irish people voted for a fresh start.  They ended the domination of Irish politics by the Taoiseach's party for the first time in many years and made the Fine Gael Party the largest party in all three sets of elections.  Almost three quarters of them voted no confidence in the Government which is the reason we have a motion of no confidence before the Dáil today.  Friday was the first opportunity people had to cast their vote and give their verdict on the performance of this Government, which has crash-landed our economy.  Ireland's credit rating is again diminished, business is cash starved and in excess of 400,000 people are on the live register yet the Taoiseach continues to insist that the people's verdict does not matter, the elections were irrelevant and he will ignore the voice of the people by continuing on the disastrous path he has chosen.  He may be listening but he is certainly not hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">I put it to the Taoiseach that if he has any respect for the Irish people, who he leads politically, he will accept that following Friday's disaster for his Government, including his Green Party colleagues, he has no mandate or authority to continue in government and that he and his colleagues are deluding themselves if they believe they are losing support because they have faced tough decisions.  Across Europe, Governments which have faced tough decisions and made decisions in the interests of their respective populations from a fairness and equality point of view — those of Germany, France, Italy and Poland — have done well.  The truth is that the Government has lost the confidence of the people not because it faced tough decisions but because it made the wrong choices. If the Taoiseach really believes there is public support for what he is doing, I challenge him now on the floor of the House to spare his colleagues the humiliation of having to walk up those steps against the wishes of the Irish people expressed in their sovereign way through the secrecy and the power of the ballot box.  The Taoiseach still has the authority to seek a dissolution of the Dáil and ask the people to give a verdict on the plans that are put before them so that we can have a Government that can lead with authority, decisiveness and fairness and get on with sorting out the problems of the country.  If the Taoiseach believes now that he has the confidence of the people, I challenge him to put his programme to the test, dissolve the Dáil, let us have an election, let the people decide who they want and let the best horse jump that fence.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Deputy Kenny will be aware that under the Constitution my mandate is the one I received from this House 12 months ago.  It is a great privilege to have it.  I will use it, with the authority of that office and those with whom I am in Government, to continue with policies which we believe are, and which are becoming accepted across Europe as being, the policies necessary for this country.  The policies are ones that are approved by the European Commission in its job dealing with the euro area currency, our own ESRI and others who confirm that we are heading in the right direction.  I know that these policies have imposed hardships on our people.  I know there has been uncertainty.  Of course we worry about the increasing joblessness.  However, we also know that the level of adjustment, which has been significant this year, must continue next year and the year after, and that this Government, and the parties and the people who support this Government in this House, have been prepared to take those decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The Deputy has been continuing with this rather disingenuous argument that I do not have a mandate.  I have the very same mandate as the Taoiseach under which he served and that mandate was of the same quality of any other Taoiseach who had the privilege to serve his country from this position.  Of course it is a pretty predictable political attempt — rather clumsy, I would have thought, since it seeks to disregard the constitutional proprieties.  This House will have the opportunity this week to decide whether the majority has confidence in this Government or not, and that will be the democratic decision of this Assembly.  That is the means, under the Constitution, by which we hold or do not hold elections.  When we complete our mandate, which we received in 2007 and which we intend to complete in 2012, we will of course go to the people on the issue of the day then, which will be whether to elect this Government or any other.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">What was decided upon on Friday last was the election of people to the local authorities and to the European Parliament.  I congratulate those who were successful and commiserate with those who were defeated.  It was a democratic contest.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">The Government in which I was honoured to serve under former Taoiseach John Bruton dealt with our economic circumstances in a very different way from Deputy Cowen.  That Government handed the economy over to the incoming party in surplus and in good stead, and the Taoiseach has squandered that to a point where there is an unprecedented national debt, where unemployment has doubled in the past 12 months and where, not only in my view but in the people's view, the Taoiseach now has no mandate and no authority to continue in office.  Any other Government in Europe would have resigned in disgrace after the extent of defeat inflicted on this Government, not by the Parliament but by the people, on Friday last.  The facts speak for themselves.  The Taoiseach may well argue about the decision of the people but he cannot argue with the decision of the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in welcoming Deputies George Lee and Maureen O'Sullivan to the House and wish them well for their time here.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Last Friday something happened that I never thought I would see in this country.  The number of people out of work exceeded 400,000 for the first time ever.  Those people have paid for the Government's mistakes with their jobs.  The people who are still at work are paying for the Government's mistakes in the form of levies and additional taxes on their incomes.  The pensioners who had to give back their medical cards are paying for the Government's mistakes.  Children with special needs in schools who do not have the additional teachers and resources they need are paying for these mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">In that context, it is not surprising that last Friday the people of this country gave the most emphatic rejection of a sitting Government that has ever been given in this State.  Since then, we have had a succession of Ministers and, today, the Taoiseach telling us the verdict of the people does not matter and that the Government intends to limp on, run to the bunker and hope to recover for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The Taoiseach said this approach shows that the Government is acting courageously.  It is anything but.  The Government is displaying its fright and terror of facing the people in a general election.  This Government has lost its mandate, its moral authority to govern, the consent of the governed — on which any democratic government depends — and the confidence of the people.  How can a Government which has lost the confidence of the people continue in office?</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Let us start at the beginning.  Does the Taoiseach accept the Government was rejected by the people last Friday?  Does he accept that last Friday, the overwhelming majority of people who went out to vote voted against the Government?  Will he accept that verdict or will he rely, as appears to be the case, on his claim that a majority of Members of the House will vote with him in a motion of confidence?</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I suggest that majority is now redundant, because it is based on a vote cast two years ago which would not be replicated today.  The Government does not have the essential support of the people.  I do not refer here to temporary popularity, approval ratings or opinion polls, which will always go up and down for any Government.  I refer to a pattern which has existed for some months now, has been reflected in opinion polls and was confirmed overwhelmingly last Friday in a real election.  The Government does not now have the support, confidence or mandate of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">For the Government to continue in office is to defy the will of the people.  I repeat the request made by Deputy Kenny, that is, before we debate a motion of confidence on the Government in the House, the Taoiseach should do the decent, honourable and democratic thing, which is to respect the wishes and will of the people.  He should announce to this House his intention to resign from Government, go to Áras an Úachtaráin, seek a dissolution of the Dáil and let us have a general election so the people of the country — not the Members of this House who were elected two years ago in entirely different economic and political circumstances — can decide who should be governing this country in the difficult years ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">If Deputy Gilmore's premise was logical we would have had a general election after the local elections in 1985, and likewise in 1991.  In every local election, except probably in 1967, the Government of the day did not win and its parties returned with less representation in local authorities.  The same is true of the European Parliament elections since 1979 when we began to directly elect European parliamentarians.  If Deputy Gilmore's logic was correct, that would not have been the case and we would have had a different Government every two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The mandate received by this Government, as with any Government formed after a general election, is for a five-year period.  The reason we have a mandate for five years is to enable Governments to get on with taking the necessary decisions that have to be taken.  I am prepared to put my political reputation on the line at the end of that mandate in 2012, having had the opportunity to exercise our authority as a Government for the completion of that mandate and to do what is necessary for the country to bring us from an unprecedentedly difficult and swift change of economic fortunes that has come about for many reasons — not one reason — which we can debate in the House today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">We hear, listen and accept unreservedly the decisions of the people last Friday on who would be their representatives in local authorities and the European Parliament.  As a democrat I accept that, and I also accept that the mandate of the Government runs until 2012 and that we must get on with the job because the people have seen the electoral contest and the campaigns that have taken place and have heard the political talk, left, right and centre, throughout the country.  What we have to do now is get on with the job of government.  As long as the Government has a majority in this House to conduct the policies it puts forward and enacts, everyone who is a democrat must accept that is the position, according to the Constitution of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">When the mandate runs out in 2012 I will put the case for the Government to the people.  We will all put the case for the Government based on its performance over that period.  In the meantime, people expect us to get on with the job and that is what we are going to do.  We will have a debate in this House on an ongoing basis on the real policy choices or, if a coherent alternative is being put forward, of which there is no sign, we could have a debate on that as well.  In the meantime, we will continue to do what we believe to be right by the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">I accept the election outcome has had political implications for my party and for my colleagues in Government.  We accept the verdict of the people on the local authority and European Parliament elections.  We will now get on with the business of Government.  That is our job and that is what we will do.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">This Government is intent on ensuring it discharges its mandate as the elected Government of this country which is, as I stated, facing an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.  With the authority of this House, this Administration, under my leadership, has had to make adjustments during the past 12 months.  Tomorrow, the House will decide whether this Government will continue to enjoy the confidence of the House.  I am confident that the outcome of this debate will be that it does enjoy that confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">As I stated earlier on Leaders' Questions, I find it particularly disingenuous and not very democratic for people in this House to suggest that the Government does not have valid authority.  For so long as there is a majority in this House who support it, the Government has valid authority, as in the case of any other Government.  We acknowledge that the policies we have had to pursue are not immediately popular.  They are policies that require us to raise taxes and to make savings in expenditure.  The reason we do this is the collapse in tax revenues during the past financial year with expenditure, including capital expenditure, amounting to more than €60 billion and tax revenues amounting to only €40 billion.  Clearly, that is not a sustainable public finance position.  A Government would be in dereliction of its duty were it not to take whatever measures are necessary to bring about a sustainable path for our public finances.  We do that not because we are aligned to any particular economic ideological philosophy but because it is fundamental to the recovery of this country.  The one lesson of our economic history, if we are not to repeat the 1980s experience, is not to postpone those decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The Opposition has opposed the proposals we have brought forward, whether in relation to tax or expenditure, by way of the four or five major initiatives brought forward since taking office last May when it became clear after the first six months' Exchequer returns that we had to make certain adjustments.  If people continue to oppose in every respect, although they suggest in principle that they agree with the overall view that we must return our public finances to order, then they are opposing the prospect of sustainability of our public finances.  They are postponing and prolonging the prospect of recovery by reason of their political actions here.  If, as we all accept, the seriousness of our situation is such that we must bring forward such proposals then people who do not agree with the specific proposals outlined must come forward with alternatives that make up the figures in some other way.  Everyone is entitled, be it individually or by way of independent party grouping, to put their overall position and case to this House in respect of every economic debate in this House.  However, while on the one hand Fine Gael is suggesting we should be spending less, the Labour Party is, on the other, suggesting that we should be spending more.  At the end of the day, we have brought forward a plan.  We have brought forward proposals as to how we are going to get out of this problem.  This year alone, the Government, with all of the impact it has in terms of political support in the country for obvious reasons, has made an adjustment of more than €8 billion, an almost 5% correction in GNP terms in this first year of correction of our public finances.  That is a greater level of adjustment than any other Government in the euro area with similar problems, or, in the case of Spain, problems worse than ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I acknowledge and accept that the national indebtedness of the country will rise from a low of 20% owing to the prudent policies pursued in different times and different circumstances with record investment in education, health and social welfare rates, and quite properly so.  We looked after pensioners and surpassed the €200 per week limit we set ourselves in previous Administrations.  While we did all that, we also halved the national debt and brought our GNP debt ratio to 20%.  That is rising now to 41% this year and will rise to 59% next year.  Deputy Kenny has suggested the economy is going down the toilet <i>in toto</i>.  He is suggesting that is a level of indebtedness that is simply out of kilter with everybody else.  We will still be the third lowest——</p>

          <p eId="para_247">What I am saying is that the indebtedness of this country will continue to be third lowest in the euro area even after next year.  That is not to suggest that there is any great comfort in that.  I am simply making the point that when revenues are reduced to such an extent, so dramatically and quickly, a correction and an adjustment must be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">We have to make a correction and an adjustment.  We have not only set out an €8 billion adjustment for this year which, as I have noted, is the most significant of any in the euro area in terms of percentage of GNP but next year will see a further adjustment of €4 billion.  An adjustment of €4 billion will also have to be made in the following year.  We have put those plans to the European Commission and they have been accepted.  They have also been accepted by ECOFIN and other Finance Ministers, the Central Bank and independent domestic commentators as the best way forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">It has also been accepted by the social partners as the way forward.  Deputy Quinn clearly has something to say about that but the framework agreed at the end of January gets the agreement of social partnership on the need to make this adjustment to our public finance position as a prerequisite to economic recovery.  If the Deputy has a problem with that point, he is at variance with the facts.  The policies being pursued are the policies which have to be proceeded with because they are the means by which we will reduce expenditure, raise some taxation and continue to find cuts in our public capital programme, which will be less in volume terms although similar in output terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The country can return to growth and we are seeking to build international confidence in our approach to ensure that, as a small open economy, we can continue to borrow and trade during this unprecedented period of international turbulence.  In April's supplementary budget, the Government outlined a programme for restoring stability to the public finances for the period until 2013.  That has set a clear pathway to a general Government deficit of below 3% by 2013 through a combination of taxation increases and expenditure reductions over that period.  We have made a significant start while outlining how we will achieve further adjustments of $4 billion in 2009 and 2010.  The greater part of the adjustment will be borne by expenditure reductions and informed by the ongoing work of the special group in public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  The Commission on Taxation, which is to report in July, will inform Government choices and considerations on how we redesign our tax system for a sustainable way forward in terms of revenues which match the expenditure programmes we put in place.  The Government's approach has struck a careful balance between international credibility in Ireland's fiscal position and borrowing to maximise economic activity in the short-term.  Our strategy has been broadly endorsed by independent commentators at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The issue that has dominated economic debate in recent times has been the banking system.  The Government's approach to the unprecedented crisis has been structured and considered.  It is clear that we have to deal with this situation as we have been dealing with it.  We sought advice and counsel from qualified sources and have at all times tried to protect depositors in Irish banks, the Irish financial system and Irish taxpayers.  We sought to ensure the flow of credit, which is vital to the real economy.  We have acted decisively to guarantee until September 2010 the liabilities of relevant institutions in order to ensure banks could maintain their normal liquidity positions in interbank lending and debt markets.  The Minister for Finance, as part of the supplementary budget, has announced his intention to bring the guarantee into line with the way guarantees have evolved throughout Europe.  The vast majority of guarantee schemes introduced by other EU states covered debt instruments with longer maturity terms of up to five years.  We intend to introduce a scheme for a guarantee by the Minister of eligible debt securities with a maximum maturity of five years.  That scheme will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">We have also seen the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  In order to strengthen the funding position of Irish banks and ensure the flow of credit to the real economy, the Government is conscious of the need to address the issue of impaired assets, in particular, specific asset classes currently perceived as carrying a higher than average risk in an Irish context which generally involve lending for land and property development.  Strengthening the banks' balance sheets will considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and, as a consequence, ensure the flow of credit on a  commercial basis to the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">On the major issue of creating financial stability as a prerequisite for economic growth and ensuring that our public finances are brought into balance over the period until 2013, it is interesting to note that external observers are commenting favourably on the direction of Government policy.  It seems in this House, however, that no credit is to be given to the Government.  If that is part of the political game playing that takes place, that is fine and we can continue to debate it in these terms.  However, the fact of the matter is that the macro-economic adjustment we are undertaking has been significant in its first year, is greater than that of any other Government in Europe and will continue on the basis of the plans which have been approved by the European Commission.  Devising a mechanism like NAMA as a means of restoring confidence in our banking system is a precondition to restoring real economic growth as the external environment improves.  That is something the Government defends and is a reason why one should maintain confidence in this Administration.  The plan is in place and we have made it clear that we will proceed with whatever decisions are necessary to achieve the targets we have set in regard to it.  This is the only way we can maintain credibility externally in the policies being implemented by the Government as a means of returning to a sustainable path in the future and the only way we can bring growth back to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">There has been much talk about jobs, and rightly so.  Many people are losing their jobs in this economy.  Thankfully, even in the present circumstances 1.8 million people are working as we speak.  The unfortunate reality this year is that employment will decrease for the first time in many years in terms of total numbers employed but it is also important to say that in historic terms many more people are working now compared to five, ten or 15 years ago because of the level of economic activity we are generating even in these recessionary times.  The numbers on the live register, which have unfortunately increased to 11.8% according to last Friday's figures, are clearly a matter for concern.  The only way we can return jobs to our economy is by restoring growth.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The only way we can restore growth is by making sure we continue with the public finance position outlined by the Minister for Finance in the supplementary budget.  During the course of this debate there will be opportunities for Members who support or are in Government or are in Opposition to discuss the real choices.  Whatever the choices people may wish to promulgate, they will have to be discussed on the basis that we will continue to ensure our public position improves, as has been outlined to and agreed by those with whom we work in the euro area.  Any debate outside those parameters will not be real or honest because the only statement we can make frankly to the people is that if we spend €60 billion and take in €40 billion, we have to change the dynamic.  The way of changing the dynamic is through restoring growth.  During the course of this evening and tomorrow, we will outline in detail the Government's plans to achieve that end in the various economic and social areas for which Ministers have responsibility.  Ultimately, the confidence that can be placed in this Government will be on the basis of our preparedness to take decisions which bring short-term unpopularity but which, when we complete our mandate and growth is restored and jobs returned to the Irish economy, will cause people to look back at 2009 and 2010 and acknowledge that a Government was in place which was prepared to take decisions in the immediate term to make the adjustments which gave our economy and people the prospect of growth and jobs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_261">That reminds me of the round of applause received by the Minister for Finance when he introduced one of the most disastrous budgets of all time.  A Government can only govern with the permission of the people and can only continue if it has their confidence.  This Government of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and a scattering of Independent Deputies was rejected by almost three quarters of the people last Friday.  From that perspective, the Government has no mandate or authority to continue to govern because the people have rejected it.  We, as Members of the national Parliament, have a duty to listen and respond to the clear verdict of the people; that is why the motion is before the House in the first place.  Motions of confidence and motions of no confidence are not everyday issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Almost three quarters of the Irish people, by their decision last Friday, cast a verdict of no confidence in the Taoiseach and his Government to sort out the problems of the country.  It was an historic day in many ways because it broke the dominance of the Fianna Fáil Party in Irish politics for the first time in 77 years and made this party, which I have the honour to lead, the largest party in all three elections.  The voters responded to a call that we have been making for quite some time.  In the streets and homes of Ireland people want change; they are fed up with a Government that has neither listened nor led and which has not been able to deal with the problems that the country now faces.  From that perspective, they have given a vote of confidence to the one party that has put forward a series of progressive proposals that will deal in so many ways——</p>

Minister after Minister will stand up and state we have nothing to offer only negative opinions.  However, they do not listen because they do not want to read and hear what are good proposals from an Opposition party.  The ethos of Fianna Fáil people in Government means they are unable to bring themselves to accept a good proposal from anybody else other than from the heart of their own party.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I feel very differently from the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and by listening to the people I know what they are talking about.  In every town from Castletownbere to Donegal and Wexford and throughout the cities they have the same predisposition; they want change and by that they mean a change of Government.  This is why I say today that if Members have the courage of their convictions — if they have the courage to say they have confidence that the people support them — they would put their case.</p>

That should be a Fine Gael Government, which would create a fairer society, bear in mind what social justice is, develop an ability to deal with waste and tackle these problems in a fair and progressive way that the people would understand, unlike the mayhem caused by Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I note that today, an economic rating agency stated it may well be that an election is needed to give a new Government some moral authority; one does not have to accept the words of those abroad — the Taoiseach never does — but it is an observation.  Ministers hide behind the ESRI report and state that it said we were on the right track.  They do not read the full report where it is stated clearly that if the economic policies which were followed had not been followed we would be in a far better position than we are.</p>

Day after day and hour after hour, silently and by stealth, jobs continue to be lost.  There is no faith, trust or confidence in the Government to deal with it.  This means that we must deal with the way the Government is run, the cost of governance and the way our governance systems have operated.  We need radical change and a radical overhaul to the way it is done.

We now know that there was such a run.  We now know that other very serious issues arose that were not discussed in this House at that time.  Proceeding with the setting up of the National Asset Management Agency, on the advice of one consultant, may well expose the Irish taxpayer irretrievably to a further potential debt of €90 billion, with dubious assessments of those valuations, for which their grandchildren will still be paying, when we could do it in so many other ways.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">People have had overdrafts reduced from €20,000 to €3,000.  People looking for short extensions on credit facilities cannot get them.  Local bank managers are no longer entitled to make decisions and the decisions being made higher up the line are often by people who, with respect to them, have not created a job at any time in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">It appears as if this Government will continue its relationship with big utility companies, regulators and senior public servants.  The work of Government has been stymied by key network infrastructures in areas like telecommunications, energy and water, which is undermining our environment and our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Many public servants across the country have told me they would like to see this system reformed.  As a public servant I believe that public servants should be able to go home in the evening happy in the knowledge that they have done a good day's work in the interest of progressing our country, but the current system strangles the initiative of many people who have creativity and ingenuity to offer our public service.  The Taoiseach has done nothing about that, and it causes serious frustration among hundreds of thousands of our public servants.  I am aware of the problem we face in dealing with our public finances.  That is an issue that must be faced.  We must debate the various forms in which we can deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Deputy Simon Coveney produced a proposal for Fine Gael called NewERA, an €11 billion financial stimulus for the creation of 100,000 jobs.

When I hear Ministers saying the Fine Gael Party does not have any constructive ideas to suggest, I put forward that proposal as one the Government has not even considered because it does not consider proposals that come from other parties.  I have made the point that the Taoiseach is afraid to consider any form of tax breaks to make it easier for small business to survive the recession and to get people back to work.  The Tánaiste should know that intimately because businesses are talking to her on a regular basis.  They are strangled because the stimulus does not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We have suggested reducing the top and lower VAT levels.  We have suggested the abolition of PRSI for new employees.  We have suggested subsidised employment in cases where employers take on young employees to get confidence back into the economy and to encourage people to start spending money.  We have made those suggestions but they have all been rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Taoiseach's Government wants to continue the centralised command and control two tier system in the health area.  Deputy James Reilly has put forward what is a revolutionary and radical proposal to overhaul our health system.  It is not hypothetical.  It is not fantasy.  It works in other countries.</p>

It is a two tier system that is not patient centred and has gone down the road of building private hospitals on public lands.  We know from our analysis of what we can bring in each year that those savings would be better put back into the front-line services of nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and so on, but the Taoiseach will not even consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I was in Cabra one morning recently with Deputy Brian Hayes when two women approached me to say that two days previously a 92 year old woman had fallen on the street.  She lay on the footpath for 45 minutes before an ambulance arrived.  Medics had to strip the woman on the pavement to attend to her bruises and other injuries.  That is not the kind of system over which Deputy Brian Cowen should stand.  That is not the kind of system the people of the country want.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">I am concerned, however, that arising from the vote of no confidence by the people last Friday that the Taoiseach now faces a serious problem in attempting to lead our country to a point where its people will vindicate that in which we believe in terms of the Lisbon referendum and pass it.  I am glad Mr. Ganley took up my challenge of standing in Ireland north west.  I am glad that he had the truthfulness to say he is now finished with politics and that, like the organisation he started under many different guises, he will not be playing a part in that referendum campaign.  I am concerned, however, that we have not gone about this process in the way we should.  It is almost six months since we met.  I would like to have had a constant stream of information on the Government proposals to deal with Lisbon and the sequential dealing with many of the issues that are important for our country and its future.  In terms of credibility and authority, moral and governmental, the Taoiseach faces a serious problem arising from the decision of the people last Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I have spoken in this House on a number of motions of confidence and no confidence over the years.  Every Deputy, including Deputy Gogarty, should consider the verdict of the people last Friday.

          <p eId="para_340">One of the greatest privileges and honours in any democracy is the privilege of being elected to one's national Parliament.  It is an honour every Member of the House has had, sometimes on successive occasions.  It is an honour and a privilege shared today by Deputies Lee and O'Sullivan who have joined the House.  Each of us as a Member of Dáil Éireann is elected to represent our constituents.  It does not always mean that we must follow every trend in public opinion.  There are occasions when we must take positions as legislators which are not always the popular positions.  However, I believe we have a duty as Members of the House to reflect generally the will and wish of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Like Deputy Kenny I have been here for a number of motions of confidence.  These are proposed from time to time when a Government or its members misbehave or when there is some major political event.  One thing that has always characterised any motion of confidence in my time here has been the belief, or lack of belief as the case may be, on both sides of the House that the Government enjoyed the confidence of the public and that whatever decision might be made here, if it were put to the test outside, the Government would win.  That has always been the Government's principled defence.  However, that defence does not apply today.  The one thing we know as we debate the motion of confidence is that if the Government were to take its case to the people today, it would be defeated.  The motion of confidence in Dáil Éireann comes days after the people have voted no confidence in the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">When the Taoiseach calls on the members of the Government parties and the independents who support the Government to vote confidence in it, he is asking them to do something which flies in the face of what the people seek.  The Taoiseach stated that this is the constitutional position.  It may indeed be a very literal reading of the Constitution, but I do not believe that it is in the spirit of the Constitution, which does not provide for fixed term elections of the Dáil.  It provides for a dissolution which a Taoiseach may exercise from time to time and he may seek a dissolution of the Dáil in any range of circumstances.  I believe this is one of the circumstances anticipated by those who framed our Constitution.  Where a Government had lost the confidence of the people and where there is no longer a sufficient mandate or authority from the people for the Government to continue, then the honourable thing for the head of the Government to do in such circumstances is to resign, seek a dissolution of the Dáil and ask the people whether that Government or combination of parties should continue or be replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The Taoiseach stated in his defence that the reason the people voted no confidence in the Government last Friday is because it made hard choices.  That is not the case.  The reason the people voted is that the Government made the wrong choices over a period and, I suggest, provided bad leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Since the Taoiseach had held office he has led the defeat of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, although he had the support of the two main Opposition parties.  He introduced a blanket guarantee for the banking system last September, a bad decision which has exposed the taxpayer to continued difficulties in the years ahead.  Instead of dealing fairly with the problems in the public finances, he introduced taxes and, instead of being honest with people, called them income levies.  These levies hit people on lower incomes most severely.  The Taoiseach targeted disadvantaged and special needs children for education cuts.  He abolished grants for children at risk of leaving school early and the grants available for Traveller children.  He axed special needs classes for children with learning disabilities.  He took away the book grant from disadvantaged children and increased class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Taoiseach decided not to proceed with the cervical cancer vaccine which would have cost only €16 million.  He scrapped medical cards for the over 70s, only to be forced to reintroduce them for some over 70s.  He introduced an increase in VAT which has decimated trade and which has caused significant problems for business.  Although not yet established in legislation, he proposes to establish NAMA or an bord bail-out, instead of dealing more effectively with the banking system.  He got rid of the Christmas bonus, something valued by old age pensioners.  I could go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">It is not simply that the Taoiseach made the wrong choices over the course of the past year.  On every issue he acted too late.  This time last year the Opposition parties told him there was an economic problem.  We told him people were losing their jobs, that businesses were having difficulty getting credit from the banks and he would not listen.  Yet, the Taoiseach denied that there was an economic problem.  As a result and because he delayed dealing with it he made the problem worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The reason people have no confidence in the Taoiseach is not simply because of the decisions made in the course of the past year, or that he did not see the problems when they were staring everyone else in the face, it is because the Taoiseach and the Government got us into the hole in the first place.  It was the policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Governments, especially that presided over by the Taoiseach in his capacity as Minister for Finance at the time, which have added to the effects of the global economic downturn, from which we would have been affected in any event, and which have made the problem worse in this country.  It was the way in which the Taoiseach and his predecessor in the Department of Finance, Mr. McCreevy, operated.  Instead of dealing with the downturn in export activity, he blew additional air into the property bubble and created the unsustainable level of construction activity.  The then Government tax incentivised it and continued to inflate the bubble instead of letting it down slowly.  This is what has created and given rise to the economic difficulties in which the country finds itself today.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Taoiseach in his defence points at us and argues that there are differences in policy between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  That is the case and we will honestly address those differences.  However, the real problem is not the policy differences on the Opposition benches but that Government policy continues to change from month to month and sometimes from week to week.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">As we debate the motion we must reflect the wishes of the people.  While campaigning during the local elections, European elections and the bye-elections, I discovered and found very heartening a very strong sense of determination among people that we can get through the recession.  There was a strong sense from business people about their difficulties, such as customers not coming through the door, the difficulties in getting credit from the banks, the way in which they would like to keep their employees, but also their determination to stay in business, survive the recession and to get to the other side.  The second consideration is the concern of people right across the country not just for themselves in immediate terms, but also for their children and the future of this country.  Over and over again, I heard people saying: "We don't mind paying a bit extra, provided we know where it is going and provided we know what is being done with it."  They say they are not prepared to accept that they have to pay disproportionately or unfairly or that in the case of those who were the great beneficiaries of the Celtic tiger years — those who benefited from the property speculation that took place — no action is being taken to get them to make their contribution now.  There is a will among people to put their shoulder to the wheel, to move the country forward and restore the economy, to recover our fortunes and to get confidence back in the country again.  There is also a wish among people that the international respect, which this country, our financial institutions and our economy once had, would be restored.  However, in order for that to happen, there has to be a fresh start and that begins with a change of Government.  In my view, the Taoiseach is doing a great disservice to the country by insisting on staying in office in circumstances where the people of the country want him out of office and where the country needs a new Government with a fresh mandate and a fresh start.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">We all understand that difficult decisions have to be made in the years ahead and there is work to be done.  For example, we have to get our banks operating again and get credit moving to business.  The Taoiseach's Government and my party have differing views on this and those differing views go back to the night of 30 September 2008 when he brought in the bank guarantee scheme.  We regarded this as the wrong way to go.  Our view was that this was providing a blanket, unconditional safety net for the banks at the expense of the taxpayer and, as time has progressed, we have been proven right.  The Taoiseach was the person who came into the House that night and told us we were wrong.  He told us that if the guarantee scheme was introduced it would not cost the taxpayer anything, that there would not have to be any money put into the banks.  He was wrong on that point because he has ended up repeatedly having to put forward money which, frankly, the country does not have in order to recapitalise banks.  This is just an endless continuation of money being put forward when the guarantee scheme is in place and the taxpayer has to bear liability for the entire banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">There is a better way, which is the way the Labour Party has argued and which is supported.  The Taoiseach referred today to the commentators who have commented favourably on the Government's actions with regard to the economy.  A total of 20 leading economists said that the approach recommended by the Labour Party is the right action with regard to the banks, which is their temporary nationalisation and the setting up of a banking commission, and the establishment of a national investment bank which would provide the funding needed for infrastructure.  That is a difference between us.  There is also the urgent need to get people back to work and to protect existing employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">In my view, the most significant figure to emerge from last Friday was not the number of votes cast for whatever party or the number of transfers that elected people late at night, but that we now have more than 400,000 people out of work in this country, and that number is rising.  This gives rise to two actions we need to take.  First, we need to stop the haemorrhage of jobs and get credit moving again to business and restore confidence in business so that employment can be created.  Second, we have to do something for the people who are losing their jobs. There has been a concentration in the entire dialogue about the economic difficulties of the country, the public finances and the billions for banks and so on, but we should instead talk about the needs of people, particularly those who have lost their jobs.  This is the reason the Labour Party has been arguing for some new active labour market measures which would provide some assistance to those people.  We have suggested that the opportunity of the recession should be used to provide people with the training and education they need in order to be better able to take up employment opportunities and to start businesses as the economy recovers.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The Taoiseach has taken up some of those ideas in name.  I refer to our idea of an earn and learn scheme, but the Taoiseach only provided 277 places.  The Labour Party suggested a graduate placement scheme which the Taoiseach nominally adopted, but only about 2,000 places are being provided.  The need is much greater than that and it would be a better use of public money to have people back in education and training, gaining experience in their relevant professions, rather than idle and on the dole.  Those are practical things that can be done.  A third action which needs to be taken is to have a fresh look at the national development plan and to reprioritise it in a way that brings forward the projects which will generate more employment.  The Labour Party has suggested that the programmes of school and hospital building and of much-needed community facilities could be accelerated, because this is an investment in our future and a way of getting people back to work in the short term.  If the Government can bring money forward to recapitalise the banks, then money can be brought forward to recapitalise the country, create employment and get the economy moving again and deal with people's real needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">We have talked about reforming the public service.  There has been a lot of abuse of the public service over the past year.  Some of it has been very vulgar abuse directed at public servants who do good work and are decent people who are paid modest rates.  This party believes in the delivery of good public services. We believe there are certain things that are best provided by public provision, such as education and health, the public infrastructure.  However, we also believe that we can get better value for money from the entire public services and this can be done by reforming the way they are being delivered and the way in which they are structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Labour Party has also argued that we should learn from what happened in this country such as the culture of crony capitalism and — with respect — over which the Taoiseach's party has presided for more than a decade.  We should at least learn the lessons from what has happened.  I refer to what happened in the banks and to the culture of "You sit on my board and I will sit on your board and somebody else will chair somebody else's board".  This is an old boys' network which operates hand in glove with each other and where people know what is moving and what is shaking and are able to take advantage of it.  That day is over, and it has to go.  This is the reason the Labour Party has proposed a range of reforms of corporate governance so that what has happened with our banks and to our economy over the past year or more will never happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">For all this to come to pass, we need political change.  We have a Government that has been in office for 12 years now with people who have been used to leaving the country on autopilot, who have been used to a culture where no matter what problem arose, there was always money that could be thrown at it and there was always another board or body that could be established to deal with it.  A Government of that kind is not in a position to take the kind of decisions needed to grab the country by the scruff of the neck and deal with the problems the country has to address, to provide the kind of leadership to decent people all over the country who want to make a fresh start, who have a sense of patriotism and want a better future for their children, not a return to the emigrant boat.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Deputy Kenny talked about some of the people he met during the course of the election campaign.  I want to tell the Taoiseach about a man I met in a shopping centre.  He told me he was a building worker and had worked on building sites all his life.  He was in his mid-50s and did not believe he would work again but that was not his problem.  He had educated two sons and had put them through college.  They were now engineers and his problem was that they would have to face the emigrant plane, as his brothers and sisters had to do in the 1950s and 1960s.  He could not understand why, when he had educated his children and made the sacrifices that enabled them to become professionals, they must now face the same economic fate that generations before them had to face.  He wants a future here for his children.  They want a future here.  That kind of future can only come when this country recovers its confidence, when we have got through the difficult times and have recovered the respect and trust we had abroad.  That can only come with a change of political leadership here.  The only people who can determine that are the people of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">We are elected to represent the people.  Each Deputy in the House has a choice to make tomorrow.  Even if in our hearts we believe there is confidence among the people in this Government, we are required to do more than come into the House, observe a party whip and vote for self-preservation as I believe some Members of the Government parties will do tomorrow.  Every Member of this House has a duty to reflect and respect the will and wishes of the people, which, as demonstrated last Friday in ballot papers and in repeated opinion polls, now demands that the Taoiseach's Government should stand down, make way, hold an election and let the people decide who should run our affairs for the years ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">The Sinn Féin Deputies will vote no confidence in the Government in the Dáil tomorrow.  The people clearly have no confidence in the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and have shown that by their overwhelming rejection of both parties in last Friday's local and European elections.  This is a disastrous Government and it has no mandate.  It has no political authority to govern and clearly has no confidence to do so.  The 400,000 unemployed people and their dependants demand that this Government should go.   The many thousands of workers whose incomes have been hit by pay cuts, short-term working and unfair levies demand that the Government should go.  People hit by savage cuts to public services to health and education demand that this Government should go.  The coalition of corrupt politicians, property developers and bankers brought this economy to its knees and they will not and cannot lead it into recovery.  They should all be turfed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">People have not punished the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government because a global recession has hit Ireland.  They have done so because they know the recession is worst in our country as a result of the disastrous policies pursued by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for more than a decade and the disastrous decisions made by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party over the past two years.  The programme for Government was negotiated by three parties, one of which, the Progressive Democrats, no longer exists although its former leader remains a key Minister.  The Green Party has been reduced to three seats in local government and Fianna Fáil suffered an unprecedented loss of 89 city and county council seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The former leader of the Green Party engaged in the charade of saying he would resign as leader rather than go into Government with Fianna Fáil.  He did resign, not in an effort to prevent or oppose such a coalition but to facilitate it and that is exactly what happened.  It was downhill all the way for the Green Party after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">This Government is totally out of touch with the people.  A couple of weeks before the election the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, claimed that social welfare rates in this State are,"far more generous than those in other countries".  He suggested they are a disincentive to work.  The suggestion is an insult to the tens of thousands of people dependent on social welfare who are struggling from week to week.  The Minister should try living on the jobseeker's allowance of €204.37 per week, or, better still, try living on the new €100 per week rate for unemployed people aged under 20 after the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government's savage cutback in the budget last April.  Thousands of people are joining the dole queues every month thanks to disastrous policies of this Government but instead of coming up with a real retention and job creation strategy the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, is preparing to cut social welfare on the spurious basis that unemployed people do not want to work because social welfare payments are so generous.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are to have more hardship inflicted on them to spur them on to find jobs that clearly do not now exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">This is a clear example of how totally discredited this Government is in its attacks on the living standards of low income families.  Some 400,000 people are on the dole queues but this Government has no strategy for the retention and creation of jobs.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has allowed jobs to bleed from this economy and has stood idly by.  The case of SR Technics is the classic example.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">Right-wing policies pursued by a right-wing Government ultimately killed off these jobs.  In the same way, in spite of the prosperity of the Celtic tiger years the telecommunications infrastructure in this State is substandard because right-wing policies pursued by a right-wing Government led to the privatisation of Eircom.  That was one of the greatest ever swindles of the public and we are all paying the price today.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The causes of the economic recession here and the reasons for the disastrous decisions of this Government are deep rooted.  Policies pursued by Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1997 have led us to where we are today.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, claimed today on radio that nobody in political life objected to the total dependence on the construction boom and the property bubble which was so clearly responsible for the depth of the recession in this State compared to other EU states.  The Minister of State's claim is completely false.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">His colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made a similar claim in April when he said, "Some did warn that the housing market was unsustainable.  Plenty did not".  We in Sinn Féin stand on our record in that regard.  In November 2003 at the Construction Industry Federation conference, the then Minister for Finance at the time, Charlie McCreevy, actually asked for advice on housing policy from the assembled developers and property speculators.  I stated at the time that the Government, in tandem with the same developers and property speculators, was directly responsible for the spiralling price of houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">It was at the behest of the Construction Industry Federation that the Government gutted section 5 of the Planning Act 2000, which required 20% of new developments to consist of social and affordable housing.  The housing policy of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Governments was totally market driven and as a result we had massive local authority waiting lists.  Even people on above average incomes could not afford a home.  Between 1998 and 2003, the price of a new house in the State rose on average by 177%.  In terms of policy, nothing has changed.  The recent budget slashed the funding for the provision of social housing by local authorities.  Clearly, the Government has learned nothing from the failures of the past decade and acknowledges no fault.  That is galling and infuriates many people throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">As well as mounting an assault on low to middle income earners, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government is imposing savage cuts on public services that will have extremely damaging long-term consequences.  Our public health services, already badly affected by cuts since autumn 2007, face nothing short of disaster, but the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, tries to maintain the fiction that she is maintaining services to patients while services are being reduced or removed altogether.  The Government has placed an embargo on the filling of almost all posts in the public health service.  In addition, it is expected that contracts for up to 14,000 workers in the health services will not be renewed.  This is a recipe for disaster in our public health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">HSE senior management has indicated it was not consulted prior to the Government's announcement of the embargo on 26 March, but it is required nevertheless to implement the decision.  The Irish Nurses Organisation and SIPTU have indicated to the HSE that it will not be possible to run the public health service in the context of the recruitment embargo as announced by Government.  Communities in Clare and north Tipperary have had 24-hour accident and emergency cover removed from the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh, placing the regional hospital in Limerick under enormous pressure.  Breast cancer services have also been removed from the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, placing Beaumont Hospital under more pressure.  Monaghan General Hospital is about to lose its last remaining acute hospital services.  Hospital services in Cork and Kerry are to be centralised in Cork city.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Waiting lists and accident and emergency queues are as bad as ever and will worsen with the massive cuts in jobs in the public health service.  Those nurses who have not been laid off now face a doubled income and health levy as well as the public services pension levy.  At the same time, the Minister has given a gold-plated guarantee to hospital consultants that their €250,000 per annum contract will not be touched.  This contract is for a 33-hour week in the public system and consultants can still work up to 25% of that time in private practice.  Even at that, hours are not properly monitored, leaving a question over time spent in and commitment to the public health system by some consultants.  They in turn tarnish the public's view of all practitioners at that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The Government has repeatedly claimed that one of the factors that made us an economic success story was a young, well educated workforce, but what has the Government done to education?  It has cut €30 million from the school building programme.  This comes on top of the education cuts already introduced, which hit the most vulnerable, such as children with special needs.  The cut in the school building is pure folly, not only in terms of education but of public spending and employment.  Children will continue to be taught in overcrowded and sub-standard classrooms.  There are 1,400 schools on the school building waiting list.  Some 100,000 additional pupils will enter primary school over the next decade, but the question remains as to where they will be accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">In the past three years, the Government has spent €113 million on the rental of school prefabs.  The Minister for Education and Science has projected a further spend of €48 million on prefabs for 2009.  The annual average cost to the Department for each prefab is €12,500.  Therefore, the cut in the school programme is bad for the public finances.  It will cost far more in the long run and will guarantee rental income to companies supplying prefabs but leave schools with deteriorating and, eventually, useless and worthless units.  These already exist in every constituency throughout the country.  The Government should increase and frontload the school building programme as part of a job creation strategy, as proposed by Sinn Féin in our comprehensive employment retention and creation document, Getting Ireland Back to Work.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I would like to speak about the situation in the Border counties.  One would have hoped that the Cabinet in recent years, which included — reflective of constituency returns — Deputies whose roots were in Border constituencies, would have demonstrated an understanding and a concentration on the needs of Border communities.  However, over the past 12 months we have witnessed businesses closing every week.  Lights are going out in businesses for the last time and people's hopes,  expectations and years of hard work and investment are lost to themselves, their families and their communities.  This story applies in all large and small towns along the Border, but there has been no move to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">We are all aware of the difficulties that arise when we have two currencies on the same island and of what variations in currency can do to the movement of people and the attraction to shop on either side.  However, the Government has not put any thought into a solution and there has been no engagement with the Northern Assembly representatives to explore with them, prior to exploration with the British Government, the potential that could be realised for the economies North and South of the Border by the introduction of a single currency, the euro, throughout the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">There has been no address of the benefits that could be gained by working towards tax harmonisation.  We have huge differentials currently, between a 15% VAT rate north of the Border and 21.5% south of the Border.  These issues must be addressed.  There is no point in saying they will not be discussed.  We must engage with civic society in order to build momentum for these essential changes.  They are not only essential to the Border counties, but to explore the economies of counties further south than the Border, where the exodus is also clearly in evidence over recent months.  This is in the interest of everyone and is not meant to arrest movement one way or the other.  This is a cycle.  People north of the Border are aware that while they currently face boom times in Border towns, in counties Derry, Fermanagh, Armagh and Down and parts of County Tyrone, they knew the other side of the coin not many months ago.  They know that will return.  How can people invest in business in the Border counties and how can they build on such uncertain foundations?  These are foundations of sand, where people have no control and no certainty for the future.  It is critical that the Government demonstrates an awareness of the acute difficulties that apply to establishing and sustaining business in the Border counties.  I commend these measures to the Tánaiste in an appeal to start the process of engagement.  She would be surprised to find people in business north of the Border, from very different political outlooks, who are open to discussion and exploration of these matters.  They know that, for all our sakes, there is no other way.  This is like the elephant in the room; everyone is ignoring it.  Yet, this is what must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">There is also the issue of the duplication of bureaucracies.  This ridiculous situation reflects itself time after time.  Competing agencies north and south of the Border operate on the international stage in competition for inward investment and in a raft of other areas.  We must work towards the creation of a common international presentation and commendation of the rewards that await inward investors on the island of Ireland, as we have done in the tourist field.  We must recognise that back-to-back delivery systems in health, education and public transport contribute to an imperfect situation in which people get poor return for their tax payments.  I urge the Government to look at the potential, which is realisable where there is political will.  I believe there is the political will to engage and explore among people of a wide range of political opinion north of the Border.  I have not seen a willingness to explore on this side of the Border.  That baffles me.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Government is bankrupt, not only in terms of Exchequer returns but in ideas and skills.  It is time for its members to pack up their bags and follow the Taoiseach out the back door.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I will not do so.  However, this is a little silver lining in what has been a very difficult and disappointing election.  I pay tribute to the men and women of my party, people of integrity and ability, who put themselves forward and many of whom were rejected.  They suffered because of a national situation and the worst recession in the history of the State and because the Government has had to take very unpopular decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I can understand the palpable anger among the public.  People have lost their jobs and are standing in dole queues.  Others see less money in their pay packets.  They find it extremely difficult to access credit from banks.  It is no wonder they are angry.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">On behalf of the Green Party, I ask the following question.  Could the Opposition do a better job?  We are faced with the prospect of a chalk and cheese coalition and an Opposition which believes one can make an omelette without cracking an egg.  I have not heard the alternative vision.  I have not heard Opposition Members spell out, in any detail, how they would make up the €20 billion deficit.  It is a monumental task for any Government.  Whichever coalition is in power — and it will be a coalition — will have to face the same difficult choices and make the same unpopular expenditure cuts.  If Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in Government they would have faced the wrath of the voters.  They would have had to face the same difficult choices.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">What I find most difficult to accept is that when the Government comes up with good ideas they are rejected.  Deputy Ó Caoláin is wrong when he says we are bankrupt of ideas.  We are not.  We have come up with good policy initiatives.  During the course of the election campaign these ideas were rejected once again.  We heard the usual litany of negativity.  The Opposition managed very well to tap into that negativity, hostility and anger.  It disappoints me when I see good ideas, such as the reform of local government and a directly elected mayor for Dublin, rejected.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">Our job in government is to take tough decisions to build a new and fairer country and we will continue to do it.  For two years, the current coalition has continued to adapt to the rapidly changing circumstances in our economy and society.  These changes have been defined by domestic economic circumstances, a downturn of unprecedented pace and increasing devastation caused around the world by climate change.  This has left us facing the immense challenges of unemployment, declining living standards, financial and banking scandals and incompetence as well as significant pressures on the public finances.  The Government is working hard to address these challenges and while it has made mistakes, it has shown a desire to create fairness.  The Green Party has played a key role in these decisions and is proud to stand over its record of creating a green economy, protecting our environment and working towards the reform of our banking and political systems.  In addition, my party has produced a major plank for reform of the planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">In the past two years, as I looked across the Chamber and listened to the speeches and questions of Deputies opposite, I have not seen leadership or heard anything but opportunism and contradictory rhetoric.  The parties opposite have become experts in denouncing every decision and putting opportunity before country, while basking in nostalgia for their most recent period in government, more than 12 years ago.  I do not know if this nostalgia is for the rainbow coalition's lack of fiscal discipline, decision to prioritise tax cuts over redistribution or its approach to hepatitis C victims, disregard for the environment or scandalous cutbacks in education at a time of increasing revenue returns.  Irrespective of the reason, this nostalgia becomes more perverse by the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">To paraphrase Deputy Charles Flanagan's words about the then Opposition, there is a contradiction between motions condemning the curtailment of public expenditure and the day-to-day reality of party spokespersons calling for further resources for health, education, social welfare, agriculture and a host of other schemes requiring higher expenditure.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">My party leader informed the House about what Deputy Gilmore thinks of the Fine Gael Party and its policies.  The letter he cited continues: "Nor can change be achieved by supporting independents or other parties that lack a coherent strategy".  Deputy Gilmore referred to change and coherence in the same sentence, yet three Opposition parties have never been so polarised in policy terms or more incapable of providing a coherent response to a challenge.  I remain confident that on this side of the House the Government will continue to serve the best interests of the people.  It will not serve vested interests but the welfare of ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">My party fared badly in the recent local and European elections and I respect the verdict of those who voted for other parties.  Nevertheless, Fine Gael and the Labour Party remind me of characters in Spanish picaresque novels, those finely dressed men who sprinkle bread crumbs on their lapels and feign signs of having dined and wined with the best when we know their very appearance is a total sham.  They were men of straw, fakers and chancers who put on airs and graces to fool the public.  The electorate needs to know what the Opposition stands for because it is not clear to anyone in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">No one ever said that being in government would be easy and I am the first to admit we have had one hell of a week.  From the first day of this Government, I voiced my hopes, fears and dreams about being in government.  These hopes, fears and dreams remain and I ask myself every waking day whether we made the correct decision.  Despite the enormous difficulties we encounter in our work, I still believe the Green Party has made, is making and will make the correct decisions in or out of government.  Part of that job is listening and we have to listen more carefully to all voices.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">When I joined the embryonic Green Party more than 25 years ago we had a job on our hands trying to communicate what we stood for and wanted to achieve.  This job remains, even if many of the issues we stand for have entered the mainstream.  There is a danger that ideas will be open to misinterpretation, particularly when others try to steal our clothes.  While I welcome the Fine Gael Party's conversion to the green cause, I am somewhat concerned that in assuming the mantel it neglects the substance.  The Fine Gael Party's new-found conversion to the green cause has a touch of the zeal of a reformed smoker.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The expression, "all hat and no cattle", is used in Texas.  Fine Gael may talk the talk on climate change but I am not convinced it yet has substance.  While I welcome Deputy Kenny's stirring words on climate change and his criticism of giant gas guzzlers better suited to a safari than the school run being used in our cities and suburbs, he seemed to actively encourage his by-election candidates to use sports utility vehicles to navigate the treacherous off-road conditions in Dublin South and Dublin Central.  I would welcome his party's new-found interest in proper planning if it was not still busy rezoning half of rural County Mayo for development.  Clearly, proper planning in the eyes of half of the Fine Gael Party's front bench means building anything anywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I would welcome Fine Gael's interest in abolishing quangos if the party did not propose to establish the mother of all quangos, a new State industrial holding company to be known as the new economy and recovery authority or NewERA, whose purpose would be to co-ordinate, restructure and finance existing and new State companies.  Its proposal would create yet another layer of bureaucracy and red tape.  I am not convinced it is the right way forward.  While the Fine Gael Party has good ideas, I regret it runs with the hare and hunts with the hound much too often.  It cannot knock every idea of the Government, good, bad or indifferent, and then shed crocodile tears about criticism of Ireland in the international media.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I am concerned about the cohesion, whether ideological or real, between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  For example, the moment the former announced its intention to table a motion of no confidence, the Labour Party indicated it may not be the right time for such a motion.  If that is a sign of co-operation in the future, it does not bode well for co-operation and putting together a carefully agreed programme.  Necessity is the mother of invention, but I am not convinced the policies dovetail.  I accept that the role of the Opposition is to oppose but I would look back and say when the Green Party was in Opposition we proposed far more often than we opposed. Fine Gael proposes a new State company to co-ordinate water supplies.  Is that the way forward?  One cannot publish proposals expressing concern about 800 quangos and then suggest we need several new State companies to overcome this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Labour and Fine Gael are quite often opposite in outlook, whether it be economically or socially, and I am not convinced they can meet neatly in the middle and propose coherent policies for the good of Ireland.  The Green Party has had a strong influence in Government.  We have a strong track record of achievement over the past two years and as long as we continue to make solid progress on implementing green policies, it is worthwhile being in Government.  I, therefore, support the motion of confidence in the Government.</p>

They have lost all credibility.  All they must think about is people like me who would always vote Fine Gael, Labour and Green.  I would always vote Green.  This time I said, "No way, no chance," because they have no credibility.  They have sold their souls to Fianna Fáil and that is why people will have nothing to do with them.  That is why the Green Party has done so badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The only way out is for them to say to this Government that they have principles by which they stand and that for the Green Party, for the cause of the environment and the future of this country they will walk from the dark side and give the leadership that the country needs.

They want a new Government under Fine Gael-Labour to bring about the change that is needed.</p>

They want work, not dole.  They want a future.  They do not want depression.  Above all, they want choice and change.

In the programme for Government they stated they would cut travelling times, improve safety, deliver real commuting choice, reduce congestion and protect the environment.  Instead of cutting travelling times, they cut bus services.  There are more than 200 fewer buses in the city of Dublin providing services to the ordinary people.  The Green Government is taking buses off the streets and leaving the public with a worse public transport system than before this Government took office.  Instead of offering real commuter choice, which in Green terms means public transport, the people are not getting that choice.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Not alone are they doing that, but they are driving private operators, who would provide that choice, off the streets of Dublin.  Why are there 30 buses lying idle outside the city?  A decent honourable company was run off the streets of Dublin because Dublin Bus competed unfairly with it.  Dublin Bus abused its position in the marketplace.  That is what the Department of Transport found and Deputy Gormley has done nothing about it.  He sits silent and shamed by his lack of credibility and lack of delivery on his promises.  Those are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Let us look at improved safety.  Let us look at the number of road deaths.  Too many people die on the roads.  At the beginning of the year, thankfully, although sadly nevertheless, the number was 20 fewer than the previous year.  The outlook was better and the policies were working.  What did Fianna Fáil and the Green Party do?  First, they cut back €150 million in regional and local roads which carry most of the traffic.  The Minister drove the country in his Mercedes.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">I want to correct a number of misapprehensions about this debate.  Fine Gael sought to table the motion during Private Members' time, but the Government decided to make it a Government motion, thereby moving the discussion on the Ryan report to the following two days.  None the less, this is an important confidence motion on the Government.  It is time that Members on the Government side listen to the people, who have spoken clearly.  People have had enough of the bungling Brians and the rest of the Government.  It has lost its way and, a long time ago, it lost its moral compass.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Regarding the economy's situation, 500,000 jobs will be lost by the end of the year and, according to the ESRI, another 300,000 may be lost next year.  This amounts to 800,000 jobless people, a truly frightening prospect.  The public finances have suffered the worst deterioration of any EU country.  This year, we will borrow €20 billion.  Fianna Fáil has kept Anglo Irish Bank going instead of winding it down, which was suggested by Fine Gael some time ago and by me before Christmas.  It is a salient point, given the stark choices that governments must make.  It is during times of crisis and difficulty that one's priorities are discovered and core values are exposed.  The Government's core values have been to protect the banks to the detriment of our health, education and many other services.  In every attempt, it has failed to reform the public service.  It has allowed a regulator to fall asleep at the wheel, as he took no action when action was badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">This side of the House has been accused of lacking any real solutions.  It is the most disingenuous accusation yet.  Unlike many other parties that are long on ideologies and short on solutions, we have tabled solutions for the health service, third level education fees and the creation of 100,000 jobs through the green economy, which is not the preserve of the Green Party.  Many people in industry are looking at it and have tried to erect wind turbines, but they must pay extraordinary fees to connect to the grid.  For example, I know of someone who is proposing to build three turbines but has had a connection fee of approximately €1.75 million indirectly intimated to them.  Such fees stymy any sort of effort at building a proper reserve of green energy.  I will ask direct questions of the Minister in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It is important that the Government move on something of concern to the people, namely, its approach to the economy and NAMA.  Some €7.5 billion has already gone to Anglo Irish Bank, which has more or less intimated that it will be back for more and that it will let the Government know when.  The taxpayers' cheque book is to remain open at the bank's behest.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Let us consider the political reality of the situation.  The people spoke loudly and clearly.  Mr. David Healy, adviser to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, lost his council seat.  Surely alarm bells went off.  If they were not ringing in the Minister's office, his hearing aid must have been switched off.  Perhaps he was asleep again or he has developed selective deafness, which is dangerous when one should be listening to the people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, knows that he lost his councillor in Fingal.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">Consider the Government's promises.  In 2007, the programme for Government stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_544">The recent development of a cervical cancer vaccine opens up the possibility of effectively ending cervical cancer within a few generations.  We believe it should be available as a universal public health entitlement once recommended by experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The experts recommended it and the Minister announced it, but she changed her mind three months later.  The programme also stated: "We will work towards doubling the number of consultants to appoint an extra 2,000 and bringing the total number to 4,000."  Since the consultants' contract was agreed in July 2008, 183 new consultant posts have been approved, but only 48 consultants have been appointed and fewer have taken up their positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The Government promised that the accident and emergency problem would be solved.  In March 2006, the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, said that it should have been treated as a national emergency and set up a task force to bring trolley waits to an end.  In reality, as many as 300 patients continue to lie on trolleys each day.  The National Health Strategy 2001 stated that, by the end of 2004, no public patient would wait longer than three months for treatment following a referral from an outpatient department.  The 2002 Fianna Fáil manifesto promised to end hospital waiting lists permanently within two years through a combination of bed capacity, primary care, secondary care and targeted reform initiatives.  What is the reality today?  Some 17,000 patients have been waiting for treatment for longer than six months.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, spends more than €110 million annually but makes no progress.  Over 18 months and for £36 million, the North fixed its waiting lists.  We can do the same, but the Government refuses to follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">In the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a renewed commitment was made by the Government to deliver 300 primary care teams by 2008, 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011.  Years have passed without progress.  We are told that 110 teams are in place, but one finds them to be virtual teams when one looks for them.  Approximately ten teams are fully staffed.  It is live horse, eat hay, as with so much that the Government does.  It promised to make general practitioner, GP, cards available to 200,000 people, but less than half have been delivered.  The total number of GP visit cardholders on 31 March 2009 was 87,277.  This occurred during a time when the qualifying income threshold was just over half of the minimum wage.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">The 2007 programme for Government stated that the Government would implement "plans for co-located facilities because this represents the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that public capacity is both increased and ring-fenced".  The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, announced her co-location plan on 14 July 2005.  Four years on, not a single one of the 1,000 beds which were promised is available.  In fact, not a single brick has been laid or a sod turned in any co-located hospital.  So much for speed and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In 2007, the programme for Government promised to develop a freely available and personalised national programme to provide for the prevention and early detection of illness for men and women, that the expert group would be established in 2007 and report by 2008.  The expert group still has not been established.  On mental health, it was stated the Government would invest in and fully implement the vision for change strategy and provide further additional funding to support recovery of mental health service provision.  Nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">It comes down to a strong message.  I must remark on the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  He spoke about his Government in the context of its courage in making tough decisions, words that might impress if the reality matched them, but the reality today is the decisions taken were tough on the people, particularly the vulnerable, but not tough on the Government itself or tough on reforming the clearly dysfunctional systems of education, economic regulation or our health service, to mention but three areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">This is the Government that has displayed its courage by spending billions of taxpayers money to defend a developers' bank, while at the same time refusing to spend a few million euro on other measures, which deprived our young girls of protection against cancer, children with learning disabilities of their special classes and our terminally ill of a medical card — they must now queue for the right to die in a hospice.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Ministers have come out in unison to say they are listening to the people.  They may be listening, but they are not hearing what people say.  The Irish people have had enough of the sort of courage and toughness displayed by this Government.  Fine Gael wants to bring a new Government to this Republic which will have at its heart transparency, accountability and fairness across all State activity——</p>

          <p eId="para_556">The disingenuous nature of contributions and proposals emanating from Opposition benches over recent months served the parties opposite well last week.  I congratulate them on their ability to play politics.  The wonderland schools of Deputy Kenny's economics and Deputy Gilmore's spin gave the impression that the public would not have to face painful taxation, or spending and service provision changes under an Opposition Administration.  It is a privilege of being on the other side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The election is now over, but the adjusted live register figure stands at more than 400,000.  It is time for the superficial positioning to stop.  The constant argument that we would not start from here does not wash.  If the Deputies opposite are sincere about their desire to see Ireland return to the path of economic recovery and growth, it is time for serious proposals to be placed on the table which reflect the realities of our economic situation.  If not, then motions like that proposed today are merely playing to the gallery at a time when there is much serious work to be undertaken by Government and this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The policies being pursued by this Government are the correct policies at a time of difficult policy choices.  They are clearly not policies designed for short-term political gain.  They are, however, policies that, in the medium to long term, will result in Ireland's course being righted.  The public will recognise this and, having been on the doorsteps like everyone else over recent weeks, I know that many already understand the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">However, if this Government has had any failing in recent months, it has been a failure to communicate in simple terms to the wider public the steps we are taking, their rationale and the path on which they are taking us.  In that context, while I consider today's motion a distraction from the serious work required by the House, I welcome the opportunity afforded by this motion to put on the record my work, and the work of this Government, to protect and sustain jobs, to assist those in search of work or in need of training and to sharpen Ireland's job creation and entrepreneurial offering.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">I also welcome the opportunity afforded by this motion to set out some of my work, and that of this Government, to support the vital SME sector, to get credit flowing to business, ensure business are paid more quickly by Government, reform the public procurement process and support the expansion of Ireland's green economy.  I only regret I do not have the time to set out my work on many other areas, such as business regulation, competitiveness, the knowledge economy, workers' rights, competition and consumer law.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">All of these individual actions, together with many more that fall within the remit of my Department, are ultimately aimed at job retention and creation.  It is the singular goal behind my work and the work of this Government, as it is only through employment and enterprise, and the income that it generates, that we can fund so much else that this Government wants to achieve.  I want entrepreneurs, businesses, employees and those seeking work to know that this is my priority.  I want them to know I have listened to their concerns and have acted on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">As a result, over past months we have had initiatives such as the enterprise stabilisation fund to help protect jobs in our exporting companies hit by current difficulties.  Due diligence is under way on a scheme for export credit insurance to further assist our exporting companies.  A code of conduct for business lending to SMEs has been enacted, so our SMEs know where they stand regarding the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">A credit supply clearing group was established to tackle the credit supply issue, establish the facts and take on the spin and myths.  There is a commitment by central Government to pay its debts to business within 15 rather than 30 days.  A revamp is under way of our public procurement policy to make it more SME-friendly.  A Companies Law (Amendment) Act to toughen our company law regime against potential abuse was passed.  New tax changes were introduced to support job creation through the development of intellectual property assets in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">An unprecedented level of training and activation measures have been put in place to assist those seeking employment.  New and innovative programmes were established to keep people in jobs deemed vulnerable and to get graduates work experience.  A high level group on green enterprise was established and new FÁS courses to train people for jobs in the green economy were put in place, among many other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">We have not been slow either to act and engage on particular problem cases, such as the loss of jobs at Dell in Limerick, where we have established the mid-west regional task force and are ready to submit our application to the European globalisation fund; at Waterford Crystal, where we worked hard to find a buyer and salvage redundancy for the workers; and at SR Technics, where we intervened to ensure that skilled expertise is not lost to Dublin.  There are many other lesser-profile cases where we have also engaged to save jobs, support the resolution of problems and protect viable enterprises, but this work often, of necessity, goes unspoken of.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">All of this work is being undertaken at a time of unprecedented challenges for Ireland and our economy.  All in this House know that stabilisation of our public finances and resolving the problems in our banking system are key to our economic recovery.  While we have complete incoherence on the Opposition benches as to how these challenges would be met by an Opposition Administration, the Government has forged ahead and taken necessary decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Without decisive corrective action, our public finances, already under strain, would quickly have reached unsustainable levels.  A combination of taxation increases, expenditure reductions and efficiency gains were necessary and had to be put in place.  More will also have to follow.  Implementing these measures will not be without pain, but in the medium to long term, these, together with cyclical improvements in the economy, will restore the public finances below the required 3% of GDP and protect the long-term viability of this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Difficulties in the banking sector are also being addressed through a series of targeted responses which include a guarantee of certain liabilities, nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, a recapitalisation programme, the proposed establishment of NAMA and improvements in the regulatory regime.  Again, incoherence on the Opposition benches leaves the public without any comprehension of a likely alternative to these decisive actions taken by Government.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_392" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_572">Contrary to popular misconception, the Government's measures are not about shoring up profits for banks and bankers.  They are about maintaining a properly functioning and well regulated banking infrastructure, without which confidence in and the credibility of this country as a place in which to invest and do business would be lost, together with tens of thousands of jobs.  Opposition proposals risk the alienation of foreign direct investment and the international credit markets, ranging from the Icelandic extreme of nationalising our banking sector by the Labour Party, to the creation of a zombie banking sector and their ultimate liquidation by Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The goal of this Government is to get credit flowing to viable businesses again.  A further initiative in this regard is my decision to establish a credit supply clearing group.  It will identify patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and will seek to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  Representation on the group includes the key banks, business organisations and State agencies, as well as departmental officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The banking sector is the recipient of substantial State support not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the wider economy.  I expect the banking sector to behave responsibly and to play a constructive role in providing credit to viable businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">As further support to small business, I recently introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by Departments to their business suppliers from 30 days to 15 days.  Departments have been encouraged to give priority to processing their payments and will report on their progress in complying.  The commitment will have effect in respect of all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009.  This measure should help ease cashflow difficulties for SMEs doing business with Departments.  I am also looking at what regulatory changes might be required in the area of company law to address concerns that have recently come to light in the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">On foot of recent revelations about directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank, I asked the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, whether he considered any amendments were necessary to the Companies Acts.  His proposals are captured in the Companies (Amendment) Bill, which is currently on Report Stage in the Seanad.  On the director's ongoing investigation of certain activities at Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited, I am providing additional staff to the ODCE from my Department for this complex investigation.  The director has indicated that the investigation is progressing satisfactorily and that his office is working constructively with the bank, the Financial Regulator and other relevant parties in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The new enterprise stabilisation fund is further evidence of this Government's commitment to supporting business in the current challenging environment.  The fund is targeted at vulnerable international trading companies to help them survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets and to sustain employment.  Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.  Since the launch of the fund in April 2009, there have been discussions with a wide range of companies to consider whether they are interested in developing business plans and in applying for the fund.  Initial feedback from companies is that enterprise stabilisation funding would enable them to continue to operate and to sustain and build their businesses and ultimately grow in a very difficult operating environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Companies from all sectors are seeking support with the main issues of concern, namely, the sterling exchange rate, loss of sales, funding from the banking sector, competitiveness, construction industry and energy prices.  Several hundred companies have been engaging with Enterprise Ireland on the fund and 60 companies are now being intensively assisted to develop definitive project applications to the enterprise stabilisation fund with a view to releasing such funding as soon as practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Due to a market failure for some companies seeking export credit insurance, I asked Forfás and Enterprise Ireland, working with my Department, to undertake an analysis of the issue.  An additional factor is that two other EU member states, Luxembourg and Denmark, have recently taken steps to introduce short-term State-backed export credit insurance schemes.  The Forfás research established that the difficulties in obtaining commercial export credit insurance are closely related to the wider problem of credit availability for business generally.  This latter issue is being pursued as part of the review of bank lending, being undertaken as part of the banks recapitalisation programme, and the issue of trade finance is also covered by the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">In addition, the new credit supply clearing group that I referred to earlier will identify patterns where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked, which should help to address issues around trade finance and working capital that are all part of the problem.  Following the Forfás research, which assessed the extent of the problem and associated issues, we have decided to initiate an accelerated tendering process to carry out forensic due diligence on the credit insurance market in Ireland.  That tendering process is already under way and the due diligence will include an in-depth examination of the client databases of the main credit insurance providers operating in Ireland and will assess the extent and nature of market failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The due diligence will also assess the costs and impacts of possible intervention by the State in this area.  While that is a significant and necessary step in the process, it is not, of itself, a decision to introduce a scheme.  On completion of due diligence, the matter will be considered further.  Issues such as default risk, Exchequer exposure to costs, value for money and the impact of any such scheme on business will be part of the exercise in hand, and will inform any future Government decision on whether to introduce a State-backed top-up export credit insurance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Ireland has a significant opportunity to secure a central position in the global environmental goods and services sector and has a growing company base to realise same.  The sector is expected to grow due to a number of factors including, increasing waste generation, increasing cost of waste management, legal and environmental requirements, increasing demand for raw materials, and resource depletion.  We are working hard to create the right conditions for the development of a new wave of entrepreneurial activity and employment opportunity in this growth sector.  Unlike the proposals from across the House, we are working with private sector entrepreneurs to achieve that.  That is why I have established the high level action group on green enterprise under the chairmanship of Joe Harford.  It is tasked with advising on the right mix of policy measures necessary to ensure the development of a viable and sustainable green economy in Ireland.  There is huge potential for the green economy to help Ireland meet its economic and environmental challenges.  The latest estimates put the size of the global environmental goods and services market at in excess of €950 billion by 2010.  That is a market from which Ireland must take a significant share and we can only achieve that by working closely with those entrepreneurs at the cutting edge.  We do not want to create State-run monoliths, as proposed by the party opposite, in such a vibrant sector, which would crowd out private sector ingenuity, create dead weight and displace private sector investment to other jurisdictions.  What we want to achieve is a comprehensive set of initiatives and flexible policy measures and supports that are responsive to the needs of a sector that has the potential to create much employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">One of the Government's key priorities is to respond to the challenge of the rapidly increasing unemployment levels.  The Government is determined to provide those who are unemployed with the necessary support services and training to enable them get back into employment as soon as possible.  By providing those individuals with the opportunities to improve their skills and competencies we are not only increasing their employability but improving the skills level of the entire labour force, which will benefit us all in the years ahead.  Since the end of last year the Government has taken a variety of actions to help those who are unemployed get back to work.  In recent months we have doubled the capacity in the job search support, training and work experience programmes.  In particular, the capacity of the job search supports system provided by FÁS employment services and the partnership-based local employment service has been doubled to 150,000 places per year.  In addition, the number of people who can be offered training places under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been doubled to 128,000 places.  That includes a quadrupling to 92,000 places in short-training courses, which are occupation-specific and will give individuals specific skills so that they can compete for specific job vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">In addition, I have launched initiatives such as the work placement programme, which aims to provide participants with six months work experience and the short-time training programme, which trains people who are on short-time working.  In both cases, participants are allowed to retain their social welfare allowances while participating in those programmes.  In consultation with the social partners, we are also working on proposals to promote job retention and aim to implement increased supports in this area.  The Government is continuing to explore all possible initiatives and measures that will further increase employment opportunities and enhance the provision of training and education activation places.  It is clear from the range of initiatives identified by the Government that we have been proactive and positive in addressing the concerns of business as it seeks to weather the current turbulence in the global economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Last December, in response to the much more challenging economic environment, the Government introduced A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  That document set out a clear roadmap for Ireland's move back to economic growth and prosperity, with investment focused on those areas where we can build on our existing strengths, address weaknesses and make ourselves ready to grasp the opportunities when the upturn in the global economy begins.  The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal includes measures to secure the enterprise economy and enhance competitiveness, address innovation, environment, energy and infrastructure issues, as well as the pursuit of greater efficiency and effectiveness in public services and regulation.  Our past success has been built on our agility as a small open economy to trade our way to economic success.  Our policies are directed at assisting enterprises to be primed to take advantage of renewed growth among our main trading partners including Britain, Europe, the United States and Asia.  The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2009, ranks Ireland, out of 57 countries, first for real corporate taxes, investment incentives, foreign investor freedom and skilled labour; third for flexibility and adaptability of people and fourth for labour productivity.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">If this Government remains in power any longer the economy can only worsen.  In a time of adversity, a Government must lead its people and this Government cannot lead its people because the people have lost  confidence in them.  The people have been led up the hill and dropped over the cliff and simply will not follow them again.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and other Ministers state that the public will not accept the harsh measures because they have not fully realised the difficult situation our economy is in.  That is absolute rubbish.  The public know exactly the position the country is in.  They know this from their reduced weekly wage packages, the loss of pensions and savings, negative equity, lost jobs and the loss of expectations for themselves and their children.  They will not accept solutions from this Government whom they believe caused the problems.  The Government can come up with all the schemes it likes, they will not be accepted by the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Government would have us believe that our problems are the problems being experienced the world over but, they are not.  Our budget deficit and unemployment rate is twice that of Britain.  Contrary to what the Tánaiste said earlier, on almost every scale that we are measured we are at the bottom when we need to be at the top and are at the top when we need to be at the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Government would also have us believe the rest of the world is following our example in dealing with the financial crisis.  That is more rubbish; it is not.  This would be laughable were it not so serious.  Even the rating agencies as recently as yesterday passed their verdict on Government management of the banking and public finances as they further downgrade our credit rating, making our borrowing ever more risky and expensive.  Financial markets look at us if not as one of the basket case countries then certainly one of the bad boys of Europe, accumulating a huge burden of debt to be passed on to our children.  Much of this debt burden is to be used to protect the loans of the bond holders and international investors who funded the property gamble.  The Government would have us believe that these risk takers cannot be allowed to lose and that they must get their money no matter what; that we have a national responsibility to repay them, even though they better than most, knew exactly the level of risk they were taking on.  Again, that is rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The Government would have us believe every other country is protecting such lending.  This is not so.  Far from it.  These are not Government bonds.  This is not sovereign lending.  Investors knew exactly what they were doing.  They were taking a gamble, pure and simple.  It was a risk that they knew would be profitable for a while but could only last for a particular time.  The average tax payer played no part in this; they were victims.  Now, the Government is asking them to pay for the risks taken by others, people whose job it was to evaluate those risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The Government would also have us believe NAMA is the only solution to the banking crisis.  It is not.  While it is one possible solution, it is a high risk and high cost solution for which, if it works, the taxpayer will pay for years.  If it does not work, the entire structure of the economy will collapse leaving us facing a multi-generational recession.  While the Government continues with this type of rhetoric, the economy is haemorrhaging jobs and self confidence. Please do not tell us the rest of Europe is in awe of the Irish Government's economic management and financial innovation.  That is simply not true.  The remainder of the world, and in particular the European Commission, are making the best of a bad lot and handing Ireland a lifeline.  However, Ireland and its people are not willing to hand this Government a lifeline.  It has pulled the rug from under the aspirations and expectations of every family and they do not want another day of its leadership.  If the Government looks it will see it has lost the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">It is clear that in respect of arts, sport and tourism the Minister responsible simply does not understand that the landscape has changed utterly.  The days when all that was required of him was to open hotels and hand out grants are gone and gone forever.  While jobs in this sector disappear daily the Minister sees no role for himself in this area.  He has no sense of responsibility to champion the sector or to ensure his colleagues in Government understand the barriers to tourism their policies are causing.  What Minister seeking to attract visitors who spend €50 million per annum here would allow a tax to be imposed on them when they arrive here?  What type of insanity is that?  Why did this Minister allow this to happen and why when everybody in the tourism sector is saying this is madness, does he not raise his voice against it?   What Minister would stand by and see air access to this country contract and contract without even expressing concern?  Why does he allow visas to visit this country to be dearer here than anywhere else and allow the OPW to close our heritage sites in high season?  Why does he support decisions which disadvantage our tour operators and make their costs higher than in any other European country?  This Minister is not strong enough to play, or even see, a co-ordinating role in all those other areas which do not alone impinge on tourism but are fundamental to tourism policy.  He has stood by and said nothing about the fact that we have no direct contact from many parts of the world from where traditionally our long haul visitors came.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Aer Lingus is now acting as a cheap airline with no code sharing.  It has moved its Heathrow slot to Gatwick to service other countries.  Flights that previously departed from Ireland and brought people to Ireland are now departing from and arriving at Gatwick.  The same happened in Belfast.  Not a word was said when Aer Lingus silently moved its slots to Gatwick.  Tourism is our biggest employer, or at least was until six months ago, employing almost 300,000 people.  It is a vital industry for the country and too important to languish in a Department wherein the Minister either cannot or will not ensure it is at the centre of national economic policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">It is time to close that Department, to create a new Department of culture and sport and to move tourism to a Department where economic and commercial considerations are to the fore.  However, where there is no leadership, no accountability and no dynamism, that cannot happen.  It will not happen under this Government.  They are so out of touch I do not expect the Fianna Fáil members of Government to even see the relevance of what we are saying today.  The Green Party, whose members are not in the House to hear us and who are only two years in Government, want, understandably, to focus on the green agenda and have persuaded themselves the prize is worth the price and that nothing else matters.  However, they have been fooled.  They have mistaken pathetically meagre concessions from Fianna Fáil for a total policy conversion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are asking the people to pay too high a price for too small a green gain, a gain that can and would be delivered by any Government with sense.  I say to them: "Withdraw, while you still have some credibility and while there is still something to be salvaged for the people and allow a Government with a vision, ideas and energy to get us out of the mess that has been created."</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_605">I join other Members in congratulating Deputies George Lee and Maureen O'Sullivan on their election to Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Tánaiste forgot to mention in her contribution regarding our ranking in the "World Competitiveness Yearbook" that our overall position of 19th represents a fall from 12th since her appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Perhaps she might interrupt her self-congratulations to explain why we have fallen so fast during her tenure.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">This motion comes in the aftermath of the local and European elections.  Irrespective of whether this House votes confidence in the Government, the people have sent a clear message that they lack such confidence.  Never has a Government done so badly in local and European elections.  This extraordinary failure is a sign from the people that they no longer have confidence in the ability of the parties opposite to govern.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">For Fine Gael, these were excellent elections.  For the first time since I was two years old, my party received more than 30% of the national vote.  It increased its vote by more than any other party and this is the first time since its foundation that it received more first preference votes than Fianna Fáil.  In a sea change in Irish politics, we now have 340 councillors, or almost as many as Fianna Fáil and Labour combined.  The Labour Party did extremely well in the European elections in equalling Fianna Fáil in the number of candidates elected.  Although Fine Gael lost one MEP, we increased our share of the vote and are now the only truly national party in terms of having one MEP in each of the four European Parliament constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Several of my colleagues had harsh words for the Green Party but I am sorry its Deputies are not here for my words because they are softer than might have been expected.  All three of the Green Party's councillors in Fingal County Council, namely, David Healy, Robbie Kelly and Joe Corr, lost their seats.  As someone who has worked with them on the council, I take no pleasure in seeing this and do not think they are to blame.  Their losses in the election are related to their colleagues' participation in Government rather than their work on the ground.  Unfortunately, politics is cruel.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">These local elections were very different from previous ones.  We are regularly told that all politics are local but in these elections all politics were national.  I could not believe how few local issues were raised with me on the canvass nor how many people wanted to discuss national questions.  Even in the last general election, to the extent that national issues arose they were manifestations of local issues, for example, when a school would be built.  This election was very much about the economy, jobs and national questions.  In that sense, the public has used the local and European elections to give a verdict on national issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Government likes to put about the idea that every government in Europe took a beating at the polls, but that is not correct.  In Italy, the People of Freedom Party increased its MEPS, as did the UMP, French President Sarkozy's party.  Despite taking limited losses, Christian democratic parties in Germany, Holland, Belgium and Poland won their elections.  The success of centre right governments across Europe in holding or increasing their seats belies the spin from Government circles that European governments in general are taking the hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Several speakers have referred to popular anger at the Government's decisions.  People are not merely angry because of unpopular decisions.  Above all, they are angry that nobody in Government has taken responsibility.  Ministers are not responsible for all our economic problems but they are at least partly to blame for the fiscal and banking crises and the over reliance on the property sector.  The failure of the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, to accept any degree of personal responsibility for the mess we are in has fuelled that anger among the public.  The time has come for the Taoiseach, who as Minister for Finance introduced an expansionary budget which increased borrowing and spending while decreasing taxes even though the credit crunch was already underway, to accept some responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The public is also angry because many of the decisions being taken by the Government are wrong.  Its tax increases, banking strategy and undermining of competitiveness are all wrong.  Further anger has erupted because of the Government's failure to communicate.  The Taoiseach, and the Tánaiste to a lesser extent, do not even believe they have to explain to the public why these hard decisions have to be made.  It is a case of my way or the highway and support me or I will scream.  It is a big mistake to approach the public with entirely the wrong attitude.  They appear almost irritated at the public for not understanding or being thankful for the cuts and taxes they imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, asked whether the Opposition could do a better job.  I believe we can.  It is being insinuated that Fine Gael and the Labour Party will have to agree on everything in order to form a coherent Government.  Fine Gael and Labour are different parties.  We broadly share the same objectives even if we differ on how we should reach them.  Any Government that emerges from a general election will be a coalition of parties.  It certainly will not comprise the present Government coalition.  If Fine Gael does well enough, we may lead a Government with the support of a smaller party.  Alternatively, it might involve a coalition of Fine Gael and Labour or even Fianna Fáil and Labour.  The comments made by Deputy Burton on RTE last night reveal this is on the mind of Labour Party Members.  Parties will be required to put their proposals to the people and to seek their mandate.  Fine Gael will be asking people to vote for our plans and not for a coalition arrangement.  We have already put forward our views on the fiscal crisis and that it should be addressed by reducing Government spending by 4% annually rather than through tax increases, which this Government proposes, or borrowing, which is the Labour Party solution and which essentially means sending the bill to our children and grandchildren.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In regard to the banking crisis, we have been clear that a new bank should be established with Government capital and ECB funding and that the hit should be borne by the existing banks and the owners of subordinated debt and bondholders who have taken this risk.  This would minimise the risk to the taxpayer while freeing up credit to businesses and home buyers more quickly than the alternatives.  Those who advocate nationalisation only need to observe the lack of success in nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, which has not lent any money in the past six months despite already costing us €7 billion.  That is certainly not the solution.  NAMA will lead to the inevitable nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks and possibly Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">We have put forward plans on employment, supporting businesses, competitiveness and health care.  Unlike other parties, we are not committed to the HSE and its bureaucracy because we want an entirely new system for funding health care.  Through NewERA, we have also made proposals on how we will fund infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">One of the major issues that will confront all of us is the Lisbon treaty.  It is important that the Irish people ratify the treaty and the best chance of ensuring this is by electing a new Government.  When the referendum is held in October or November, I fear it will again be voted on having regard to this Government's performance.  If that is the case, the referendum will be defeated.  The longer this Government and Taoiseach remains in office, the fewer the chances of passing the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I support much of what the Green Party is doing in government, including its work on sustainable development.  I support some of the efforts the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is making to change the planning laws but not all of them.  I support the efforts the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is making to achieve energy independence.  I recognise that there has been willingness on the part of the Green Party to take hard decisions and to be a party of Government.  By and large, it also changed its position on the European Union with regard to the Lisbon treaty.  However, other things could be done but are not.  I believe the Green Party would like to develop such things as real local government reform and transfer power to democratically elected councillors.  I believe they would like to change the way we fund politics by ending corporate and trade union fundraising for political parties, change the way we make public appointments, on which the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has taken action in the Broadcasting Bill 2008, and re-embrace our commitment to overseas development aid.  I honestly believe the Green Party in government would support these measures, which is why I ask its Members to consider their position in government and to consider the possibility of forming a new one after a general election with a different lead party.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">We face an economic challenge of enormous proportions to fix the banks and restore competitiveness; we face a budgetary and reputational crisis; we need to get the Lisbon treaty passed prior to the end of the year and we need to reform our public services.  To do these we need a new Government with a new team, a new Taoiseach and a five-year mandate.  This is why I oppose this motion and why I hope the general election will come sooner rather than later.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_620">The political background to this motion is the outcome of last week's local, European and by-elections, which the Taoiseach acknowledged today produced poor results by Fianna Fáil's standards.  It was an especially difficult campaign because we found ourselves in very difficult economic circumstances and the Government has had to take very tough decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">People are clearly angry about their changed circumstances.  Everyone is paying more taxes than they were last year, many people have taken pay cuts and, worse still, thousands of jobs have been lost.  The people have spoken and we will reflect on how we will address the concerns expressed during the campaigns.  However, at the outset, I want to deal head-on with the Opposition's suggestion that the Government has no mandate as a result of the local and European elections and the by-elections.  I do not accept that.  The very suggestion is cynical and disingenuous and it shows scant regard for constitutional proprieties and the democratic traditions of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">All of us cherish free speech and open and transparent democracy but we should also respect the rules and systems that give us these freedoms and not seek to misuse them or misinterpret them for political gain.  Under our Constitution, the Government is elected by Dáil Éireann.  It is not elected by county councils or members of the European Parliament.  This Government has the same mandate that every other Government had in the history of the State — the support of the majority of Deputies in Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">As long as this Government maintains the support of the majority of this House — and I am confident we will when the vote on this motion takes place — we have a legitimate constitutional mandate to govern.  Anyone who denies that is in conflict with provisions of Bunreacht na hÉireann is out of step, but Fine Gael and the Labour Party know that.  They know the Taoiseach's mandate is precisely the same as John Bruton's was in the rainbow Government in which Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore served.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">No one can deny the Opposition their performances in last week's elections but they would do well to remember that in Britain William Hague, Ian Duncan Smith and Michael Howard each defeated Tony Blair in local elections and announced their impending national victory.  Not one of them went so far as to buy shoes for a visit to Buckingham Palace.  In Ireland, governments of all types have suffered defeat in local elections over the past 40 years.  Incumbent Governments suffered bad results in local elections in 2004, 1991 and 1985 yet there was no general election as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">We must always remember that our duty in this House is to serve the people and their needs, not our parties and their ambitions.  As an small open economy, Ireland is being hit hard by the global economic downturn and, as a society, we are finding the severe adjustment in living standards and employment prospects very difficult to accept.  I acknowledge that what has been hit are not just wage packets or tax revenues; our national self-confidence has been shaken too.  It is in the context of this national economic struggle that we debate this motion here this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">As families deal with the human toll of recession, the Government is taking decisive — though admittedly unpopular — steps to lead our nation out of severe economic difficulty.  The Government is spearheading an economic response that has been unmatched in its breadth, speed and force.  Our steps to tackle the worsening global financial and economic crisis have been measured and well planned.  These include the €1 billion package of savings and efficiencies announced last July; the budget last October that arrested the growth in public service spending and imposed a discipline across all areas of expenditure; the series of emergency measures, including the public service pension levy in February; and the supplementary budget in April.  The cumulative effect of these various rounds of expenditure measures has been an overall saving of at least €4.3 billion this year or 3% of GNP.  Without these measures, the deficit would have been as high as 15% as against 10.75% of GDP.  No other country in Europe has achieved this level of adjustment.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The Government has moved to protect systemically-relevant institutions and the stability of the Irish financial system while at the same time being conscious of the need to protect taxpayers.  We have taken a decisive and measured approach to issues facing the financial sector.  This approach included the guarantee on deposits up to next September; the recapitalisation programme for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland and the commitment to look at the needs of other institutions; the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank; the proposal to put in place a State guarantee for the future issuance of debt securities with a maturity of up to five years; the review and reform of the structures, role and functioning of the Financial Regulator and the relationship with the Central Bank in light of the current situation; and the announcement of the decision to establish a National Asset Management Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Our sole objective in all the actions we have taken is to ensure that householders can access credit for home loans and consumer spending; that small and medium-sized businesses can fund their enterprises; that deposit-holders have confidence that their money is secure and protected; and that international investors are satisfied about the stability of our banking system.  As the economic situation constantly shifts across the globe, we must retain flexibility so that our response can be adapted to fit developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">It is telling that the Government's approach has been endorsed in recent weeks by Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the eurozone Finance Ministers, who stated that Ireland is "making some very brave efforts" to address our economic challenges.  Mr. Juncker and Commissioner Almunia stated the April supplementary budget was the correct approach to our economic and fiscal difficulties.  The latest ESRI survey showed that Ireland is on track for a sustained economic recovery in the coming years if we stay the course the Government is taking.  The International Monetary Fund has stated that Europe could turn the corner next year if we continue to take the right decisions and, in the words on one economic commentator we are moving from rescuing the economy to recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Now is not the time to turn back.  The Government's task is not easy and the necessity to take severe corrective action is impacting on public services and on people's take-home pay.  However, there is no other way.  There is no alternative to taking tough short-term decisions if we are to position this country for economic growth in the long term.  We took these tough decisions mindful of the near-term political consequences but at the same time acutely conscious of our responsibilities to our country and to future generations of Irish people.  If the price of short-term unpopularity is Ireland's future and our return to growth, it is a price worth paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">In the power vacuum of Opposition politics, it would seem that such tough decisions are not necessary.  For instance, Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore do not operate according to the real life figures of Exchequer returns but it seems the temptation to sound out the political polemic is irresistible in that whatever our nation's economic problems, and there are many, it is more important to the Opposition to embrace the grubby partisanship of self-serving politics rather than seek to fight for the common good.  If party is more important than country at this critical time for our nation, then the Opposition parties' words in this debate reduces genuine public service to a cheap commodity traded in the interest of boosting poll numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Opposition's motion has nothing to do with getting people back to work or with saving faltering businesses.  It has nothing to do with closing the Exchequer deficit or inspiring public confidence but it has everything to do with courting populist plaudits with one eye on the next opinion poll rather than the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The job of the Opposition is not just to oppose.  Rather, it is to oppose responsibly.  This Government has a mandate that runs until 2012 and we're committed to leading this country out of the international recession.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">The reality is that Fine Gael and Labour are trying to hoodwink the Irish people with a set of populist con-job policies that would drive the country into deeper recession.  They are abusing their positions of responsibility by dodging the tough policy decisions that must be taken to get this country out of severe economic difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">In times like these, Ireland does not need fair weather supporters.  We need credible, realistic alternatives and politicians who will stand up and be counted.  This Government is standing up for the Irish people and for the generations who will follow us.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">As a Government led by the Taoiseach, we have achieved much in the past 13 months, not least in education.  It might be news to Sinn Féin but we are already investing €614 million in the school building programme and €162 million in new on-campus buildings in third level institutions.  In addition to dramatically improving our physical educational infrastructure, we will create almost 5,000 much-needed direct jobs in the construction sector through these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Take-up is strong on my initiative to use grant aid for the purchase of temporary accommodation and to instead build permanent classrooms.  It is now the case also that if temporary accommodation is required for more than three years the Department will offer a school a grant to buy it rather than to rent it.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">For the first time an expert group is developing a national strategy for higher education, and I have increased the income limits for student grants for the 2008-09 academic year.  Last year, I announced the provision of the extra 1,500 post-leaving certificate places from September as part of the Government's response to the education and training needs of workers who face unemployment or who have lost their jobs.  The extra allocation means that the total number of PLC places on offer now for the 2009-10 academic year will be almost 32,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Earlier today I heard Deputy Gilmore trying to smear our record on special educational needs but the reality is that this year the Government will spend more than €1 billion on special needs — almost one ninth of my entire education budget.  There are now more than 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs, including more than 10,000 special needs assistants.  It is timely to remind the Opposition that when it was in power, the figure was 300.  More than 8,000 resource and learning support teachers work in our schools.  It is timely to remind the former rainbow coalition that there were 2,000 in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Last December, the Government published a blueprint for economic development to build Ireland's smart economy.  Such an economy will support a thriving enterprise culture, ensure the highest quality standards, reward entrepreneurship and ultimately secure our energy supplies.  We have implemented a number of initiatives to support this new strategic direction for the economy which will provide quality well-paid jobs to current and future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Earlier this month I announced a call for proposals worth €300 million under cycle five of the programme for research in third level institutions.  That was an important signal of the Government's continuing determination to lay the foundations for our future competitiveness, create and protect high level jobs in the smart economy and accelerate our recovery.  Our capacity for innovation relies equally on the quality of undergraduate provision across the sciences, arts and humanities in our third level institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">In these more difficult economic times, we must ensure that we can protect and enhance the quality of provision and the growth in participation rates in higher education that have been so proudly achieved in the past decade.  The continuing development of our higher education system will be critical in placing Ireland at the forefront of international innovation, embedding high-value jobs in the Irish economy and encouraging international investors to continue to consider Ireland as a location that offers a highly skilled, creative and flexible workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The national strategy on higher education, due by the end of the year, will be important in identifying the means of achieving these objectives and when the global upturn comes, as it surely will, we will be well positioned to take full advantage because we are taking the right decisions now and invested wisely in our nation during the Celtic tiger years.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">As a direct result of the policies pursued by Government in those years, we recorded budget surpluses in ten of our 11 budgets; invested 80% of our resources in health, education and welfare; more than halved our national debt; put 3,500 extra gardaí on the streets; 10,000 extra nurses and doctors in our hospitals; 7,000 more teachers in our schools; invested heavily in our schools and public transport infrastructure; cut direct taxes; protected the vulnerable with the most generous social welfare system in the world; and put money aside for the future in the pension reserve fund which is now proving invaluable in our current financial crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">No one can claim that Ireland, as an open and small economy, should be immune from a 13% fall in world trade or that we could have avoided the impact of the credit crunch arising from a global banking system in crisis and the changes in the exchange rates between sterling and the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Greed and gross irresponsibility in some quarters of the private sector make our task today much more difficult than it ought to be but now is not the time for the backward look.  The truth is that we are much better prepared to adapt to the international downturn now than we were when the last recession hit during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">We must not repeat past mistakes by postponing necessary decisions or embroiling ourselves in negative campaigning.  Now is the time to press ahead in the common good.  At this time in our nation's history we must have statesmen and stateswomen on both sides of the House take the road of post-partisanship.  We must have a higher purpose that transcends narrow political self-interest and our common cause should be country, not party.  Our higher purpose should be the future of Ireland and all her people not the short-term gains of political expediency.  The Government will hold firmly to its decisions and will see them through.  When this period of Irish history comes to be written, it is my firm belief that it will be recorded in favour of those courageous enough to do what was right by our country and at the expense of those who shirked their responsibilities as Irish citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">I propose to share ten minutes with Deputy Joe Costello.  I add my voice of congratulations to the newly elected Deputies George Lee and Maureen O'Sullivan.  I welcome them to the House and I congratulate them on their magnificent elections over the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I have spoken on several confidence motions through the years and, normally, they fall into one of two categories.  The majority are probably <i>pro forma</i> motions because of significant or individual events.  However, others are profoundly important and serious and without a shadow of a doubt this debate falls into the latter category.  It is one of the most important confidence debates in which I have ever participated.  The country has never needed a change of Government more than now.  In the Government motion the House is asked to express its confidence in this Government.  If the House, which in its English form is the House of representatives, is to truly represent the will of the people, clearly expressed, then it has no option but to defeat the Government motion.  The people have spoken loud and clear, not only in opinion polls but on ballot papers.  Millions of people have spoken in three different elections, those being, the local elections, the European elections and two by-elections.  The people have no confidence in the Government.  If we are to reflect the will of the people and to be their representatives, Theachtaí Dála, then we must use the power we have to convey the people’s view tomorrow evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Certainly, the country is in a serious and dangerous position.  A new Government with fresh ideas and an appropriate mandate is required to lead the nation forward, to give the people confidence, to give business and enterprise confidence and to give the country a sense of purpose and a sense of direction.  Anyone — the Minister for Education and Science is not immune from this — who has asked people their view on what the Government is doing in recent weeks will have been left in no doubt of the view of the vast majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The argument from some Government Deputies that we cannot afford an election is spurious and wrong.  The fact is that we cannot afford not to have an election.  Every month and day in which this Government is in power diminishes the capacity of the nation to recover.  The scale and nature of the challenge is truly daunting.  Some 400,000 people are on our unemployment list, which is increasing daily.  This is truly staggering and frightful.  In individual terms, there are horror stories for families throughout the country.  The Government policy of drastic economic contraction can only add to the growing dole queues.  One priority above all else must be paramount, that is, maintaining existing jobs and creating new ones.  If this one area in not addressed then all the other fiscal policies and measures are futile.  The policy of taxing to pay an ever-increasing demand for jobseekers' benefit is a downward spiral of disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Labour has set out a ten point job creation plan, although I am sure the Minister has not read it.  He is too busy dismissing the Opposition, but then he calls for what amounts to a hollow expression for a national unity of purpose.  This is from the people who have led us into disaster after 12 years and who squandered the economy they were given in 1997.  It is an affront to the people and it takes some cheek to call now for solidarity from the people who left the economy in such a good state at that time.  The economy was handed over to them and they destroyed it in ten years with such wantonness.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The Labour Party has set out its policies, which may be debated on another occasion.  Whatever the Government may say, the debate on this motion is not whether we have confidence in the Opposition, its policies or what we can do from these benches.  It concerns whether the people and the Deputies elected by them have confidence in the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The Minister for Education and Science stated that Ireland does not need fair weather friends.  The Minister is confusing the country with his party.  Fianna Fáil has grown so used to power that its arrogance now confuses the Fianna Fáil party with the nation.  We have great confidence in our nation and we are not fair weather friends of it, but we have no confidence in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party, Progressive Democrats and Independents Government that has led us to disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">It has been said that this side of the House does not wish to be in government at this time.  I admit some of our supporters argue that this dreadful Government should be allowed to stew in its own juices.  That is an understandable view, but it is quite wrong.  As the Minister for Education and Science correctly stated, our country must come first.  The country simply cannot afford to allow the Government to remain in office.  The economic failure of the Government is clear for all to see.  However, other areas are equally disastrous for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I refer to the health services and the Government policy of colocation, which has thankfully been halted by the economic catastrophe.  One positive element of the economic catastrophe is that the policy of colocation has somewhat slowed.  The notion that we create a two-tier acute hospital system is scandalous and wrong.  For this reason alone, the Government should be thrown out.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">As the Minister for Education and Science will be aware, this morning the HSE published a report on acute services in the southern region.  The same attitude is being focussed on my region in the south east.  The national newspapers, including <i>The Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Examiner</i>, have published extracts from a leaked report that would attack the acute services throughout my region and reduce my general hospital in Wexford, which caters for the largest population base in the south east, to a minor medical centre.  All these issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency, but they can only be addressed with fresh thinking, new ideas and the vigour of a fresh mandate from a new Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I refer to the Green Party and I was in the House when the Green Party Deputy spoke.  I have some regard for Green Party policies and the individuals within the Green Party.  However, their contribution to the debate tonight reminds me of nothing more than "Comical Ali".  As the tanks were rolling through the streets of Baghdad, "Comical Ali" with the tanks in sight was still pretending that nothing was wrong and that all would be well on the night.  Their contribution in normal circumstances might have been amusing, but the Green Party's propping up of this Government is no longer funny.  We will have economic debates and we will have policy debates but tonight's debate is a simple matter.  The people of Ireland have spoken.  No amount of obfuscation or explanation will deny that fundamental fact and it is a requirement on each of the 166 Deputies elected to this House to act on the views of the people and dismiss this Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">I thank my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for sharing his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This is a very timely and important motion coming as it does immediately following the people having spoken in the European elections and in local elections.  These were very extensive elections involving every constituency.  In every constituency except Laois-Offaly, the message has been the same; Fianna Fáil has been rejected and the Greens have been decimated.  Fianna Fáil now has only three MEPs, one quarter of the total number of 12.  The party has only 218 out of 883 local authority seats and this is less than one quarter of the total number of available seats.  It has no MEP in Dublin and the Green Party, God help it, has lost all its local authority seats in Dublin, retains only three local authority seats in the entire country and it has no MEP.  Deputy Michael Lowry in Tipperary with four county council seats and three urban council seats is now a  much bigger political entity than the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Deputy Howlin and I listened to Deputy Gormley as he directed some snide remarks at the Labour Party.  He should get his facts right.  He referred to the Labour Party having abolished a levy in some budget but the statistics show that the only levy abolished was in 2005 and it was abolished by the person with whom he is in coalition, the current Taoiseach, who was the Minister for Finance and who abolished the bank levy.  This was a modest proposal at the time which took €103 million in the previous year from the banks because of their significant profits of €4 billion a year at that time.  Now the banks are making no profits and there is very little to take off them while in fact the Government is now distributing largesse to them.  I remind the House that in the 2005 budget, Deputy Brian Cowen abolished the bank levy.  If Deputy Gormley has other information, I invite him to come to the House and give it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The electoral turn-out in last week's election was 57.7%, a statistic that is not to be sneezed at as it is not a minimal turn-out.  It was a substantial turn-out as elections go.  It is clear the people have agreed a motion of no confidence in the coalition Government of the Greens and Fianna Fáil which now has the support of only one quarter of the electorate and has no mandate to govern.  It is as simple as that.  Every constituency voted against this Government and rejected it.  In the two by-elections, the people rejected the Government parties.  Fianna Fáil came third in Dublin South and a mere fifth in Dublin Central.  The brother of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern who had been Taoiseach up to 12 months' ago and had served in that office for eleven successive years, was destroyed in that election in Dublin Central, losing both the by-election and his council seat.  We are all people who operate in the field of public representation and therefore have a certain collegiality and I sympathise with the human and family tragedy created by such a downfall.  However, this was a political dynasty which was the strongest in the country and it is now crumbling and falling apart.  It was a sad day for Maurice Ahern but it has been a traumatic day for Fianna Fáil in its political heartland.  It is disingenuous of any Government Minister to argue that these were not the real elections and to say as the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, said on Sunday night, that a general election would produce what she termed, a different result.  For the first time in my 20 years in politics, the local elections were not fought on local issues but on national issues.  This election was fought on taxation, levies, corruption, cronyism, education cuts, job losses and the demise of small businesses and these were all the order of the day, not to mention the Christmas bonus.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is right; the result would be different but it would be a far worse result for this dysfunctional Government if a general election were to be called now.  This is a clear case of the two beaten parties hanging together — as can be seen from their contributions today — rather than hanging separately.  This is a case of personal survival or rather the personal interest being at stake.  The reference to the public interest and tough decisions is mere lip service.  If one makes tough decisions they must be the right decisions and they are not being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The reason for the collapse in support for the Government is quite simple; the Government failed dismally to confront the present economic crisis in any meaningful way.  It has become obsessed with bailing out the banking system; it has failed to protect small and medium enterprises by ensuring a regular cash flow and has therefore caused a continuing haemorrhage of jobs which has had a traumatic effect on family life and on the fabric of Irish communities and it has undermined people's jobs and careers.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I refer to the Small Firms Association, ISME, which for the past nine or ten months has been shouting from the rooftops that the Government has been sitting on its hands.  ISME members employ 800,000 people, a total of 50% of the entire private sector workforce yet they cannot get credit or a cash flow.  They cannot keep people in jobs even though they want to.  These are the companies which are haemorrhaging jobs because the Government is failing to put the pressure on the banks to lend the money.  The most recent survey last month shows that the majority of small and medium enterprises who have been ten years with a bank are not getting a cash flow.  The Government is guaranteeing the banks and recapitalising them and giving them the support of the €90 billion NAMA overhang debt bail-out but yet it cannot crack the whip and demand that they lend to those companies that need to employ people to keep exports and production moving.  The Government should tell the banks to go to Europe where money is available at a low rate of interest and to bring that money back into the Irish economy to be distributed.  The European Investment Bank is dying to lend the money to us and yet the Government will not take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">As the Labour Party spokesperson for European affairs, I have a particular concern about the prospect of the Government leading this country into the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  The same Government's mismanagement of the previous referendum last year was directly responsible for the failure to present a coherent campaign and contributed significantly to the rejection by the electorate of the treaty.  Deputy Martin is now the Minister for Foreign Affairs, although he was not at the time of the last referendum, and he understands the importance of this issue.  There is real danger that a second referendum presented by this same dysfunctional Government will be rejected because the people simply find this Government more and more untrustworthy.  A second rejection of the Lisbon treaty could have calamitous effects for the economy, for funding and finance from Europe, for foreign direct investment and for Irish exports.  These would be dealt a huge blow and with knock-on effects on our economy which is one of the most fragile economies not only in Europe but in the world and which is already virtually on its knees.  There is no way this Government could survive a second rejection of the Lisbon treaty in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I issue a warning that a furious, angry Irish electorate would take advantage of the opportunity presented by a second referendum to kick the Government again just as it did last week and vote accordingly.  This would be understandable in the present circumstances but it would be disastrous for the country and it could happen.  For Ireland's future in Europe, for its economic future and for the good of the people, the Government should go to the country now.  It should let a new Government with a fresh mandate lead the country in the second campaign to have the Lisbon treaty ratified and lead the country into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">That is the honourable action for the Government to take now.  I ask this of the Minister, who understands perhaps better than most what this entails and what a destructive thing it would be if we were to have a second rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  The Government should do the honourable thing in the national interest.</p>

There has been much talk from the Opposition about mandates and the will of the people.  There is not even the softest constitutional principle backing up the ridiculous idea that local authority elections can confer or remove a mandate to govern.  There is only a short leap from this to government by opinion poll, something that Fine Gael has believed in at least since the accession of Frank Flannery to the leadership of the party.</p>

It is true he has refused to engage in the model of constant campaigning, followed by others.  He has not run quarterly poster campaigns or "Evenings with Enda", or published daily statements praising himself.  What he has done is what we need from our Taoiseach at a time of the most serious recession in 70 years, namely, he has got on with doing the people's business.</p>

The Opposition has taken the position that it is in favour of dramatically reducing the deficit but it disagrees with the Government's actions to achieve this objective.  This is a perfectly legitimate position.  However, what is not legitimate is the constant refusal to offer an alternative set of actions.  Yes, there have been many general statements of support for being tough but these are never followed by specific measures which add up.  There are many policy soundbites but never a full alternative.  This is consistent with the fact that for seven years Fine Gael has refused to publish a comprehensive alternative budget.  There have been many documents published with aggregate figures but the hard decisions and a programme by programme basis have been avoided constantly.</p>

At that point, it will be up to all parties that believe in active, positive and self-confident Irish participation at the heart of the European Union to take their case to the people.  There will be a lengthy debate in the Oireachtas and we intend this to be held in a very constructive atmosphere.  In addition, we intend that the public will be kept fully informed at all stages of the process.  At the same time we will continue to intensify our work across Government to show the international community that Ireland remains a strong country with which and in which to do business.  Together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, I have been working to ensure we use every possible opportunity to promote Ireland internationally.  The staff and agencies of our Departments are working together closely and the feedback is very positive.  There have been many difficult areas but we have found that people are willing to listen to the details of what has happened and what has been done in response.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">My Department has made strong efforts and has worked hard through our embassies and consulates to promote a positive picture of Ireland.  We also attach a high value to developing Ireland's relationship with its diaspora and communities across the world.  It is vital we harness that resource.  As Members know, I am proceeding with a new strategy for engaging productively with the global Irish community.  A key element of that is the global economic forum which will be held at Farmleigh from 18 to 20 September.  The convening of the forum constitutes a major and innovative undertaking by the Department.  It is a national effort of outreach to and engagement with the most successful members of our global diaspora.  We will bring together for the first time the most influential members of the Irish community worldwide with a record of high achievement in business, politics, culture and sport, as well as a number of individuals with a strong business connection to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The primary purpose of the forum will be to explore how the Irish at home and abroad and those with a strong interest in Ireland can work together and contribute to our overall efforts at economic recovery.  Our discussions will also focus on the practical initiatives that will bring stronger, mutually beneficial links between Ireland and its diaspora.  It will also have a broader idea-generating remit, examining ways, for example, in which Ireland can become a leader in innovation and how we can harness to our best advantage Irish culture as a global brand.  We have received a very positive response to the initiative from those invited and look forward to a significant weekend for the country in September.  The initiative is an illustration of the kind of work we are doing in terms of responding to the economic crisis to move the country forward towards a position of hope and recovery.  Eventually, we hope to enjoy a strong position as an export oriented economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">The unprecedented measures which have been taken to tackle this unprecedented crisis are being recognised.  Institutions and companies which matter to this country have seen decisive action being taken.  They have seen the Government is willing to take the right choices, even if they are the toughest ones.  The concern last year that the action required was simply too tough for the Government to undertake no longer exists.  It is obvious we are not at the point of recovery yet, but no fair person can deny that the foundations for recovery are being put in place and there are positive signs of what will happen in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Fundamentally, the people are angry and disillusioned.  It is easy to try and exploit this, but the only way of addressing their concerns is to deliver action and recovery.  These are politically volatile times and Fianna Fáil has taken a hit.  However, it would be a huge mistake for anyone in the House to believe the situation today is the same as it will be in a few years' time.  The very purpose of representative democracy is that government and legislature reflect long-term, not short-term, opinion.  The declarations of impending victory and constant spinning of opinion polls are great for news cycles but have a poor record when it comes to electoral cycles.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">I take this opportunity to congratulate the winners of the by-elections and welcome them to the House.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan would have been a formidable candidate at any time, but the widespread sentiment and respect for Tony Gregory and her part on his team showed itself in what was an exceptional result.  Deputy George Lee is our best known new Deputy in many years.  Nobody could doubt his skills as a communicator and inquisitor.  I wish him well in mastering the august, calm constituency politics of Dublin South Fine Gael.  I look forward to working with both Deputies during the remaining years of this Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">This debate is founded on a view of politics as a never-ending campaign, where every decision and word is viewed solely through the lens of electoral calculation.  The Fine Gael Party has not sought to outline the details of an alternative government, but merely to provide another opportunity for its partisan speeches.  These are the same speeches which were delivered on the first day of this Dáil, when Deputy Kenny announced that even though he had lost the election, he had a mandate to govern.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Our country is in the middle of an international recession of unprecedented scale in the modern economy.  We have moved rapidly to deal with the unprecedented nature of that and to respond in terms of the public finances, the banking situation and in terms of developing a smart enterprise economy which will return the country to export oriented growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Many speakers have spoken about the past ten years.  One of the great myths that has been peddled is that all of the past ten years was a waste or lost opportunity or that growth was spurned or spirited away.  That is not the case.  The past ten years witnessed an incredible transformation of Ireland in terms of physical, education and health infrastructure.  I invite anyone to cast his or her mind back ten years to recall what any hospital, institute of technology or university campus was like then compared to now.  There is no comparison in terms of the transformation that has taken place in scale expansion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_795">Fine Gael threatened to put down a motion of no confidence, but the Government's motion today responded to that.  Ireland needs a new Government.  Despite what the Taoiseach said today, it is clear the public has lost faith and trust in the people who have been governing Ireland for nearly 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The election result was no minor mid-term protest intended to give the Government a wake-up call.  It was more fundamental than that.  It is dishonest of Ministers, such as Deputy Martin and others, to dismiss the result as nothing more than a mid-term go at the Government.  Many government parties in countries throughout the European Union which are experiencing recession did not get the response the Government received last Friday in two by-elections and in local and European elections.  We cannot continue as before with the approval of the public, as the Taoiseach proposes to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">Government spokespeople are peddling the myth that Fianna Fáil is being punished for taking brave and correct decisions in response to recession.  It should not treat the electorate like fools.  The electorate are angry because they are sophisticated enough to know that the governance of the country in the past four or five years added significantly to the country's woes.  The international recession has contributed to our difficulties, but the management of our economy and financial system and the Government's reliance on a property boom for revenue was utterly irresponsible.  It has resulted in our floundering and trying to deal with a deficit of at least €20 billion this year.  We do not have the capacity to respond as we should to recessionary times by putting in place stimulus packages and creating financial support systems that would create jobs.  It is dishonest of the Government not to recognise the significant mistakes which are making life more difficult for working people and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">It is because of that realisation that people are angry and frustrated and have lost faith in the Government's capacity to deliver recovery.  The public experienced this Government in the past.  People were sold a pup in the past four or five years.  They were given the impression by the Taoiseach himself that the good times would last forever.  They were told we could continue to borrow and spend forever and to invest in property because it would increase in value forever by 5%, 10% or 20% per year.  The Government fuelled that expectation, knowing the boom could not last.  That is why people are angry.  The Government should not spin these facts by claiming it is taking hard and courageous decisions to bring about recovery or that decisions are being taken in the interest of country and not of party.  That is not why the Government is unpopular.  It is nonsense and does not wash with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">We require a national debate on how Ireland should bring about recovery.  That can be facilitated only by a general election.  This would force all parties, including my own, to put their cards on the table and to outline their policies to create jobs, to reduce the deficit and to limit the risk to taxpayers from banks' bad debts.  In the absence of a general election we will not have such a full debate on how Ireland should recover in the next four or five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The political system, like the banking and financial regulatory systems, needs to cleanse itself by getting rid of the people who are responsible for making the mistakes and replacing them with new people who will bring about recovery.  I listen to Ministers rightly attack the way decisions were made in banks in the past five or six years.  They criticise the Financial Regulator for failing to do his job and condemn the relationship between the regulator and the banking system.  All parties make the case that we need to start afresh with new people and structures.  Ministers do not apply the same rationale to politics.  They think it is acceptable for the Minister for Finance to make a hash of last September's budget, requiring 42 changes before Christmas.  He takes no political responsibility for that.  They think it acceptable for the Government to get its projections entirely wrong, to have to bring in emergency budgets and find an extra saving of €4 billion before the end of the year.  There has been no political accountability for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">This is why people are angry.  They have had enough of the hypocrisy of politics and of the Government, which applies different standards to other sectors of the economy which have made mistakes and are suffering the consequences of them.  Those consequences are not suffered by politicians who have, equally, put Ireland in a perilous financial and economic state.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The Taoiseach says he intends to be courageous and to continue along the tough path he has chosen to bring about recovery.  To be courageous would be to go to the country, to put his plan to the test and to force my party and others to do the same.  Let the people choose how Ireland should bring about recovery.  It will not be easy to do.  The nation needs to make sacrifices because of the mistakes we have made in the past, combined with international recession which is also making life difficult.  Irish people will accept hardship and sacrifice if they see it as part of a road to recovery.  They will not put up with hardship if they do not see a plan for recovery as part of the pain process.  They do not see that from the Government.  They do not trust it to bring about that change.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The Government's problem is one of communication and trust, as much as of policy.  Ireland is on the floor.  We must begin by being honest and truthful with people, tell them how bad things are and have a contest of ideas as part of a general election where all parties would present their solutions to the banking, unemployment and deficit crises as well as the crises in the health and education systems.  We must have the courage to go out and do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Government was given a mandate by the people.  It has a constitutional mandate to continue if it wants to.  It does not have a political or moral mandate to continue.  It was elected under totally different circumstances.  We are in a different situation from when the Government was elected.  In 2007, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party presented election manifestoes based on figures which are now fantasy.  We must be honest enough to say that.  We need to start again.  We need a new programme for Government.  We need a Government with a new mandate based on plans of action which parties should be forced to put on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">That kind of renewal cannot happen in the absence of a general election.  Otherwise, even if the Government does not put a step wrong between now and the end of the year, or between now and the end of the Dáil's term, it does not have sufficient political capital or trust to carry off that.  That is the Government's problem.  It is like a manager who has lost the dressing room.  People no longer trust the Government to be able to deliver in difficult times.  For this reason, it is necessary to return to the electorate for a new mandate for a new government. Even if the new Government were led by the Fianna Fáil Party, it would at least have a moral and political mandate to demand sacrifice and pain in the process of bringing about recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Fine Gael Party has ideas and people in whom members of the public will believe.</p>

Are the ESB and Bord Gáis quangos?  Our proposal would result in the establishment of new State companies.  In response to well thought-out, costed and good policy ideas, the Fianna Fáil Party chooses to spin the truth, giving us a flavour of what we can expect from it in opposition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I ask that the point I raise be conveyed to Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The reason Deputies are discussing a motion of no confidence in the Government is that last Friday, when the people of Ireland spoke, only 25% of them voted for Government representatives, while 75% of the electorate across the country rejected members of Government parties at municipal, county, Dáil and European elections.  For this reason, the Fine Gael Party has a responsibility to table a motion of no confidence.  The House must discuss the economy and the reason the electorate rejected Fianna Fáil and the Green Party at the elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The current economic decline is without precedent.  The Great Depression at the end of the 1920s did not compare to what is currently taking place.  While I am not a pessimist, I note that all economic indicators show that Ireland will experience negative growth for a further four years.  The Economist Intelligence Unit, the Economic and Social Research Institute and OECD have all suggested that negative growth in Ireland will continue for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">While I concur with speakers opposite that the Government is not fully to blame for the current crisis, it has contributed to it by having the highest energy costs in Europe.  In addition, the costs of employment in Ireland, as opposed to wages, are among the highest in the industrialised world.  Ireland's loss of competitiveness is evident in many areas.  One of the last remaining manufacturing industries in County Kerry, Beru Electronics in Tralee, is considering whether to relocate to Germany where the costs of employment are much lower than in Tralee.  The migration of manufacturing industries will continue because we have lost our competitive edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Ireland is heavily dependent on American corporations.  While we all welcomed Barack Obama's victory in the presidential election, it is clear the new President's tax policies will have an effect on this country.  I have spoken recently to a number of individuals who are concerned about the threat posed by his proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The Government is borrowing €70 million per day to keep the country afloat.  For how many years must this continue?  Clearly, we will not be able to continue borrowing money at this rate in Europe, especially Germany, and the problem will need to be addressed.  I concur with the Taoiseach that our economic problems must be tackled to establish a platform for future development.  However, the reason we are borrowing €70 million per day is the manner in which this country was managed for a long time.  The Government anticipates annual taxation revenue of €34 billion this year but has reached only 37% of its target almost halfway through the year.  It is possible, therefore, that tax revenue will be below €34 billion this year and we may have to borrow more to keep the country afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Our experience of the economic crisis has been significantly different from that of other countries.  While Government borrowing was minimal for a considerable period, individuals borrowed substantial amounts and Irish banks borrowed large sums on international markets.  Much of Government revenue was, therefore, borrowed money and not the result of sustainable development.  The Taoiseach's statement that the fundamentals were right is inaccurate given the large amount of revenue based on borrowing by individuals and the banks rather than productivity gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I accept the point made by Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, that improvements have been made.  For example, the road system is superior to what it was 15 years ago.  While some improvements are evident, one must also accept that broadband penetration in County Kerry, for example, is abysmal and the county is losing out as a result.  During the recent period of economic prosperity, the Government did not fund a single wastewater treatment system in County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We received some useful statistics today.  Irish households and firms owe almost €400 billion, of which mortgages account for €148 billion, company borrowing accounts for a further €168 billion and credit card debt accounts for nearly €3 billion.  This accumulated debt is crippling.  If the Minister were to walk from the House to Grafton Street, he would see that a large number of retail outlets have closed down.  Many offices and businesses have closed on Merrion Square, a trend reflected throughout the country.  Deputies who canvassed during the local elections will have noted that shops in town centres are closing down daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">It is forecast that 500,000 people may be unemployed by the end of the year.  The ESRI has also forecast that as many as 300,000 people will be made unemployed in 2010 bringing the unemployment figure to as much as 800,000 in two or three years, a frightening prospect.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The reason the Government parties performed so poorly last Friday was that people are not satisfied with their performance.  The bottom line is that people do not have confidence in the Government.  As tough decisions must be made, each party should set out its stall.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Parties should go to the country and ask the people for their verdict.  I am convinced that whenever the Government decides to go to the country, there will be a change of Government.  That is inevitable.  That is why the Government is hanging in there as long as it can just to stay in power.  It should give the people an opportunity, as reflected on Friday last, to express their view at this stage and that is why this motion was tabled.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">Clearly, Deputy Kenny even wrong-footed his colleagues, so-called friends or potential partners in the Labour Party by doing so.  It was an ill-judged move but one I welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Earlier I listened to Deputy Coveney whose premise was that we should govern in good times but, because there are great challenges facing the country, we should cut and run.  Of course the real challenge of any political party, and of any Government, is to face the obstacles, particularly the difficult ones that arise in the type of economic circumstances prevailing, not only nationally but internationally.  It would be an appalling abdication of responsibility if the Government were to succumb on the basis that the two political parties opposite suddenly want an election on the basis of a good day at the office on the local elections.  At the many doors I called to I, my party and the Government received much criticism.  People were hurting, people were losing their jobs, people were seeing their salaries cut and were very upset.  However, one of the striking features of all of the discussions in many households, even those that told me they would vote for Fine Gael, is that if a general election were called, they would not vote for an alternative because there is none.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Deputy Kenny should be aware of the thin ice and the high moral ground on which he is trying to stand in pretending, even in the House today, that somehow the country is about to rush to the saviours that he sees in the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and whoever else — possibly, from his point of view, Sinn Féin — who may coalesce with them because that will not happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">The Opposition should take great care in the way that it has been presenting so-called arguments aided and abetted by others outside the House who have delivered nothing but rhetoric and, indeed, bluster about our economic situation, and the solutions that exist.  It is quite extraordinary that in all of the corrections the Government has taken since the middle of 2008, not one of them has been supported by the parties opposite.  In fact, almost on a weekly basis, they come into the House with the latest ideal of what I can only determine as the sort of kindergarten economics that prevails in the Opposition.  No real substantive solutions are being offered, except to say that they will do it better and the gap in resources will be bridged somehow from savings.  I congratulate Deputies Lee and O'Sullivan on their election and on their arrival into the House today, but I was struck by the direct question asked recently of Deputy Lee, a celebrity economist.  When asked directly where he would deal with the challenges in terms of the reduction in expenditure and tax, he stated Fine Gael will get it from savings.</p>

Sending a continuously negative international message will do nothing to help us to recover economically.  If Opposition Members have something to say, they should set out a policy that offers a coherent approach capable of delivering a sustainable and stable banking system so as that we can grow our way out of our economic difficulties.  However, they have not done so.  I would go so far as to say that some of the remarks made by Deputy Kenny and the leader of the Labour Party have almost been treasonous——</p>

          <p eId="para_868">I will move on to other areas.  Clearly, economic, social and political cohesion are crucial ingredients in regrowing the economy.  No matter what anyone says about savings, the achievement of which is important, we have a pay and pensions bill and a social welfare bill this year of €43 billion.  We will have a tax revenue of approximately €32 billion or €33 billion.  We are borrowing to pay wages and social welfare.  If we stopped all other expenditure, we would still be left with a €10 billion hole in the finances.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_870">There is no point in the Opposition dancing on a pinhead to avoid the reality of what must be challenged.  As the Taoiseach stated in the House today, we have taken more than €8 billion out of the economy.  No other European government has faced up to its responsibility like the Irish Government, a fact that has been acknowledged internationally.  In the December budget, we need to face the substantial challenge of removing further expenditure from the economy because we do not have the income to match it.  We will need to consider the requisite balances.  It is clear that if we revert to the mistakes of the late 1970s and 1980s, we will crucify the country for another generation.  The sooner we face up to taking the pain on the chin and moving on, the sooner we will recover when opportunities arise nationally and internationally.  The Opposition's rhetoric seeks to ignore entirely the change in our tax revenue and expenditure bases.  The sooner that it comes to realise and accept these changes and contributes something substantial to the debate inside and outside the House, the sooner we will be able to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I will refer to an ironic benefit of what is occurring.  In recent years, our competitiveness suffered greatly.  Given the economic crisis, demand and decreasing costs, our competitiveness is improving, which is not bad.  This is evident in the tourism sector, for which I am directly responsible.  Where we were once going out of the market, we are now fighting hard to maintain our tourism base.  We are making substantial investment in the tourism marketing fund and are holding our international market share, albeit in difficult international circumstances.  We are sustaining nearly 300,000 jobs.  While there have been job losses in the sector, the attrition rates witnessed in other countries are worse than our rate.  Our policies, through State agencies, are clearly the right ones if we are to sustain the market.  We can take heart from the fact that post 9/11 and the BSE crisis, we were the first economy to recover and return to the sort of tourism numbers.  We did so in a better way than any of our European competitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">As we look to the future, it is equally clear that we will need to take financial decisions in the next two or three years if we are to demonstrate to the public why pain must be taken now and where recovery will occur.  Doing so is possible.  The classical Labour and Fine Gael rhetoric has surprised me.  I remember the elections of the 1970s and 1980s, but it is extraordinary that the rhetoric has not changed.  As per usual, it is all about smoke and mirrors.  They claim that we do not need to increase taxes, but that we can continue to spend.  At the same time, the Opposition will not identify what we need to do.  I would like to pose some questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">I will tell the House why we should have a general election and a change of Government.  We should have a change of Government because of the neglect of mental health services during this Government's time in office.  It espouses to invest in resources for those suffering from mental illness and has failed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Three years ago, the report on mental health services, A Vision for Change, was adopted as Government policy.  Yet, it has failed to put any resources into the area and has neglected it, despite the fact that one in four people will suffer from a mental illness at some stage of their lives.  Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on Health and Children will launch a report on suicide.  Three years ago, there was a two hour debate in the House on the 33 proposals contained in the committee's report on how to reduce suicide.  Tomorrow, the committee will show that, of the 33 proposals, only seven of them have any reasonable level of implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">This Government will not at any stage, and has no intention of, giving anything but lip service to dealing with those who are seriously mentally ill and in need of community service because of their mental illness and those who are suicidal and self-harming — there are 11,000 who self-harm — and is totally ignoring the fact that 600 people die by suicide every year.  The Government has no interest whatsoever in those issues.</p>

That is its attitude to those who die by suicide, those who attempted suicide, those who are suicidal, the families who suffer the trauma of bereavement by suicide and the organisations who deal with them.  The Minister should not shake his head.  The facts are there.  He does not know them because he is not interested in knowing them.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">In 1984, some 12% of the total health budget was allocated to mental health services.  This year, 6.7% of the total health budget will be allocated to it and the percentage has dropped each year since the Government went into office.  The Government has no interest in or commitment to this area, and will continue to have none.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">During this Government's time in office, we on this side of the House have repeatedly requested funding.  We did not give dramatic speeches as the Minister did.  I ask the Minister sincerely, for the sake of those who suffer from mental health issues, who are suicidal and those bereaved by suicide to go and let another Government deal with the matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_637">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_955">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is, beyond question, time that this Government went.  Clearly, given what the Minister, Deputy Cullen said, it will not go because it is totally out of touch and afraid.  The Minister referred to the need to sort out the banking problems.  We all agree on this and Fine Gael supported the first proposal on banking.  However, when we got some idea of the situation in Anglo Irish Bank, we raised legitimate questions.  That is the job of Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Farmers now have total borrowings of €5.5 billion, an increase of €700 million from last year.  Yet, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, failed to provide the grant aid farmers were promised and guaranteed when they started to work on various schemes.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, failed to allow the farm waste management scheme to proceed past 31 December so farmers could have time to get their jobs done and builders would have opportunities to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">He closed down the building trade and increased the cost to farmers.  Farmers were able to get jobs done for almost half of what they would have cost, but they are not paid.  If farmers had received the money instead of being paid on a 40:40:20 basis, the banks would have been re-financed.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Many farmers are still paying very high rates of interest because they did not think they would have to borrow money on a long-term basis and instead used their overdrafts.  It is a critical situation.  The collapse in beef prices, due to bad management, and the collapse of the dairy industry, which the Government has totally failed to deal with at European level, are crises that affect the whole farming industry.  Deputy Neville referred to problems regarding mental health.  The problems suffered by farmers is causing mental health issues and there have been, and will continue to be, serious consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Regarding cuts in education grants, we all know cuts were needed.  However, how was it that the minority community in this country, which had been looked after in a realistic way since the foundation of the State, had its grants cut?  The only grants which were cut were those provided to Protestant schools.  That was clear and absolute discrimination and there is no justification for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">If one is in a fee paying school, the ratio is one teacher to 20 pupils, compared to one for 19 pupils in other schools.  There are many other issues which I do not have time to go into.  Schools such as the Collegiate in Monaghan, the Royal School in Cavan, Sligo Grammar School, Bandon Grammar School and others have been penalised by this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">There have been cuts funding for special learning, which is against the long-term interests of the children concerned.  There has also been a withdrawal of support from some of the institutions which deal with children who have problems such as cerebral palsy and spina bifida.  I spoke to a parent today who is scared stiff and does not know where their child will go next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Health is the main issue as far as the people of Cavan and Monaghan are concerned.  I do not know how the Government can retain the<b> </b>Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, when she does not represent a party or anything else.  She has no mandate.  She is completely out of touch with reality and spins whatever she thinks is the right thing to do.  She is spending more on spin doctors than on many other sectors of the health service.  Home helps are being taken from people who are more than 90 years of age.  When home helps are on holidays they will not be replaced.  When I raised that matter in the Dáil recently I received an utterly ridiculous answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The situation may be funny for the Ministers who are sitting opposite but it is not funny for the people on the Border.  That area has been completely devastated because of the Government's policies.  We pay 21.5% VAT when it is 15% across the Border.  We pay more for electricity, gas and many other items.  Our costs at Government level are far higher and nothing is being done about it.  The loss in revenue from the movement northwards this year is causing much of the problem.  The Minister for Finance admitted that he had made a mistake in increasing VAT.  Yet, when we had another budget he failed to do anything about it.  I have no confidence in the Government.  The people of Cavan-Monaghan have no confidence in it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has called a third recount to try to save one seat on the county council.  That is an example of the pressure he is under in that area.  It is time the Government went to the country and got a proper mandate.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_638">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_964">The Government has failed to understand why we are debating a confidence motion in it.  I welcome the opportunity to have this debate.  The reason we are having it is that two years ago when the Government was elected it signed a contract with the people to do X, Y and Z.  It made commitments and promises and people accepted them and voted in the Government.  Last Friday people voted in a totally different way.  People went in their thousands to the polling stations and voted against the Government.  In the heartland of Fianna Fáil in my constituency its members got elected by two votes in the last seat in five seaters.  That happened last week because the people were angry and frustrated with the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">If democracy means anything, an election should be called and people should be given an opportunity to have their say because the contract has been broken badly.  Some fine people, including members of Fianna Fáil, lost their seats across the country, not because of their hard work but because of the Government.  That was the reason people in their thousands voted against Fianna Fáil last week.  People no longer want this Government.  In every second household to which I called between Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Cahir and other places across the constituency people were waiting for members of the Government parties because of the Government's mismanagement of the country.  The Government has failed totally to accept the voice of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">A huge number of people are unemployed.  In my constituency alone, 7,699 people are on the live register.  The Government has no plan of action to get us out of the recession.  It has no plan to make necessary improvements to services or to attract tourists to the country at a time when many hotels across the country are closing down.  Two weeks ago I stood outside Tipperary Co-op with 300 angry farmers who are now getting only 17 cent a litre for milk when they were getting 40 cent.  They were frustrated.  The banks are on their backs.  The Government is doing things the people do not want.  If democracy means anything, and if we mean what we say about listening to the voice of the people, we must listen to the people who voted in their thousands against the Government last week.  People would give the Government a chance if it admitted its failure, apologised and said it would do things differently.  However, the Government is not prepared to do that and that is what is killing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Local authorities are strapped for cash.  The roads are in disarray.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism spoke earlier about all the money that was invested in infrastructure.  That will all go to waste because there is no money in any of the local authorities to do their basic work.  The Government is very sure it will win the confidence motion.  If it does, it should do things differently and tell the people that, because that is what they want.  The Government would be reneging on the contract it made if it does not change the way it does its business.</p>

          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_968">The date of 5 June will go down in Fianna Fáil history, not just because of last Friday's elections but also because seven years earlier on that date Fine Gael chose a new leader, Deputy Enda Kenny — a man I was proud to carry out shoulder high on his by-election victory for the Fine Gael Government of the day in 1974.  On the day he was elected leader he made one promise, namely, that he would electrify the Fine Gael party.  I think the Government knows now what he meant.  He did not promise to electrocute the Fianna Fáil Party, it did that itself.  I wish to say a few things today to the gentleman opposite who must be very disillusioned after the elections on 5 June.  It is time to change the captain and the team because the Government has come to the end of the road as far as people are concerned and there is nowhere to go.  The Government does not even know where it wants to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Let me point out the futility of the Government's situation.  If in the forthcoming general election the Fianna Fáil party were to receive the 24% it received in the ballot box last Friday it would have only 40 Members sitting in the next Dáil.  I repeat, there would be only 40 Fianna Fáil Deputies after the general election we are asking the Government to call tomorrow.  Those Deputies who are not re-elected would be joining the other 400,000 people who are on the dole due to the Government's incompetence.  If Fianna Fáil got the vote it received in Dublin Central, Fianna Fáil would have only 20 seats after the next election.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">I thank the Fianna Fáil party for consuming the Progressive Democrats, the remnants of which are now clinging on to the deckchairs.  This week the Green Party is in terminal decline.  I heard the Taoiseach say earlier that he would continue as he has been doing because he will have the confidence of this House.  How can he judge whether he has the confidence of the people when he is being protected from them and them from him?  He came to my constituency two days before the local elections.  His visit to my constituency involved a drop from the sky in a helicopter after which his State car took him to several other destinations.  He met only a select few who are still loyal to the cause in Schull and Bantry before taking flight again into the clouds.  Many people wanted to meet him to discuss issues such as Bantry Hospital.  I remind the Minister that a report today indicated that hospital will now become a referral unit for Cork University Hospital.  How can one call it confidence when one has to hide the leader of this country from people who wanted to meet him to ask about the future of Bantry Hospital?</p>
          <p eId="para_971">I have served the people of west Cork for more than 40 years.  I am a realist and I know that we do not have the numbers on this side to win the vote on this motion tomorrow or to force change.  However, the people opposite have that choice.  While they may not do so today they will have to do it soon.  If the Government walks the plank now it may be possible for it to swim to shore.  If it waits any longer the water will become deeper and much more choppy thus ensuring it will not survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I will conclude with a quote from Abraham Lincoln: "What kills a skunk is the publicity it gives itself".  There is no doubt this Government stinks and the stench is getting stronger with each day.  The Government's time is up.  It should go now before it does more damage.</p>

          <p eId="para_973">I welcome this debate.  I believe it is a good idea to hold a debate like this every now and again so that we can tease out issues in terms of where we should be going.  Mar dúirt mé i mBéarla, tá áthas orm go bhfuil an rún seo curtha síos ag an Rialtas.  Ar ndóigh, tacaím leis an rún go bhfuil muinín againne sa Rialtas agus san obair atá ar bun ag an gCeannaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">I was interested to hear what Members opposite had to say about their leader, Deputy Kenny, a man I know well and whom I admire.  While he lives in a neighbouring county, he lives closer to me than many of my colleagues in Galway city who are Deputies.  I admire Deputy Kenny.  Fine Gael has quite rightly resisted the temptation when called upon by the media time and again to ditch their leader because he is not doing well in the opinion polls.  They have, I believe justifiably — the results speak for themselves — resisted the temptation to dump Deputy Kenny as leader in favour of the myriad of other suggestions put to them by the media.  I can assure Members we are of the same mind.  The captain of our team is a very capable Taoiseach.  We will work with him to ensure renewed growth in this country despite the huge challenges facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">There have been many debates in regard to why this or that was not done in the past.  I came to the conclusion many years ago that one should learn from the mistakes of the past.  I can assure Deputies that any decision made by this Government was made in good faith based on the best information available on any given day.  Much of the debate in this regard reminds me of the tourist who when he asked a man from west Cork the way to Skibbereen was told, "If I were you, I wouldn't start from here".  We have all heard that story.  The reality is that every day we go into Cabinet to make decisions, we are where we are.  Wondering why——</p>

The Government had no choice but to secure the banking system.  Had it not done so every household in the country would have been affected, directly or indirectly.  Anybody who seriously believes that the banking system should not have been saved does not know anything about the complexity of modern financial transactions.

          <p eId="para_991">That is a very good question.  An interesting aspect which nobody appears to be teasing out is that our banks were loaned hundreds of billions of euro by the European banks.  One would have thought that in the commercial world the lender, namely, the European banks, with all of their risk analyses, would have been able to ascertain that they were creating loss situations for themselves.  The obvious question arises as to how it happened that they got it so wrong and managed to buy worthless paper in the US that has no asset backing whatsoever.  I will explain later my understanding of how it happened.  At least what the European banks invested in here, while impaired, are asset backed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">My understanding is that the reason the banks did this is because much of what they off-lay is off-layed a further 50 or 60 steps.  The reality is — this is an issue we need to examine in the context of our banking system — that the situation not alone in Ireland's financial world but the financial world in general had become so complex that nobody really knew where the aggregate risk was.  An issue that needs to be examined not alone in Ireland but worldwide is that of bubble creations by banks and the purchase of worthless assets.  One would have expected that those banks would have had the expertise in risk management to manage their own affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">One of the problems we now face is that people do not want constructive debate.  As I stated, we are where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The second decision, one which in my opinion was a simple and correct one, was the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  If we had not done so the consequences for every man, woman and child in this country would have been unthinkable.  I have listened with interest to the Fine Gael proposal in relation to the good bank-bad bank.  I would like to have time to discuss that issue with those in Fine Gael who are proposing it.  What I do not understand in terms of that proposal is what would secure the money in the bad bank once created.   Will the people in the banks who created the problem continue to manage the assets and, if not, who will do so?  I do not think Fine Gael has fully teased out the logic of its bad bank proposal.</p>

He believed, however, that NAMA would have to ensure it did not pay above value for the assets, with which I agree, and that the people who make the decisions should be completely independent of outside interference, which is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I would love to engage in constructive debates on these issues.  I have never been a politician who spends time scoring small political points because I try to be positive and constructive in creating employment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1028">I thank the Opposition for letting me get my breath back.  Given the significant amount of funding invested in the rural development programme, a debate on how we spend that money would be worthwhile.  We have not yet taken full advantage of the huge opportunities available in rural Ireland and the money will create at least 1,200 front line jobs as well as considerable spin-off employment.  The programme could create confidence for the future in rural communities and a number of people have already come forward with innovative ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">In recent years, there has been a huge increase in rural recreation in Ireland.  It is interesting to note, for example, that Bord Fáilte has indicated that the number of foreign visitors to Ireland who include walking in their activities is at a record high.  Hardly a week goes by in which a group does not invite me to open a new walking route or other rural development.  We have a fine countryside and many natural resources but we have not invested sufficiently in rural recreation projects which would maximise the potential of this industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">As a Galway Deputy, the past several weeks have demonstrated the untapped potential for marine leisure activities.  In the past two weeks, 600,000 people visited Galway for an amazing event.  We should build on that success by developing the marine leisure sector to its full potential.  There are great opportunities along our coasts to create jobs in this sector, and there is no part of Ireland too far from the coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Despite media reports that nobody in the Cabinet has worked in industry, I have worked in both manufacturing and services for many years.  I was involved in setting up manufacturing operations and stores with limited resources and from the bottom up as the manager and first employee of a co-operative.  All during this time, I explored the untapped resources of my area.  This was done at a time when, according to the historians, nothing was happening.  The late 1970s and early 1980s were barren years during which we were building up industries and I was not the only one at it.  I know many people who started businesses in those times.  They saw niches and opportunities that had not been exploited previously and established industries.  I also know that they worked with the statutory agencies but I have to say the help available now far exceeds anything that was available at that time.  Therefore, I believe that part of the employment fightback has to come from motivating by example, discussion and debate, opening up new sectors, having national plans for such issues as rural recreation and tourism and marine leisure, and motivating individuals to invest and develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The recent Volvo race in Galway was a perfect example of what statutory agencies and people with vision can achieve.  We have to go along this route.  Talking ourselves down all the time makes people dispirited whereas showing realistic opportunities creates sustainable employment.  Many of the industries established in the 1980s survived and grew in all parts of the country.  They were established by people who did not lie down when it got tough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">I fully recognise that people are hurting.  I realise that it is not easy for public servants to take an effective drop in wages through the pension services levy.  I particularly empathise with those who are made unemployed.  To be true to those people, we have to work to restore balance in the Government finances and create employment at the same time.  I am determined to maximise my resources to achieve these objectives.  I know all other Ministers are working in a coherent manner in the same direction with the resources they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">We have heard much from Fine Gael, which wants major cutbacks but it never tells us from where.  Its Members come to the Estimates debates but never tell the Minister he or she is wasting money; all they ever ask is whether more could be spent on the various programmes.  This is a pity.  If Fine Gael really believes there are many savings to be made, it is time it spelled out where are the 5,000 they will let go from the public service.  I am more aligned with the Labour Party on this issue than I am to Fine Gael.  I do not know too many public servants who do not have a job of work to do.  I know public servants who go way beyond the call of duty to do their work and who do an honest day's work.  I know some public servants who perhaps do not perform as they should but I do not know of many jobs in the public service that are surplus to requirement.  I am very anxious that if Fine Gael has a policy of letting public servants go that it spells out where all these surplus jobs are because every time there is a cutback the Fine Gael party, which wants major cutbacks, tells us not to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">One of the most recent interesting proposals from Fine Gael was to abolish the integrated Leader partnership companies we established throughout the country.  They are stand alone companies with partnership boards and strong community representation which deliver a wide range of programmes.  I agree there was a need to rationalise and we reduced the number of companies from 94 to 54.  We also made the local development social inclusion programme nationwide and gave it charge of the rural social scheme and Leader companies.  I would not agree with Fine Gael's proposal to abolish all of these companies, take away local empowerment and put them under the aegis of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">This is the wrong way to go.  Local authorities would be better focusing on their existing areas of operation and ensuring the work they do there is done well rather then becoming so multi-functional that they become like an octopus with so many arms that it is impossible for ordinary people to interact with them and to get the community buy-in that we have in the integrated companies.  However, I accept that Fine Gael is of a different view and I would be very interested in debating with its Members at committee meetings and teasing out these issues.  Perhaps there is merit in their views but I cannot see it to be honest.  However, I am of an open mind and if the Opposition comes up with good ideas, I am never averse to taking them as Deputies Ring and Wall know.  If I disagree I will also say so.  We can all learn from each other in this interaction and progress the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">I wish to share time with Deputy Seán Sherlock who will speak tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Acting Chairman never said a truer word than that the Minister's time was up and not only for this Minister but the whole lot of them.  Unfortunately, they will win the vote of confidence tomorrow not because the people who normally sit behind the Minister, the Green Party Members who occasionally come to the House, the two left-over Members of the Progressive Democrats and the couple of Independent Members who are hanging in there have confidence in the Government, but because they are terrified to face the statistic quoted by the very wise Deputy P. J. Sheehan, who spoke about the 24% of the vote that Fianna Fáil got and the fact that they would return after a general election with 40 Deputies.  That is why the Government will win the vote of confidence tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I listened to two Ministers speaking this evening and the second was slightly more realistic than the first, but not by much.  The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, was in a state of complete denial.  He came in and gave a load of bluster and guff and that is precisely why the people have no confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government it leads.  The Minister who is still in the House blamed the international banks for the fact that the banks in Ireland are in trouble.  He then blamed the Opposition, but I did not hear any blame falling on the Government and that is precisely the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The Bible says not to worry about the mote in the eye of everybody else but to look at the beam in one's own eye.  The problem is that the Government is not looking at the beam in its own eye.  I was listening to Deputy Mattie McGrath on Newstalk on my way up here today and he expressed the real fear and views of the backbenchers.  I do not know whether he will come to the House and repeat what he said about the Taoiseach on air today.  It is not that they have confidence in the Government, but that they are terrified of the consequences of not voting in favour of the motion tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, said we are where we are and spoke about the fellow in west Cork who said to the tourist looking for directions, "I wouldn't start from here", but we have been led up the highways and byways for the past 12 years to precisely where we are now.  Twelve years ago we were much closer to where we want to be in that we were creating 1,000 jobs a week.  Deputy Ruarí Quinn was the Minister for Finance and previously the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The Irish economy was functioning very well.  We were in the black, not in the red, but we are where we are because we have been led here by the Minister's party.  We must get real about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">We must also get real about the Opposition's plans and proposals.  We have put forward many proposals but the Minister has not listened to them or has not been interested.  He criticised us for not having any proposals but then proceeded to dissect one or two of the proposals he has heard from the Opposition.  On the one hand he is saying we do not have any proposals and on the other he is saying our proposals are wrong or that Fine Gael and Labour do not agree with each other.</p>

Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  If, however an employer is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement to the employee, my Department will, upon submission by the employer of satisfactory documentary evidence proving inability to pay, make payment directly to the employee from the Social Insurance Fund.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department has received an application from the individual concerned but is awaiting the submission from the employer of satisfactory documentation proving inability to pay.  Once this is received, and if it is in order, the claim will be processed for payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1126">Following the recent receipt from Forfas and my officials of their further analysis into the possible provision of a State supported Export Credit Insurance Scheme and discussions with my Government colleagues, I have instructed my Department to initiate an accelerated tendering process for the purposes of carrying out forensic due diligence on the credit insurance market in Ireland. This due diligence will include an in-depth examination of the client databases of the main credit insurance providers operating in Ireland and will assess whether there is market failure.  If market failure is confirmed, the level and nature of any such market failure will be quantified.  The due diligence will also assess the costs and impacts of possible intervention of the State in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">The economic downturn has seen a huge acceleration in the number of companies forced to take measures to cut staff costs including that of making staff redundant.  The unprecedented level of redundancies is placing huge demands on the Redundancy Payments Section of the Department in that, in the first five months of 2009 alone, the claims received represent also 88% of the total amount lodged in 2008 (40,607).  This is significant in that 2008 was itself a year that saw a significant increase in claims when compared with previous years (2002-2007) during which the annual intake of claims averaged at 24,590.  The number of claims received is now averaging in excess of 1,800 per week as against an average weekly level of less than 500 up to 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">While the significantly increased demands now placed on my Department presents huge challenges, I am equally acutely aware of the difficulties which the current temporary inability to process redundancy payments as quickly as we would like is giving rise to for individuals and the business community.  A number of steps have already been taken and these are under constant review.  Measures taken to date include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">the reassignment of 21 staff additional staff from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands;</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA);</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website.  Currently the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is dealing with rebate claims submitted on-line in December and those submitted manually in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">This is enabling the staff in the Redundancy Payments area to concentrate on and prioritise the processing of redundancy payment claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">I have also been very concerned about the issue referred to in the Deputy's question about offsetting redundancy rebates due to employers against outstanding tax liability and I have taken measures to deal it.  My Department has engaged with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate businesses experiencing particular difficulties in meeting tax payment obligations because of a delay in receiving rebate repayments from the Department.  Where agreement is forthcoming with the employer and, subject to satisfactory evidence being provided of the repayment due and its quantum, Revenue will be accommodating in deferring for a reasonable period collection or enforcement action that would otherwise ensue in the event of delayed payment of tax.</p>

Smaller SMEs are defined as those that use under 20 Megawatt hours of electricity annually.  Approximately 60% of the ESB's Small and Medium Enterprise customers fall under this category.  Energy costs in Ireland for larger Small and Medium Enterprises, constituting a minority of Irish SMEs, are between 18% and 52% higher than the EU average.</p>

Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  In general, a redundancy situation exists where an employee's job no longer exists.  It is up to the employer concerned to determine whether or not there is in fact a redundancy situation.  Disputes in this regard can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.  It should be noted that an employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing of employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">IDA Ireland has been in contact with the company which advises that for the past month, it has held an internal ‘Career Planning Fair', where all of its businesses presented career opportunities in each business unit, to all employees who might be interested in a career move. Global Services was one of those recruiting and some employees have chosen to move.  Some of those moving were from HP's Inkjet Manufacturing operation, where, due to the transformation and up-skilling of its business, it requires different skills. The company has confirmed that it will now be backfilling those positions with up to 100 new hires.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">More generally, statutory redundancy is an employment right and is paid to workers whose employment has been terminated because the job they were employed to do no longer exists. The current rate for statutory redundancy stands at two weeks pay per year of service plus a bonus week subject to a ceiling of  €600 per week. Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the employer. Disputes between employers/ employees in relation to redundancy or payment of statutory redundancy entitlements may be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for adjudication and determination.  Payment of amounts other than statutory amounts is a matter between the employer and employees and the making of or entitlement to ex gratia payments is not within the remit of my Department.</p>

Accordingly, there is no contractual commitment on the OPW to purchase the site.  Given the elapse of time, and bearing in mind the change in market conditions over the last 12 months, the question of whether the terms agreed still represent value for money will have to be reviewed.  In the meantime, the Department of Finance has recently been approached by a community group in Kiltimagh, Co. Mayo, which has already completed a building in the town.  This building is currently being assessed by the Office of Public Works.  No decision has been taken at this stage on either option.</p>

            <p eId="para_1318">As the Deputy will be aware, it was announced on 29 May that the Government had decided, subject to EU approval, to provide up to €4bn in capital to Anglo Irish Bank. This decision was taken in a context of disappointing six-month financial results for Anglo, reflecting a marked deterioration in asset quality at the bank. The injection of up to €4bn is necessary to ensure Anglo can meet its total capital requirements in the light of the results. The Government's overriding concern in taking this decision has been to protect the economy from the wider losses that would occur in the event of the failure of the bank; to protect the €64bn of deposits in the bank; and, to prevent the bank becoming a systemic threat to the financial system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">This capital injection will represent the first time that money has been put into Anglo, although the Government had signalled its readiness to do so last December before the bank was nationalised.

            <p eId="para_1328">With regard to the VAT on band equipment, the VAT rate applicable to the supply of band equipment is the standard rate of 21.5%.  In matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services I am constrained by the requirements of EU law with which Irish law must comply.  As band equipment is not listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive the reduced VAT rate cannot be applied to those goods. With regard to the VAT on bands, performances in the state by a band established in the state are a taxable activity for VAT purposes and VAT is charged at the standard rate.  The band must register and account for VAT if the turnover from its activities exceeds an annual threshold of €37,500.  In the case of performances outside the State, there is no Irish VAT chargeable, but the band may be liable to register and account for VAT on performances in other Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">There are no plans to review the rate of VAT applying to the performance of a band, especially given that admission to such performances are for the most part exempt from VAT, which is not the case in many other EU Member States.  A VAT registered band can claim VAT input credit in respect of allowable goods and services used by it in connection with supplies it makes both within and outside the state.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Where a band not established in the state supplies performance services to a person acting in a private capacity in the State, then the band must register and account for VAT at 21.5% on all supplies of such services it makes in the State. No registration threshold applies in such cases.  Where a band not established in the State supplies performance services to a person acting in a business capacity in the State, including an agent or promoter, then that person, agent or promoter will be deemed to be the person supplying the services and must register and account for any VAT due on such services. Again no registration threshold applies in such cases.</p>

The draft report was discussed at a meeting between Kilkenny County Council (KCC) and OPW officials at a meeting held on 4 June 2009 when further details and clarifications were sought prior to a final report being accepted.  It is expected that the final report will be available from the Consultant in early July 2009.  A further meeting between KCC and OPW officials will be arranged shortly thereafter to discuss the final report and its recommendations, with a view to determining what solutions are viable, and deciding on the development and prioritisation of flood alleviation measures.</p>

However if another person, such as a daughter or son, has authority to operate an individual's bank account on his or her behalf, and is named as an account holder for this purpose only, the individual will continue to qualify for the refund provided that his or her beneficial ownership of the account is not affected.  In the circumstances set out in the question the pensioner should, when making the DIRT refund claim to Revenue, include a declaration that he/she is beneficially entitled to all of the interest paid in respect of the deposit.

            <p eId="para_1356">A core objective of the legislative and regulatory framework for Credit Unions in Ireland is to ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions.  This requires prudent lending and investment decisions by Boards of credit unions to safeguard members' savings.  The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, are an important asset and liability tool for credit unions as the funding of credit unions is predominantly provided on a short term basis in the form of on-demand savings and consequently the limits on longer term-term lending are necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">I am aware that credit unions are seeking to facilitate revised repayment instalments for credit union members currently experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances but that these endeavours, in certain circumstances, run up against the current Section 35 limits on longer-term lending.  Subject to the over-arching considerations that the financial position of a credit union, the security of members' savings and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is maintained, it should be possible to explore all reasonable steps to allow a member, in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances, to re-schedule their repayments to a level which is affordable to them. Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist, and where members are in difficulty the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">I have asked my Department to reconvene the Group, representative of stakeholders, the Regulatory Authority and my Department, which successfully reviewed the Section 35 lending limits in 2006. The mandate for this Group will be to find a solution to this complex issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1366">An ARF (Approved Retirement Fund) is an investment vehicle into which certain individuals can invest the proceeds of their pension plans. An ARF offers such individuals considerable flexibility and freedom as regards when they draw income in retirement and acts, in that regard, as an alternative to a retirement annuity which provides a regular income stream for life. In common with annuity income, draw-downs from ARFs are subject to taxation at the ARF owner's marginal rate of income tax. This was always the intention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets in an ARF on 31 December each year, with the notional amount taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. The level of imputed distribution at 3% is not considered excessive, given that ARFs are intended to provide an income stream in retirement for their owners and generous tax relief is provided on the contributions to, and growth of, pension funds the proceeds of which are invested in ARFs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The notional distribution was introduced following an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 (published in 2006) which found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement, but instead was being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs as planned. It is not unreasonable that there should be an expectation that the benefits from these funds will be subject to tax at some point. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in a year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for that year, although there is no compulsion to draw funds from the ARF so long as the tax due on the notional distribution is paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">The 3% rate was phased in over a transitional period commencing in 2007, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% in 2009 and each subsequent year. The new regime applies to ARFs created on or after 6 April 2000 where the ARF holder is 60 years of age or over for the whole of a tax year. This provision does not impact on Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs).  Given the rationale for the introduction of the measure, I have no plans at this time to make changes to the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs.</p>

         the mechanisms available to a person who has issues or problems surrounding the information on their P45 regarding the date of commencement of employment and the date of leaving; the way a person can seek to readdress such an issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1377">I  am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a correctly completed form P45 is required, under PAYE regulations, to be given by an employer to an employee on cessation of employment. The form P45 is a notification to Revenue that an employee has ceased employment with that employer. The form also contains details of the employee's pay, tax and PRSI contributions from the start of the year to the date of cessation of employment. The P45 will show the date of commencement of that employment if the period of employment commenced since 1st January in the current tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">If an employee does not get a form P45 when leaving, or the form is incorrectly completed, he or she should ask the employer for a correct P45 and repeat the request if necessary. If the employer still fails to provide a correct P45, the employee should notify their local Revenue office by telephone, email or in writing that they have failed, after several attempts, to get a correct P45 and stating what the problem is. The matter will then be followed up quickly by Revenue with the employer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1440">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that vehicles that are seized by Revenue Officers on the grounds of evasion of VRT are dealt with in the following manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">Where the seized vehicle meets the conditions governing local release that have been set down by the Commissioners, the seizing officer will calculate the VRT and the penalty due and will notify the person concerned accordingly. The vehicle is released once the penalty and the VRT due have been paid. In certain circumstances the owner may be allowed a short period of time to register and pay the VRT due. In other circumstances, the details of the case are reported to the Revenue VRT Prosecution Unit, which considers an appropriate course of action, including whether the vehicle should be retained as a seizure and/or whether proceedings should be instituted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">Where the seized vehicle is likely to be held by Revenue for a short period of time pending its release, it is normally kept in short term official storage facilities that are located in various parts of the country where local enforcement units are based.  Most vehicles that are not to be released in the short term, are removed for storage at the State Warehouse in Dublin pending the final outcome of the case. Such vehicles are normally driven from the local station to the State Warehouse and are not used otherwise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1444">Cohabitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of income tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p>

            <p eId="para_1447">There is no provision in tax law to allow relief for expenses relating specifically to dyslexia treatment or instruction.  However, in recent years the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities.  In 2005, approval was given for the Department of Education and Science to move from individual allocation of resource teaching support for children with special needs, on foot of a psychological assessment, to an approach whereby all mainstream primary schools are allocated resources based on their enrolment without the need for individual psychological assessments for the high incidence categories of need, such as dyslexia and mild general learning disability.  In all, it is projected that, of the total budget of the Department of Education and Science of almost €9.5 billion, over €1 billion is allocated across services for special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.</p>

            <p eId="para_1458">The Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment is not a complete embargo on the filling of all posts in the Civil Service.  It allows me, as Minister for Finance, to sanction the filling of vacancies where the business case for continuity of service so requires.  Having considered issues arising in connection with a Supreme Court case concerning the translation of statutory instruments into Irish I decided as an exceptional measure to sanction the filling of a post of head of translation unit and five other translation posts in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in accordance with the agreed Government strategy.  I have ensured, by means of a staff levy on the main Departments and Offices producing statutory instruments, that there will be no addition to the overall total of Civil Service numbers.  There will be a review of the new translation unit at the end of the first nine months of operation and the staff requirement will be addressed at that stage.  The translation unit, Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, attached to the Houses of the Oireachtas primarily deals with the quite separate issue of the translation of Acts of the Oireachtas into Irish, but not with the translation of statutory instruments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1485">The HSE service plan for 2009, which was approved by the Minister for Health &amp; Children on 9 December 2008, envisages that Child and Family service provision in 2009 will be in line with that provided in 2008. In her letter of approval, the Minister asked the Board and management of the HSE to pay particular attention in 2009 to the absolute necessity for the HSE to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation in delivering, at minimum, the levels of service specified in the service plan.  I will be working with the HSE to try to ensure that provision of these important services to some of the most vulnerable members of our society can be maintained at existing levels notwithstanding the ongoing  budgetary adjustments aimed at restoring balance to the public finances. Implementation of the service plan will be monitored formally throughout 2009 by means of regular monitoring reports to the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">As regards human resource issues I would point out that social workers are exempted from the Government's moratorium on recruitment.  In addition, proposals for an ICT system to support social work services for children has received HSE approval and is with the Department of Finance for review.  If approved, the objective is to have this system operating as quickly as possible to enable better exchange of information and improved communication between relevant staff throughout the HSE.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_1488">My Office is continuously working to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks that will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.  Our aim is to support and protect the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided and prospective parents.  A number of regions of the Health Service Executive were recently listed by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science as having failed to provide them with post-placement reports.  As the Deputy is aware, post-placement reports are a requirement of a number of countries that send children to be adopted by Irish applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">While the Health Service Executive continues to facilitate the preparation of post-placement reports, it has no statutory function in relation to the provision of same.  The key commitment given is the legal affidavit to co-operate with the provision of such reports that is required by the Russian Government from all applicants.  Where parents do not co-operate, there is no legal basis to enforce their co-operation with post-adoption reporting in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">My Office was in touch with the Health Service Executive to clarify the situation in relation to any such list of outstanding reports as soon as this matter was raised.  The Executive confirmed that reports continue to be supplied from all regions and that it was following up in respect of reports that may be completed but not yet transmitted.  Over 450 such reports were required in respect of 2008, and it is anticipated that around 400 will be required in respect of 2009 (not all due yet).  Officials from my Office raised the matter with the Russian Embassy at a recent meeting.  The Russian side has provided a list of outstanding post-placement reports.  This list, which was collated by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science, is currently being validated by the Embassy.  In the meantime, I asked the relevant authorities to assist me in pursuing the resolution of this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">An extensive examination of the list of alleged "missing" post-placement reports has been carried out by the Adoption Board and the Health Service Executive.  While I await final numbers, it appears that the list supplied by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science is inaccurate.  In short, the majority of the outstanding reports (which are estimated to be around 30) have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the Social Workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.  In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their Social Worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">1229 children from the Russian Federation have had their names entered into the Register of Foreign Adoptions in the period 1991 — 2008. This equates to approximately 5,000 post placement reports.  Of the total number of reports required, just over one half of one per cent have not been transmitted to the Russian authorities. Despite the current difficulties, I believe these statistics make it clear that the vast majority of parents are complying with the commitment which they gave to co-operate with such reports and are being fully assisted in doing so by the HSE and the Adoption Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">Officials have indicated to the Russian side the importance that we are attaching to resolving the matter.  Once finalised, the Adoption Board has advised that it will contact the Russian authorities with the validated list.  The Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board have already contacted any families where reports are outstanding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1496">I propose to takes Questions Nos. 138 and 180 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">My Office is continuously working to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks that will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.  Our aim is to support and protect the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided and prospective parents.  A number of regions of the Health Service Executive were recently listed by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science as having failed to provide them with post-placement reports.

The key commitment given is the legal affidavit to co-operate with the provision of such reports that is required by the Russian Government from all applicants.  Where parents do not co-operate, there is no legal basis to enforce their co-operation with post-adoption reporting in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">My Office has been in touch with the Health Service Executive to clarify the situation in relation to any such list of outstanding reports.  The Executive has confirmed that reports continue to be supplied from all regions and that it is following up in respect of reports that may be completed but not yet transmitted.  Over 450 such reports were required in respect of 2008, and it is anticipated that around 400 will be required in respect of 2009 (not all due yet).  The Health Service Executive in all ten areas listed by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science has conducted an extensive search for these alleged "missing" post-placement reports.  The majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the Social Workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">I have dealt with this matter in some detail in the House.  I must emphasise that there is no evidence that there is a backlog on post-placement reports in respect of the Russian Federation and that the numbers of alleged "missing" reports is not substantiated by the investigation under way.  I believe that in the vast majority of cases parents are complying with the commitment which they gave to co-operate with such reports and are being fully assisted in doing so by the HSE and the Adoption Board.  I must also acknowledge that, in a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their Social Worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">With regard to the issue of inter-country adoptions between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, as the Deputy is aware, the Government is presently working towards securing a strengthened intercountry adoption agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.  There has been on-going dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities — with the focus on achieving the requisite strengthening of procedures for the protection of children.  All options, including an interim agreement, are actively being pursued to allow for the conclusion of discussions on a strengthened bilateral agreement and to facilitate continuity of the strong and positive relationship between both jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">I am anxious to conclude discussions on the text of the inter-country adoption agreement already under consideration.  However, that is not to say that any guarantee can be provided in relation to the outcome of that process.  In addition, it must be pointed out that the wider policy agenda priority is the enactment of the Adoption Bill and the subsequent ratification of the Hague Convention.  The agreement must have regard to these forthcoming changes in our national adoption legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability are governed by the Adoption Act, 1991.  Under its provisions, a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is only valid for 12 months.  However, the Adoption Board may grant an extension for a further period if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proper to do so having regard to any material changes to the living circumstances of the applicants.  This procedure applies to all countries equally.  The provisions contained in the Adoption Bill, 2009, allow for a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to be valid for 24 months, with the possibility of a further 12-month extension — subject to the discretion of the Adoption Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1520">I propose to takes Questions Nos. 144, 145, 179 and 276 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">In common with all hospitals, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin is addressing the challenge of delivering a high quality service to its patients, while remaining within budget.  The Hospital is committed to providing the full level of services that it promised in its service plan for 2009.  The top priority will be to protect patient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">So far this year, Crumlin Hospital has delivered more treatments to patients than for the same period last year. In the first four months of 2009 there were 3,704 treatments for children as in-patients and 5,095 as day cases– up by 234 over 2008.  Crumlin also had 28,040 attendances at the out-patient department for the first four months.  The allocation to Crumlin for 2009 is €139.6m, an increase of some 39% over the last five years.  This includes a reduction of 3% this year over 2008, in line with the budgetary contraints facing the entire public sector and the wider economy.  A particular challenge for the Hospital is that it is currently operating at some 91 posts above its employment ceiling — it employed 1,641 people (wholetime equivalents) at the end of April compared with its ceiling of 1,550.  This is contributing to its current financial difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">The HSE is working closely with Crumlin Hospital to achieve an agreed programme of savings, totalling €6.5m this year.  The focus of these savings will be on non-pay areas of expenditure and on protecting front-line services.  On this basis, the HSE believes that the Hospital will achieve a break-even position this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">I believe that we need to look more strategically at the way in which we provide paediatric services in Dublin.  In 2009 the Government will provide over €250m for the running of three paediatric hospitals in Dublin — Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.  We can achieve significant cost savings if services and practices are more closely integrated across the three hospital sites, even before the new National Paediatric Hospital has been completed.  With this in mind, the HSE is pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.  The HSE has been asked to respond directly to the Deputy on the service issues raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1540">I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 201 and 205 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">The fundamental objective of Government health policy is to achieve the best possible health status for the population.  The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services are delivered efficiently and effectively.   Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.  The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised in particular regions.  These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services in the regions concerned, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, and surgical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The first phase of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the HSE  Mid West involves the reorganisation of the arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh so that these hospitals provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure.  This took effect on the night of 6/7 April.  In the context of the re-configuration process, the level of staffing of the ambulance services in Clare and North Tipperary has been enhanced and an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is also now in operation. Advanced paramedics are trained to a standard which equips them to provide more complex pre-hospital care than other personnel.  This includes the administration of a wider range of drugs and the urgent assessment and treatment of patients with life threatening conditions.  Protocols are in place to ensure that all trauma, paediatric and obstetric emergency cases brought directly to the major tertiary centre at Limerick Regional Hospital rather than to Ennis or Nenagh.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The Government is committed to a process of change which is incremental and which involves appropriate consultation and discussion with those affected.  The HSE is proceeding on this basis.  I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the provision of safe and effective health services to the people of the Mid West region. My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputies in relation to the matters that they have raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">European medicines legislation was changed in October 2005 to introduce explicit requirements for Braille to appear on the packaging of medicines.  This legislation also requires pharmaceutical companies to ensure that the patient information leaflets for their medicines are made available, on request from patients' organisations, in formats appropriate for the blind and partially sighted.  This legislation requires that the name (and in some cases the strength and the pharmaceutical form) of the medicine is expressed in Braille on the product packaging, allowing for the improved differentiation of medicines by blind and partially sighted people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">These new Braille provisions became effective across the EU in October 2005 and are being phased in over a five year period.  This means that, by October 2010, all packs of medicines on the market in Ireland that may be given to patients will carry Braille on their packaging, and all pharmaceutical companies that market authorised medicines in Ireland must ensure that the patient information leaflets for their medicines are available, on request, in formats that are suitable for the blind and partially sighted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with several amendments since. In January 2008, the European Commission proposed a new regulation to update and harmonise this legislation. While it is not proposed to include braille on food labels, there is broad support, at working group level, for improvements to the presentation of information on food labels, including the introduction of a minimum 1.2mm text size and ensuring a significant contrast between the printed text and the background of the label. These improvements will be of benefit to the partially-sighted.</p>

The HRB has worked closely with the Medical Research Charities Group to (a) increase the amount of funding available to support research projects relevant to charities and specifically for rare diseases and (b) develop a research management capacity among research charities. To date, very few grant applications dealing exclusively with Friedrich's Ataxia have been received by the HRB, and none has been successful.</p>

The general catchment area for Tallaght Hospital incorporates both St Vincent's University Hospital and St James's Hospital, and the transfer of services from Tallaght will take place in a coordinated way to these two designated centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">Symptomatic breast disease services are the first to be transferred. The NCCP has overseen a detailed planning process with Tallaght Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital. The resources that will be transferred have been identified and the designated centres have completed a capacity equipping plan that ensures they are able to receive additional referrals from GPs in the Tallaght catchment area. It is expected that the transfer will take place within the next couple of months.  Only initial diagnosis and surgery are transferring from Tallaght.  Medical oncology services will continue to be provided at Tallaght as part of a regional network of medical oncology for the Dublin-Mid Leinster area. The oncology day ward opened by me in June 2006 will continue to operate.</p>

It is against this background that the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks that will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption. Its aim is to support the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided and to protect prospective parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">A family that wishes to adopt should be recognised beforehand as being able to promote, safeguard and support the development and well-being of a child in need of adoption in a lasting manner.  However, it is acknowledged that persons applying for inter-country adoption are experiencing delays as regards waiting times for assessment, and that there are also concerns regarding the standardisation of the service across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">It should be noted that the increasing numbers of children adopted from abroad create additional pressures on inter-country adoption teams within the Health Service Executive.  This is because these same teams provide post-adoption reports to the sending countries, at the request of those countries, and with the agreement of the adoptive parents.  This is an important component in the willingness of countries to consider Irish applicants for adoption.  It must also be acknowledged that the Health Service Executive's Child Welfare and Protection Services must continue to be the priority in managing the overall resources available to the Executive in respect of all of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">It is also important to note that, following the assessment process, if successful, applicants must then wait before receiving a referral for a child from the sending country.  The waiting times for referral are outside the jurisdiction of both the Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board and are dependant on the regulations that each individual country has with regard to inter-country adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">At a practical level, the development of standards for the assessment of applicants for inter-country adoption has been advanced through the conjoint working of the Adoption Board, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Health Service Executive.  This work was based on a report commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and submitted to Government in June, 1999, entitled "Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures".  The standardised framework which emerged from that process in 2000 was founded on evidence-based practice and developed with the assistance of international agencies in the field.  The implementation of this framework is continually under review by all parties as inter-country adoption practice and experience continues to evolve and with particular regard to the new statutory framework likely to emerge from the recently published Adoption Bill, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The Bill, which has now passed all stages in the Seanad, provides for a new regime for the accreditation of a range of agencies providing adoption services. This modernised regime more fully recognises the phenomenon of inter-country adoption and makes provision for the accreditation of agencies to provide both assessment services or mediation services.  The Bill also proposes changes to the regulation of the activities, management and financial arrangements of such agencies. If enacted, there will be opportunity for the development of new agencies to assist in the reduction of waiting times in those areas where the waiting times are longest.</p>

            <p eId="para_1657">In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government has decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The decision will apply to all grades of permanent and temporary staff, including nursing, notwithstanding a number of specific exemptions, some of which are highlighted below. A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.  The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.  The number of permanent nursing posts and temporary posts in each of the Health Service Executive acute public hospitals is a service matter and has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.   The principle behind the legislation is to ensure that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.   The Directive also makes provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.   This matter remains under consideration at European Commission level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">The legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).

However, I am also advised that they should not be used to compensate for a poor diet.  My Department is committed to ensuring that all supplements on sale in Ireland are safe in terms of the amount of vitamins and minerals they provide and this informs our approach to ongoing discussions in Europe to agree maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>

The HSE no longer takes applications under the old scheme, however, it continues to process outstanding applications received before August 2008.  In this regard an allocation of €3.5m was made by my colleague Minister Finneran to the HSE recently to deal with these cases.  The Executive has confirmed that it does not have an application from the individual referred to by the Deputy before this cut-off date and therefore I would suggest that he apply directly to his local authority under the new scheme.</p>

The number of persons on a GP's patient panel may not exceed 2,000, save in exceptional circumstances.  In some cases, a GP may decide not to accept an eligible person onto their list, the principal reason being where they already have a significant patient panel and coping with any additional workload would cause them difficulty.  In a small number of cases, a GP may ask to have a patient who is placing excessive demands on the GP's time, and thus impacting on the GP's ability to provide a service to other patients, removed from his/her panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Where a GP requests the HSE to arrange for the removal of a patient from his / her GMS list, he / she must give where requested the reason, in confidence, for such a request to a medical officer acting on behalf of the Executive.

If the Deputy is aware of any particular case where a GP is excluding a patient from his / her GMS panel, he may wish to refer the details to the HSE for investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1718">During January to August 2010, to take account of the fact that some pre-school services currently accommodate a greater number of children than they have daily places for, transitional arrangements will apply.  These will facilitate these services and the children attending them in that they may continue to accommodate children on a pro-rata basis and receive a capitation grant set by reference to the number of children attending each day rather than the total number of children in a week.  However, from September 2010, services participating in the scheme will be required to provide full rather than pro-rata pre school year places.  Parents will be encouraged to avail of the free pre-school year on the basis of full attendance and participating services will be required to give priority to parents using the service on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">It is expected that the majority of the almost 5,000 existing private and voluntary pre-school services currently in operation, will participate in the scheme.  Many of these will have already received capital grant aid under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and or the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  More than 65,000 additional childcare places, many of which are playschool sessional places, will have been created by the end of 2010 as a result of this investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">I am aware from representations received from pre-school services in recent months that many are currently reporting vacancy rates of up to 25% in their facilities and I also understand that a number of people are considering setting up a pre-school service as the new scheme will allow them a degree of certainty which exists in very few areas of economic life today.  In addition, many services which up to now have operated in the mornings only, citing lack of demand for an afternoon session, are now considering offering an additional session to meet an increase in local demand.  As I said at the time of the announcement, some instances of under-supply may arise in the initial period of implementation of the scheme, however my Office and the city and County Childcare Committees will monitor the situation carefully, to maximise the beneficial impact of the scheme for parents and children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1722">Since the Supreme Court Decision of July 2008 that found the previous risk equalisation scheme to be ultra vires, my Department, the Health Insurance Authority and other interests in the Irish private health insurance market have met to discuss the creation and development of a replacement scheme to support the principles of community rating and intergenerational solidarity. The Supreme Court did not find against the principle of risk equalisation. Submissions have also been received regarding the development of a new scheme from a number of interested parties.  The Health Insurance Authority will begin a consultation process in relation to the new scheme in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Following the Supreme Court judgement the Health Insurance Authority noted that there was an urgent need for measures to protect the interests of consumers in a community rated market to address the fact that as persons get older they become more unprofitable for insurers and in the absence of any intervention the overall effect would be that on average older people would pay higher premiums for health insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Given the importance of protecting the market and supporting the principles of community rating, intergenerational solidarity and recognising the higher costs that arise for older age groups, the Government decided that interim measures, as announced on 19th November need to be put into place in order to support community rating until such time as the new scheme is put in place. It is anticipated that they will remain in place for the next three years.   These measures are set out in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">The interim solution consists of two distinct elements: an age-related private health insurance relief provided to individuals who hold private health insurance policies which aims to secure a health policy objective of achieving inter-generational solidarity in terms of assisting individuals to meet their health insurance costs on the basis of age and a levy charged on health insurance companies. This Bill also provides for additional measures that will enhance consumer protection and increase the regulatory powers and functions of the Health Insurance Authority.</p>

The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which was established in May, 2007. The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion and commissioning in 2014.  The new hospital will be based at the Mater Hospital and will include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght which is to open in advance of the new hospital.  This Centre will offer a wide range of services including urgent care consultations, outpatient services and day surgery.  This will ensure that many children who do not require admission can continue to access care locally.</p>

The commencement process for the Act was planned as being a three stage process in view of the complexity and number of new policies and procedures to be implemented by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) under each stage (especially stages 2 and 3).  The first stage of the process involved the establishment of a Council of the new PSI in May 2007 with a lay majority for the first time. The second stage, commenced and put into effect in November 2008, established a new regulatory regime, operated by the PSI, for the registration of pharmacists and retail pharmacy businesses.  The third, and final stage of the commencement process will deal with the Complaints, Inquiries and Discipline provisions of the Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">A Standards Advisory Group was established by HIQA to develop National Quality Standards on Residential Services for People with Disabilities.  The Group comprised officials of HIQA, my Department, the HSE, service providers, organisations representing people with disabilities and service users, and met on a number of occasions during 2008.  Following a public consultation process initiated by HIQA, the proposed standards were formulated and have now been published.  These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for people with disabilities in a residential setting and relate only to adult services at present.  The Standards Advisory Group has completed its work. No funding was allocated by my Department to the Standards Advisory Group so the issue of cuts in funding does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">My Department is currently working with the HSE and HIQA to quantify the level of funding that would be required to move to full statutory implementation of the Standards.  However, given the current economic situation, a move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, would present significant challenges at this time.  Notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, my Department, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive implementation of the Standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds.  Discussions are also taking place regarding the introduction of an appropriate level of external validation for relevant settings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1924">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), which will commence in January 2010.  The ECCE is being introduced to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  Services can participate in the scheme on the basis of a number of options.  A full or part-time day-care service will be required to provide a pre-school service for 2 hours 15 minutes per day, five days a week for 50 weeks (241 days) per year, in return for the capitation fee of €48.50 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">A playschool sessional service, such as a Montessori, will be required to provide a pre-school service for 3 hours a day, five days a week for 38 weeks (183 days) a year, in return for a capitation fee of €64.50 per week.  However, where for good reason a sessional service is unable to operate over 5 days, consideration will be given to allowing it to participate in the scheme on the basis of providing the pre-school year for 3 hours 30 minutes a day for 4 days a week.  In such cases, a service will be required to provide the pre-school year over 41 weeks (157 days).</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">Further flexibility is provided for in that, a full or part-time service may choose to provide a sessional service over 38 weeks of a year (or 2 sessional services each day) while a sessional service may choose to provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day over 50 weeks.  Also in cases where children attend a full or part-time day-care service for 3 days a week only, consideration will be given to allowing it to participate in the scheme on the basis of providing the pre-school year to those children for 3 hours 45 minutes a day for 3 days a week.  In such cases, a service will be required to provide the pre-school year over 50 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">As a free pre-school year, participating services must agree to provide the service in return for the capitation grant.  This does not preclude a service from charging for additional services provided these are clearly optional to parents.  Optional services can include additional hours, over and above the free pre-school year requirement, and additional services in the form of various one-off, or on-going, activities or services such as outings, birthday parties, specific teaching resources such as dance or music or food.  By their nature, full or part-time services will offer additional hours to the pre-school provision and sessional playschools can offer an additional 30 minutes per day.  However, services must ensure that all such additional services are offered and charged for on an optional basis and are not compulsory.  A parent's agreement cannot be a condition of initial or continued enrolment.  It is also essential that appropriate programme based activities must be provided to children not participating in an optional activity where this takes place during the required period of pre-school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">It is accepted that not all pre-school services will wish to participate in the ECCE, in the same way that some primary schools continue to be fee-paying rather than join the national school system.  However, the Government is committed to introducing the pre-school year as a free and universal scheme.  I understand that the United Kingdom provision in relation to pre-school, is based on an entitlement to a free pre-school educational place which must be provided without any additional fees or charges, other than minor amounts for snacks and trips, with providers being paid directly by the local authorities to in return for provision of the free pre-school place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1936">Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (SI No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards.  It is a requirement for the registration and entry into service of new motor vehicles in the European Union that they have type-approval in accordance with Directive 70/157/EEC, as amended, which sets down the permissible sound levels and exhaust systems for motor vehicles.  Vehicles in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which require vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device to reduce to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine.  Article 85 of these regulations prohibits the use in a public place of a vehicle which causes excessive noise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1941">I gave an update on the Metro North project in reply to Question Nos. 53, 87 and 94 on 26 May last and that remains the position.  The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is continuing with the planning and design work to facilitate the preparation of an application for a railway order to An Bord Pleanála (ABP) for the Metro West project and the Agency is aiming to submit that application early next year.  In relation to the DART Underground project, CIE anticipates that it will lodge an application for a railway order with ABP towards the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The provision of increased capacity is a key consideration in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.  In that context, the DART Underground and Metro North are particularly important rail investments as they form a core part of the planned integrated public transport network for the Greater Dublin Area envisaged by Transport 21.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">The start and completion dates for projects which are yet to commence construction, including Metro North, Metro West and the DART Underground will be determined as appropriate by the outcome of public consultation, the statutory planning approval process, the public procurement process and the funding available during the current difficult economic climate.  The Exchequer capital amounts currently allocated from my Department's Estimate for 2009 in respect of Metro North, Metro West and the DART Underground are €35 million, €10 million and €15 million respectively.  The allocation for these projects next year will be decided in the context of the Estimates for 2010.</p>

I understand that any re-introduction of the "12 day rule" for drivers of international occasional passenger services, would apply to qualifying Irish cross-border services of seven days duration, i.e. where the service lasts at least 24 consecutive hours in a Member State other than the one in which the service started.

Some of the relevant functions have since been passed to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) or the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), formerly Aer Rianta.  Accordingly, the scope of the Deputy's request is too wide to enable me to give a definitive response as some of the necessary records are no longer in the custody of this Department. Given the wide scope of the request, I am not in a position to definitively state how many planning applications within the red zones were objected to or appealed against by my Department.</p>

It is an offence to submit a false declaration in the application for a permit and in relation to forgery, alteration or other illegal use or lending of a permit.  On-street enforcement against illegal use of permits has been strengthened in that Gardaí and local authority traffic wardens have been given power to inspect permits and to detain any permit that is invalid or is being used in an illegal manner.</p>

This is less than the amounts Ireland was entitled to receive which were, for 2007, €748,000 and, for 2008, €758,000.  I am considering seeking further proposals in respect of the amounts unallocated for 2008.  Because of concerns on the part of many Member States about their capacity to effectively exhaust the funds allocated to them, the European Commission proposes to extend the eligibility period for actions under the 2008 Programme from the end of this year to 30 June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">I wish to ensure that Ireland's allocations are availed of as far as possible.  I am aware that the availability of matching funding is an issue in this regard and I am considering if this might be addressed.  One change I propose to make is that future calls for proposals will be directed at local authorities, other public bodies, NGOs and any other organisations that have the capacity to carry out the actions in question and not just at NGOs and partnership companies as was the case with the previous call for proposals.  However, the rules applicable to the Fund as set out in the Council Decision establishing it and in subsequent Decisions of the European Commission must be observed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2010">I take the Deputy's query to refer to inspections of St. Patrick's Institution by bodies other than the Irish Prison Service.  The Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) visited St. Patrick's Institution in October 2006.  The facility has been visited twice by the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, since his appointment in January 2008 and was the subject of two reports by his predecessor, Mr Justice Dermot Kinlen.  St. Patrick's Institution has also been visited in recent years by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, and was visited in an informal capacity by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  The Institution is subject to monthly visits by members of the St Patrick's Institution Visiting Committee.</p>

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in his case.  In May 2008 the High Court refused the Judicial Review Leave Application with the consequence that the earlier decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal stood.</p>
            <p eId="para_2013">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 26 May 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2070">Certificates of naturalisation are issued on payment of the prescribed fee at the time of certification as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Certification fees for Citizenship were last changed in 1993.  The regulations that came into force on 1st August 2008 were the result of a review of citizenship fees that began some time prior to that date and merely bring the amounts in line with inflation for the period 1993-2008.  While the fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing the different categories of applicant, the current certification fees do not recoup the full cost of processing in any category.  As this is a certification fee, it is the date of issue rather than the date of application that must be taken into account.  Certificates of naturalisation can only be issued on payment of the prescribed fee at the time of certification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">The Deputy will be aware that the increased resources that I have allocated to this area have resulted in a considerable improvement in processing times over the past year even though the number of applications for a certificate of naturalisation has continued to see significant growth.  However, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process by granting such persons residency in the State.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the first person concerned, or if new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on her case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of her Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.

Garda Síochána expenditure: There are currently over 275 personnel (Garda and civilian) attached to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  The Gardaí are dedicated to dealing with immigration law and the law on trafficking of persons.  Within the GNIB there is a Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit which provides assistance and investigative expertise in the investigation of these crimes. The work undertaken by the Garda Síochána in relation to human trafficking is assisted by a network of members of the Garda Síochána who are employed as liaison officers in major cities in a number of EU Member States and in international organisations such as Europol and Interpol.</p>

These trained Gardaí are strategically placed in Districts throughout the State.  Since 2008 all student Gardaí are receiving training in human trafficking with over 700 having received such training to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2579">I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 170 of Thursday, 13 November 2008, and the written Reply to that Question.  The person concerned applied for asylum on 14 July 2003.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 May 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received from the person concerned at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">The person concerned has also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2588">The emphasis of Garda speed enforcement is on the use of mobile speed cameras, and their capacity in this area has been substantially enhanced recently.  In September, 2008 the Garda Commissioner and I launched eight new Garda mobile speed detection vehicles.  These state of the art vehicles represent a substantial upgrading of the resources available to An Garda Síochána to address the problem of speeding on our roads, particularly in collision prone zones.  An Garda Síochána also has over 400 hand held speed detection devices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The Garda authorities support the action in the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 to implement a safety camera network.  Consequently, An Garda Síochána is engaging in a procurement process, in accordance with EU Directives, national public procurement procedures and relevant legislation, for the provision and operation of safety cameras.  As a result, a preferred supplier has been selected.  Discussions are taking place between my Department, the Departments of Transport and Finance and An Garda Síochána with a view to making every effort to proceed with this project as speedily as possible. Until contract discussions are concluded, it is not possible to indicate a specific timescale for the project.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2599">I propose to take Questions Nos. 403 to 405, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">The Deputy will be aware that on 22 April 2009 I announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison.  The new policy document is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service (www.irishprisons.ie).  The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in offenders' lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  It forms an integral of the wider range of interventions by criminal justice and community-based agencies.  Therapeutic interventions with convicted sex offenders comprise notably one-to-one interventions, offence-related group interventions, approved in-reach services and interventions available to prisoners generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">Individual therapeutic work with sex offenders serves a number of functions, including support for offenders in their early commitment to change and integration and extension of progress made in group work.  It also has a key role in addressing the risks and needs of offenders who are unable to undertake group programmes.  Individual counselling is provided in all prisons that accommodate sex offenders by the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service and by the Probation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">A new programme of group interventions commenced in January 2009.  The programme, "Building Better Lives", comprises three modules: exploratory open groups ("Exploring Better Lives"); practice open groups ("Practising Better Lives"), and maintenance groups ("Maintaining Better Lives").  The programme replaces the Sex Offender Programme initiated in 1994 and concluded last year, allowing more responsive and flexible delivery to a greater number of offenders.  The programme is delivered in Arbour Hill Prison and offenders will be transferred there from other prisons in order to avail of it.  The new approach allows for interventions to take greater account of individual risk, needs and capacity. Higher risk offenders, for example, can spend longer on offence-based work, if necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">The number of offenders in each group will average 8.  Three exploratory, two practice and two-to-three maintenance groups are envisaged per annum, allowing interventions with up to 60 offenders when fully operational.  To date, six offenders have completed the first module and another eight offenders are currently doing so.  The practice group will begin shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">The Irish Prison Service recognises the potential for community-based services to provide interventions with this group of offenders and is committed to exploring the potential of community and voluntary groups to engage with sex offenders within the prison environment.  Their participation will be within the framework described above and require commitments such as liaising with and reporting to the Irish Prison Service.  Interventions in 2009 will include motivational enhancement groups provided by the Granada Institute in the Midlands and Wheatfield prisons and interventions with young sex offenders provided by the Northside Inter-Agency Project (NIAP) in St Patrick's Institution.  These interventions will be provided with financial support from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">Sex offenders will continue to benefit from other group programmes not specifically designed for sex offenders but addressing their needs, including stress management, anger management and cognitive skills training, as well as interventions by visiting psychiatrists.</p>
            <p eId="para_2606">The compilation of specific statistics relating to the number of sex offenders released in the last 10 years would take an inordinate amount of staff time and could not be justified given other demands on resources. However I would refer the Deputy to the range of statistical information pertaining to sex offenders contained in the significant Discussion Document on the matter which I published in January this year.   Furthermore, the Probation Service is at present supervising 109 sex offenders of which 81 have served a custodial sentence prior to commencing supervision. Of the 109 persons under supervision, 22 have received a fully suspended sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2607">The Probation Service carries out formal risk assessments on offenders using validated risk assessment instruments. This informs both the level of supervision and the targets for intervention during supervision. Evidence from research indicates that the higher the level of risk, the greater the level of intervention required. Supervision levels therefore vary depending on the level of assessed risk. Supervision incorporates a multi agency and cross sectorial approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_2608">Additionally my Department, through the Probation Service, financially supports a broad range of community programmes to support the supervision process. For example, in partnership with the Granada Institute, the Probation Service runs the Lighthouse Sex Offender Treatment Programme. This is a therapeutic group work programme which aims to reduce the risk of re-offending. There are two group work programmes running currently in Dublin and one in Cork. The three programmes offer places to a total on 24 sex offenders at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2609">The Discussion Document on the management of sex offenders alluded to above sets out a range of enhanced initiatives that will result in more strategic targeting of higher risk offenders by the Gardaí and the Probation Service with the full support of the Irish Prison Service. As part of the management of sex offenders I have asked my Department to examine how we might use electronic monitoring technology to monitor sex offenders during the first six months following release from prison. The Project Board set up to look at this matter — which is led by the Probation Service —  is due to report to me in the coming months. In addition, my Department is also examining whether legislation will be necessary to supplement the existing enabling provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 should a pilot phase of electronic monitoring be introduced in this jurisdiction for a specific group or groups of offenders, such as sex offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2610">The details of prisoners in custody under sentence for offences of a sexual nature on 5 June, 2009, are detailed in the following table.</p>

        [22995/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1007">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2640">In a reply to recent correspondence from the Immigrant Council of Ireland I outlined the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2641">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In less than one per cent of cases, the Minister may in his absolute discretion defer making a decision on an application for a particular period of time, in order to consider that application further. This deferral is almost always to the advantage of an applicant whose application would otherwise have been refused, allowing them time to establish a more favourable track record. This practice enhances the fairness of the process.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2642">There are currently over 16,000 applications for naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of this Department that are still awaiting a decision. This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years. In 2002 there were 3,500 applications whereas in 2008, the number of such applications was 10,885. This upward trend seems set to continue and it is anticipated that applications for naturalisation will increase to over 15,000 in the present year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2643">Recently, substantial increased resources have been made available to this Department in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants.  This has also had a positive impact on processing times. The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for certificates of naturalisation is now at twenty three months. The Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in late 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2644">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks and the time taken waiting for resources to become available to perform those checks.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2645">Upon receipt, an initial examination of each application is carried out to determine that the application form is completed fully and correctly and that all requested supporting documentation has been submitted. Passports and other documentation are then examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended. A significant number of applications are initially found to be invalid for a variety of reasons and these are now being dealt with and returned to the applicant within a week.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2646">Further processing takes place at a later stage and involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State. Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard. Investigations are also undertaken to determine if the applicant can be considered to be of good character. Depending on the complexity of any given case, these processes can take a lengthy time to complete. Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to the Minister for a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that a certificate of naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. Therefore, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved, as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued,  and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and the Minister is satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">Certificates of naturalisation are issued on payment of the prescribed fee at the time of certification. Certification fees for citizenship were last changed in 1993. The regulations that came into force on 1 August 2008 were the result of a review of citizenship fees that began some time prior to that date and merely bring the amounts in line with inflation for the period 1993 to 2008. While the fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing the different categories of applicant, the current certification fees do not recoup the full cost of processing in any category.</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">The increased resources that have been allocated to this area have resulted in a considerable improvement in processing times over the past year, even though the number of applications for a certificate of naturalisation has continued to see significant growth. However, as I have pointed out, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the McDaid family on their terrible loss and to wish Damien Fleming a full recovery.  The PSNI investigation is progressing and has led to a number of arrests, with cases being prepared by the relevant authorities. I would again urge anyone with relevant information to share it immediately with the PSNI.</p>
            <p eId="para_2654">Sectarianism needs to be confronted by the entire community in Northern Ireland. It cannot be permitted to continue to blight the progress already made.

It will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2655">The Government recognises that sectarianism is a threat to lasting peace, but one which must be met if the progress made at political level is to be consolidated and developed. In this context, in February 2008 the Government launched the Anti-Sectarianism Fund with the purpose of assisting local efforts to tackle sectarianism and division in society, and to promote tolerance. The Government remains committed to providing assistance from this Fund, and the Reconciliation Fund also administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to those working to develop new and effective strategies to build trust and understanding, and to allow people to build genuine relationships while celebrating their diversity.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_2657">Although the conflict in Sri Lanka has ended, significant humanitarian needs and challenges remain. Almost 300,000 people are now in camps for the displaced, many in very difficult circumstances. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has stated that, in principle, it now has access to all such camps. However, despite the best efforts of the ICRC and other humanitarian organisations, working together with the Sri Lankan Government, urgent needs remain to be addressed, especially in the sectors of shelter, water and sanitation, and food. It is essential that the ICRC, UN agencies and other international humanitarian organisations continue to have unhindered access to all areas where there are displaced people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2658">In response to the humanitarian crisis, the Government has so far provided over €300,000 in funding to Non-governmental Organisations for emergency relief activities, such as medical and nutrition support, the provision of shelter, and distribution of food and non-food items. In addition, a member of Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps has been deployed to Sri Lanka to assist in the emergency response effort of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).</p>
            <p eId="para_2659">It is clear that enormous suffering was inflicted on the civilian population in the course of the conflict. EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Sri Lanka at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 May. They reiterated the need for all parties to fully respect their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and called for the alleged violations of these laws to be investigated through an independent inquiry.  This call was repeated by the EU Presidency at a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 26 and 27 May at which Ireland also called for an independent inquiry.  I would see any inquiry as one element in the overall response of the international community to the post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of Sri Lanka. It should be coupled with increased humanitarian relief efforts and by a longer-term focus on reconstruction, economic and social development, and the restoration of basic services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">An inclusive reconciliation and peace process must be initiated, based on the principles of parity of esteem, consent, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. I welcome President Rajapakse's stated intention to pursue a negotiated settlement with the Tamil community and very much hope that this can begin at an early date. It will be essential that arrangements and mechanisms are in place to ensure the representation of the Tamil population. As I have stated previously, should the relevant parties seek our advice in relation to the peace process, we would be happy to consider any such request.</p>

            <p eId="para_2662">In 2008, the Government spent €918 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA).

The remaining €150 million was administered by other Government Departments, primarily for Ireland's allocation of the EU Development Cooperation budget, contributions by the Department of Finance to the World Bank Group, and contributions by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">This level of expenditure on ODA last year amounted to 0.58% of GNP, making Ireland the sixth most generous aid donor internationally, and the fifth most generous in the European Union, in per capita terms. The Government continues to work towards achieving the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA in 2012. We are already well ahead of most of our EU partners in making progress on the EU commitment to reach the 0.7% target by 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_2665">The Department of Foreign Affairs taxi policy is based on the principle that taxi use by officers should only take place where it is clearly required for the conduct of official business.  The policy operated by my Department provides that taxis may be used for official business when public transport is not available or feasible and when officers are required, because of work or official travel commitments, to travel early in the morning or late at night. Officers frequently need to use taxis when travelling to and from airports, when travelling abroad on official business, particularly to locations where public transport is either unavailable or unsafe. The Department's Missions abroad also need to use taxis on a regular basis, particularly in locations in developing countries where taxi use is often the only viable means of transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2666">This policy provides a balance between the need to minimise the cost to the exchequer while recognising that the particular nature of the Department's work will, inevitably, require continued use of taxis.  The Department's expenditure on taxi usage is monitored and was recently the subject of an internal review. This has resulted in a reduction in the use of taxis, as reflected in the figures below. I am confident that the Department will continue to make savings over the course of the current year.  The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2719">I am aware of some disturbing reports in early April this year, alleging the detention of numbers of Iraqi men, on the grounds of their sexual orientation, with suggestions that they are to be executed. The situation in Iraq is, of course, complex and I understand that international NGOs have been unable to get confirmation that these men are in custody, what charges they may be held on, or whether they are facing execution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2720">Ireland does not have diplomatic representation on the ground in Baghdad but I have asked my officials to engage in fact-finding with EU member states and other concerned parties and we will continue to follow this matter closely. The EU has repeatedly affirmed the principle of non-discrimination, which requires that human rights apply equally to every human being, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. Ireland joins with the EU in rejecting and condemning any manifestation of homophobia as a blatant violation of human dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">I am deeply concerned by all violations of human rights, including those based on sexual orientation and, in particular, the recourse to the death penalty on such grounds. I very much welcomed the de facto suspension of the death penalty which had been observed in Iraq from August 2007 until very recently. It is regrettable that this moratorium appears to have ended and executions resumed, with the carrying out of death sentences against 12 individuals in Kadhamiyah Prison on 3 May. I strongly support the European Union's call for the resumption of this suspension, pending legal abolition of the death penalty in Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_2722">Along with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to support steps by the Iraqi authorities to protect and promote human rights for all Iraqis. Human rights issues are likely to be one of the principal issues addressed in the EU's future political dialogue with Iraq. Arrangements for such political dialogue will form one of the main provisions of the proposed Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently under discussion between the EU and Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">More generally, the EU continues to be actively engaged in efforts within the United Nations to tackle racism and discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation. The French Presidency delivered a statement at the UN General Assembly debate in December 2008 in which the EU urged States to take all necessary measures to ensure that sexual orientation or gender identity should under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties, in particular executions, arrests or detentions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">Most recently, the Czech Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU on the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia on 17 May, expressing concerns about violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms based on sexual orientation and gender identity, in particular the use of death penalty on these grounds, the practice of torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary arrest or detention, denying the right to peaceful assembly, and deprivation of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to health.</p>

            <p eId="para_2726">I am aware of recent reports from a range of reliable sources, including the US State Department, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, about prison conditions in North Korea. To date, my Department has not received representations from human rights groups regarding these recent reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2727">I am gravely concerned about the evidence which exists that serious human rights violations, including the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, as well as appalling living conditions, are systemic in the North Korean prison system. My concerns extend also to the grounds upon which severe prison sentences are imposed, not only on individuals, but also on their family members, including children.  These issues — and others relating to human rights violations — are raised bilaterally with the North Korean authorities by our Ambassador in Seoul, who is accredited to North Korea, during his regular visits to the North. They have also been raised by senior officials visiting from my Department. Our representations have been met with strong denials and accusations of interference in North Korea's international affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2728">North Korea broke off the human rights dialogue which the EU initiated with it some years ago, after the EU had spearheaded the successful move in the UN's Human Rights Council to have a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights appointed for North Korea. EU meetings with North Korea continue to take place and human rights concerns, including issues relating to prisoners, are always raised by the EU side. The most recent such meeting, at senior official level, took place during an EU Troika visit to Pyongyang from 21-23 March 2009. Other EU countries, including Ireland, continue to raise human rights issues in bilateral contacts with North Korea.</p>
            <p eId="para_2729">North Korea has consistently refused to recognise, or to co-operate in any way with, the Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for North Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn. The country's human rights record will be subject to review under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the Human Rights Council in December 2009. Ireland will be actively involved in this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2731">The Government is aware of reports from the relevant UK authorities of a number of leaks of radioactive material into the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, from the Faslane naval base in recent years. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has advised that ongoing environmental monitoring by them and other agencies shows no evidence of an increase in radioactivity concentrations in the Irish Sea that could be attributable to releases from the base in question. The RPII's environmental monitoring programme has been in place for a number of decades. It is a comprehensive, robust and well developed programme which is designed to detect any anomalies that might arise as a result of radioactive leaks into the Irish Sea. As such it offers a high level of confidence that any anomalies resulting from the Faslane leaks would be detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">In view of the RPII advice, the specific issue of radiation releases at Faslane has not been raised with the British authorities in our ongoing contacts with them. These contacts have been expanded and enhanced significantly in recent years and issues of concern to the Government are raised with the British authorities in this framework of enhanced co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2733">The Government takes seriously the issue of any actual or potential radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea by UK nuclear installations. This is evidenced by our continuing efforts to bring about the decommissioning and closure of the Sellafield plant in Cumbria, as well as our work through the Oslo-Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) to achieve progressive and substantial reductions of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. OSPAR is one of a number of international bodies through which the Government seeks continuing improvements in nuclear safety and radiological protection. In addition, Ireland's strong stance on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is well known internationally and I and my officials underline it at all appropriate fora.</p>

            <p eId="para_2808">While it does not fall within the direct ambit of the Department to allocate Voted Exchequer funds for the specific purpose of addressing social deprivation a number of the Department's various funding schemes and programmes in the sports and arts sectors contribute to this goal indirectly by providing financial assistance for the development of arts and sports infrastructures at the local, regional and national levels.  These schemes and programmes have particular regard to applications for funding in respect of disadvantaged areas throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">For example, the Department's Sports Capital Programme (SCP) targets and prioritises projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged, or as serving disadvantaged areas, including RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  In particular, such projects are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available towards their projects, and they can also receive extra marks during the assessment process.  Through these measures, the SCP has invested more than €146 million in designated disadvantaged areas.  Under the 2008 SCP, 265 projects from disadvantaged areas were allocated funding of €16.8 million.  Full details of these projects are available on the Department's website at www.dast.gov.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_2811">My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the country. The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy also identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas. The strategy will also take into account the results of the National Audit of Sports Facilities, which is ongoing at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">The National Sports Facilities Strategy will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme. One of the stated aims and objectives of the existing programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2002, those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) and CLÁR areas are treated as disadvantaged under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications. They are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available towards their project and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process by the application of socioeconomic disadvantage criterion.  Indeed under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, I was happy to reduce the level of own funding required by applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas to 10% from 20%.  This is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  Successful projects under the Sports Capital Programme RAPID areas may also qualify to receive top-up funding of up to 30% of their Sports Capital allocation, payable by the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in addition to their sports capital allocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2820">There is no doubt that 2009 will be a very difficult year for tourism globally.  Nevertheless it is important to remember that, despite the downturn, millions of people across the world will still take holidays this year. I know that the industry and the tourism agencies are fighting hard for every bit of this business.  To assist the tourism sector through this current difficult period, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports are being rolled out by the Tourism State Agencies under the Tourism Services budget of the Department.  For example, despite cutbacks in public expenditure, the core overseas marketing spend has been maintained in 2009 at over €47 million, in recognition of the key contribution which tourism makes to the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">Tourism Ireland is telling customers in key markets that Ireland is easily accessible and offers great value for money at present, as well as rolling out its new destination campaign "Go Where Ireland Takes You". I am assured that Tourism Ireland is keeping all of its marketing programmes for 2009 under review to ensure they maintain the flexibility and responsiveness that is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland has committed to its largest ever campaign to promote home holidays in 2009, on foot of research indicating that more Irish people will consider swapping their overseas trips for breaks in Ireland.  Fáilte Ireland is also working closely with tourism businesses all over Ireland, supporting enterprises and helping them to achieve real cost savings and efficiencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">While I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  Accordingly, I established the Tourism Renewal Group, which has been tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy to ensure that it is focused for the short term and, looking further ahead, that the tourist industry is well placed to benefit from the upturn when it comes.  I expect the Group to report back to me in the near future with recommendations in the form of a Framework for Action for the period to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">The industry deserves great credit for its commitment to quality in responding to the current challenging economic conditions through more flexible pricing and offering special value offers and packages. I am confident that, with the support of the agencies, the tourism sector here has the capacity to manage the current cyclical slowdown and that, looking further ahead, the Renewal Group's Review will help the sector to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.</p>

The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme specify that the Department will pay grants in stages as an approved project proceeds by reimbursing the applicant's costs when they submit original, paid, valid invoices or certificates of payment.  The Department typically pays 70% of the value of the valid paid invoices submitted.  In addition, the Department reserves 5% of the grant pending confirmation from a consultant or architect that the facility has been satisfactorily completed in all respects and that the defects liability period has expired.  In the case of the grantee in question, the Department has already authorised the payment of €98,000 on 27 May 2009 on foot of the valid, paid invoices received to date.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_2872">The Charities Act 2009, which was signed into law on 28 February 2009, demonstrates the Government's commitment to deliver reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  The Act is intended to boost public confidence in the sector through increased transparency and proportionate regulation.  It will provide a legislative framework for better administration of charitable organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">On commencement, section 47 of the Act provides that every registered charity will be required to keep proper books of accounts.  Furthermore, section 48 provides that registered charities, apart from those explicitly exempted in the Act, will be required to provide an "annual statement of accounts" to a new Charities Regulatory Authority.  The detail as to what should be contained in the annual statement of accounts is to be prescribed in regulations made by the Minister.  Incorporated charities will continue to be subject to the relevant accounts and audit requirements under company law.  To avoid imposing a dual filing obligation on such entities, the Companies Registration Office will forward such accounts to the new authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2874">Under section 50, any charity that is required to provide an annual statement of accounts to the new authority will, if its annual income or expenditure is below a threshold to be prescribed by the Minister, up to a maximum of €500,000, be required to have its accounts examined by an independent person.  If the annual income or expenditure of a charity is above the prescribed threshold, it will be required to provide audited accounts to the new authority.  There is also a reserve power in section 53(4) for the authority to require a charity whose income or expenditure is below the threshold to have its accounts audited.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">In addition, section 52 of the Act provides that all registered charities will be required to provide an "annual report" on their charitable activities to the new authority and attach the annual statement of accounts thereto, where applicable.  Section 54 provides that both the annual report and any documents attached thereto will be made available for public inspection.  Section 39 further provides that the authority shall also cause to be established and maintained a "register of charities" that shall be available to the public, including on the Internet.  The register will contain a broad range of information, both financial and otherwise, on any charity that raises funds from the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">The present position is that the Charities Act 2009, which is a substantial piece of legislation, has not yet been commenced.  There is a considerable body of work to be undertaken in preparation for statutory regulation and my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in that regard.  This plan will ensure that the essential elements are in place to enable the introduction at the appropriate time of the statutory regulatory framework provided for in the Act.  In other countries, it has taken a number of years after enactment of the legislation for the new regulatory system for charities to be fully introduced.  This is likely to be the case in Ireland too.  I should inform the Deputy that I have initiated an examination of the feasibility of commencing some individual provisions in the Act at an early date, subject to legal advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">I understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that the school referred to by the Deputy was established by a company limited by guarantee over ten years ago.  The údarás provided support in the form of a building leased to the company and grants in excess of €150,000.  However, this special purpose school closed after five years.  The building in which the school was located has since been leased to another business and is no longer available.  The údarás has informed me that, as in the case of all projects, the matter of re-establishing such a school would have to be assessed in terms of funding and viability, value for money and benefit to the area.  It would also have to be in line with the organisation's statutory functions regarding developing and maintaining industries and productive schemes in the Gaeltacht.  The údarás has not received any application in respect of the re-establishment of the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_2979">All projects funded under the Community Development Programme are either companies limited by guarantee in their own right or, in the case of a small number of projects, are hosted by a company limited by guarantee.  The number of Community Development Projects/groups funded under the Community Development Programme per county for 2009 is set out in the table that follows this reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">Following the recent supplementary budget, the allocation for the Community Development Programme for 2009 is €20.9 million. As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is undertaking a review of the Community Development Programme.  There is an ongoing need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that we are constantly subjecting our activities to critical appraisal.  In that way, we can continue to ensure that those we work to assist will receive the maximum benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_3038">As the Deputy will be aware, under the Decentralisation Programme it has been agreed that the headquarters of my Department will relocate to Charlestown, County Mayo.  The programme is well advanced in my Department.  From a total of 140 staff due to decentralise, 100 have now relocated to an interim location in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, where two properties are being leased by the OPW to accommodate the staff concerned.  I understand from the OPW that the cost of leasing both properties in Tubbercurry is just under €175,000 per year, while fit-out costs to date for both buildings have amounted to some €402,000.  In relation to the acquisition of a permanent site for my Department's headquarters at Charlestown, I am advised that the OPW is liaising with the Department of Finance on the purchase of such a site, including the commitment of funding in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_3041">I propose to take Questions Nos. 443 and 444 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3042">I can confirm to the Deputy that IRD Kiltimagh Limited, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cairn International Trade Centre Limited, wrote to my Department in July 2008 offering accommodation and workspace at the Cairn International Trade Centre, Kiltimagh, County Mayo, which was being developed at the time.  My Department was again approached in April 2009 in relation to this matter.  I am arranging to have copies of both letters forwarded directly to the Deputy for his information.  I should add that IRD Kiltimagh Limited approached the Minister for Finance on the matter in April.  These approaches were made in the context of the proposed relocation of my Department's headquarters to County Mayo under the Decentralisation Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3043">In relation to the provision of funding from my Department to the property developer in this case, I understand that IRD Kiltimagh Limited acted as the agent of the Western Rural Development Company, which was the entity previously contracted by my Department to administer the LEADER programmes and Rural Social Scheme in East Mayo and to which my Department provided funding in the normal way for those purposes.  Following the cohesion process, these contracts are now held by Mayo North East LEADER Partnership Teo.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">In relation to the issue of funding from within the ambit of my Department for the development at Cairn International Trade Centre, I understand that IRD Kiltimagh Limited approved two grants under the LEADER+ programme 2000-2006 of €12,000 and €9,675 respectively towards a feasibility study and marketing project in respect of the property concerned.  I am advised that the Western Development Commission approved a loan of €1 million to IRD Kiltimagh Limited towards the construction of Cairn International Trade Centre.  This loan is repayable in 2013.  I am further advised that, as security on this loan, the commission has a first charge on certain assets of IRD Kiltimagh Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">In relation to the construction of the building, I understand that the commission's conditions that were attached to the loan required, <i>inter alia</i>, that a fixed price contract be put in place for the construction of the building to guard against cost overruns and to protect their investment.  I can confirm that my Department has had no direct dealings with the construction of this building nor has it entered into any leasing agreement with the owners or occupiers of the building.  As I previously informed the House, it was decided that the OPW should examine the property in question on foot of the approach made to the Department of Finance regarding the turn-key potential of the building.  I emphasise again that this is a prudent response on the part of the OPW and implies no decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_3047">A grant of €55,200 in respect of current expenditure was sanctioned by my Department, under Ciste na Gaeilge, for 2009 to the organisation concerned in the Deputy's Question.  Organisations in receipt of such funding are required to fulfil a number of conditions, including providing an annual business plan and annual audited accounts.  As the funding is in respect of current expenditure, the issue of a lien on property does not arise.  The day-to-day running of an organisation funded under Ciste na Gaeilge is strictly a matter for the organisation.  Consequently, my Department is not involved in the day-to-day operations or management of such organisations.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for my Department to seek the appointment of an independent representative on the board of the organisation concerned.</p>

These centres provide a valuable service in promoting and co-ordinating voluntary activities throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">The "Give it a Swirl" day is an initiative promoted by Volunteer Centres Ireland through the network of volunteer centres, as part of the National Day of Volunteering.  It is an excellent example of an innovative approach to encouraging people of all ages and from all walks of life — individuals, families, community groups and businesses — to become involved in a hands-on volunteer project in their local community. The events countrywide include activities such as community clean-ups, tree planting, decorating homes for the elderly and painting murals.  Further details on events planned for the Deputy's constituency would be available from his local volunteer centre.  Finally, I should mention that the Steering Group on Active Citizenship established by the Taoiseach is considering options for national initiatives and events in support of volunteering.</p>

Each individual group allocates project funding on the basis of detailed local development strategies and following extensive evaluation and approval processes.  In line with the bottom-up nature of the LEADER approach, the Group is the principle decision-maker in the allocation of project funding.  My Department does not have any role to play in this regard.  In the case in question, I understand that the Group has decided that self-catering accommodation projects are not a priority for them in 2009.  The situation will be reviewed by them in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3124">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section — http://www.pobal.ie/Funding%20Programmes/ Rapid/Pages/Funding.aspx — and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_3125">I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3126">The funding provided under the RAPID programme to Cork City Council and Cork County Council for each year in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and to date in 2009 is outlined in the following tables.</p>

She did not appeal against this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_3236">I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 463 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3237">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_3238">The Government decided in 1997 to approve the redevelopment of Ballymun and a regeneration programme commenced in 1998. The provision of rent supplement in the Ballymun designated area was identified by housing authorities as a risk to the tenure diversity objective of the project which is to achieve a more balanced tenure mix by providing additional private market housing. It is envisaged that by the end of the regeneration project the tenure balance will be around 44% public and 56% private compared to the 80% public at the start of the project.  In response to the concerns about achieving a tenure balance mix, Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provided that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3239">The Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government advised in 2008 that, on the advice of Dublin City Council, he had decided that the Ballymun area merited designation as an area of regeneration for the purposes of Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. Accordingly, with effect from 27 November 2008, rent supplement is not paid in respect of accommodation situated in the Ballymun regeneration area, as outlined by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3240">The measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration. Specific provision is made to ensure that:</p>
            <p eId="para_3241">people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3242">people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3243">It is not intended that the Section 25 provisions will be open-ended and they will be reviewed jointly by the Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when the Ballymun regeneration is completed in 2012 or earlier, if appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3244">The area designated as being in the Ballymun regeneration project includes the neighbourhoods of Coultry and Shangan, Dublin 9 and the neighbourhoods of Poppintree, Balcurris and Silloge/Sandyhill, Dublin 11. It reflects the area within Dublin City Council where Ballymun Regeneration Ltd. is actively engaged in the regeneration programme. Claims for rent supplement from people residing in the Finglas area are processed in the normal way by the community welfare service in Finglas.</p>

            <p eId="para_3246">The average time to award a claim for carer's allowance is currently just under 9 weeks.  Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">The number of claims for carers allowance submitted in 2008 was 18,900.  A total of 7,460 new applications for Carer's Allowance has been received this year to date (week end 29 May 2009), and a total of some 8000 claims has been finalised.   The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.  A review of the existing processes and procedures has been completed by the Department for Carer's Allowance with the objective of reducing claim processing times, and improvements have been implemented.  The position continues to be kept under close review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3251">There are currently over 88,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 48% since the end of December 2007.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided for an increase in the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent from €18 to €24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009.  It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there is now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">Data published by the CSO show that rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009.  A leading property website recently reported that rents have fallen by almost 16% in the twelve months to March 2009 with 5% of the fall occurring since the start of 2009.  It is essential that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.  Other changes in the Supplementary Budget provided for new maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">Existing recipients of rent supplement were advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment from 1 June 2009 and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords were advised through advertising in national and provincial newspapers of the general reduction in rent supplement payments.  A number of organisations representing landlords and tenants were also contacted and advised of the changes to the rent supplement scheme.  In the current climate, where there is a large number of vacant rental properties, it is expected that people will be able to get accommodation at the appropriate rental level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case e.g. where homelessness might result due to the inability of a person to meet their rent payment. The Department is also in discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the role of local authorities who are responsible for providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need.</p>

The Department's records show that he has insufficient qualifying contributions paid and/or credited in the governing contribution year (2007).  Following an investigation into the insurability of his employment between 1 March 2007 and 11 October 2007 it was decided that his employment in this period was insurable at PRSI Class A.  The decision was issued on 29 May 2009 and because the decision can be appealed by the person concerned or by the employer within 21 days the jobseeker's benefit claim cannot be decided until the period for appeal expires on the 19 June 2009.  It is open to the person concerned to apply for jobseeker's allowance or supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime.</p>

The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs.

            <p eId="para_3348">Jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance are among a number of payments administered by the Department to meet the income needs of people of working age.  The cost of a jobseeker claim is related to the circumstances of the person making the claim.  A jobseeker payment is comprised of a number of variables including the rate of payment which the individual may be entitled to, the rate of payment for adult or child dependents and the duration of the claim.  In addition the person may qualify for supplementary payments such as fuel allowance, rent supplement/mortgage interest supplement or Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p>

The programme expenditure outturn for jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit 2008 was just under €2.1 billion and provision has been made in the 2009 estimate for expenditure of over €4.612 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_3353">There are currently over 88,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 48% since the end of December 2007.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent be increased from €18 to €24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009.  It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  New maximum rent limits have also been introduced from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3354">Data published by the CSO show that rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009.  A leading property website recently reported that rents have fallen by almost 16% in the twelve months to March 2009 with 5% of the fall occurring since the start of 2009.  It is essential therefore that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">Existing recipients of rent supplement were notified in advance of the change being made to their rent payment from 1 June 2009 and advised that this communication could be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords have also been advised through advertising in the national and provincial newspapers of the general reduction in rent supplement payments and a number of organisations representing landlords and tenants were contacted and advised of the changes to the rent supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, once the tenancy is at least a year old and where the rent has not been reviewed in the previous twelve months, the tenant is entitled to ask a landlord to review the rent in payment where the tenant feels that the rent exceeds the market rate for the property.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.  In this climate, it is expected that people will be able to get accommodation at the appropriate rental level if a landlord is unwilling to reduce the rent in any particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">The obligations of landlords and tenants in relation to tenancy terminations, including the refund of deposits, is also provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Under these provisions, tenants are entitled to a refund of a deposit paid at the commencement of the tenancy where there is no rent or utility bills owing, no damage to the dwelling beyond normal wear and tear and the proper notice prescribed in the Act is served.  Disputes between landlords and tenants about any aspect of rent or the return of a deposit may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3358">While a person may have a tenancy agreement with a landlord, such agreements or leases cannot take away from the rights and obligations provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Where a tenant is bound by the terms of a fixed term contract, they generally may not terminate a tenancy before the expiry of the term of the contract. The Act does, however, allow the tenant to seek to assign or sublet the tenancy, with the consent of the landlord.  In circumstances where the tenancy has not been validly terminated, the landlord has the discretion to retain the deposit to cover any outstanding rent due under the lease, if they suffer financial loss from the early termination. However, landlords would be expected to take steps to mitigate any such losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case.  Officers have been advised that support, appropriate to the circumstances of the particular case, may be provided to rent supplement tenants for up to two months, while alternative accommodation is being sourced within the existing rent limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_3367">Rent Supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution of €24, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €24 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3368">Social welfare legislation provides that all income, subject to certain disregards, is assessable for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Under section 196(1)(b) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 "the weekly means of any person for the purpose of ascertaining his or her entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance shall be calculated in accordance with the Rules contained in Part 4 of Schedule 3" of the Act.  Rule 1(2) provides that all income in cash is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">However, in assessing the means of a person for rent supplement purposes, the first €75 a week of earnings or maintenance payments, together with 25% of any additional such income above €75 can be disregarded. This is to ensure that the family benefits from the extra earnings/maintenance income up to that level before it affects entitlement to rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">As explained previously, vouched housing costs of up to €95.23 per week (rent or mortgage) are disregarded in assessing maintenance payments as means when determining entitlement to one-parent family payment.  However, this amount is assessable in deciding the appropriate level of rent supplement payable to a lone parent with income from maintenance payments, as the rent supplementation payment is based on the net amount that a person has available to meet their accommodation costs from their own resources. In these circumstances, the earnings/maintenance disregard for a one parent family claimant claiming rent supplement support is applicable only to such income in excess of the sum of €95.23 a week.</p>
            <p eId="para_3371">Overall, the means assessment rules are designed to give an incentive to lone parents to seek maintenance payments to improve their household income position, while ensuring that families in that situation have access to the appropriate levels of rent supplementation to meet their accommodation needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3380">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_3381">The recent Supplementary Budget provided for the weekly minimum contribution that a person is expected to pay towards their rent to be increased from €18 to €24 from 1 June 2009.  The Supplementary Budget also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382">The Executive has advised that prior to 1 June 2009, the person concerned was in receipt of rent supplement of €190.20 per week, based on household income of jobseekers and disability allowance.  A deduction of €10.00 a week was being made to discharge an overpayment of supplementary welfare allowance which arose in 2008, leaving him with a net weekly rent supplement payment of €180.20. When the reductions to rent supplement payments, provided for in the Supplementary Budget, were applied from 1 June 2009, his entitlement to rent supplement of €190.20 was reduced by €21 to €169.20 per week or a net €159.20 when the €10 a week deduction is made in respect of the overpayment of supplementary welfare allowance in 2008. If the circumstances of the person concerned have changed, he should contact the community welfare officer at the local Health Centre and request a review of his entitlement to rent supplement.</p>

Legislation provides that summary decisions may be made where the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that a case is of such a nature that it can be properly determined on the basis of documentary evidence and without an oral hearing.  The Appeals Officer does not intend to reopen this case by way of an oral hearing.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

He was in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance at that time. Under Article 9 (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 412 of 2007) it is a condition of a person’s entitlement to rent supplement that they “could reasonably have afforded the rent at the commencement of the tenancy”. </p>

            <p eId="para_3430">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution of €24 a week because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3432">As part of Budget 2009, the minimum weekly contribution which a person is required to contribute towards their rent was increased from €13 to €18 with effect from January 2009.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent was increased from €18 to €24 from 1 June 2009.  It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  These measures account for the reduction in the rent supplement payments to the person concerned this year.  The Executive has advised that she should contact her local community welfare officer if there has been a change in her circumstances so that her entitlement to rent supplement can be reviewed.</p>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, an Garda Síochána), which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts etc.</p>

Such assistance has been rendered by the Defence Forces since 5 February 2003, and liaison between the Gardaí and the Defence Forces in this regard is continuing.  It would not be appropriate for me, for reasons of security, to indicate the number of Defence Forces personnel involved in such operations.  However, the estimated costs to the Defence Forces for personnel on security duty at Shannon Airport for the years in question are outlined below.  These costs are met from within the Defence Vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_3440">The following items are taken into consideration when calculating the costs involved in providing aid to the civil power at Shannon Airport i.e. Security Duty Allowance, rations and fuel.  The following table sets out the amount of costs incurred for the period in question.  The amount of costs incurred in 2006 take into account extra requirements for the visit of President George Bush in March and anti-war protests in October 2006.</p>

This concerns the use of lands by the Defence Forces that would be the responsibility of the proposed Authority but over which the Minister is the final arbiter in the event of any dispute.  Amongst other issues, the Department is also looking at the varying usage of the lands by a range of different interests, not least the Defence Forces and how these can be accommodated and managed within the overall framework of the Authority's mandate and in a manner which provides an effective value for money solution for the State.</p>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of slurry as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters. In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast. There are no proposals to amend the Regulations in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3580">The Government's policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste — Delivering Change, identified the lack of sustainable and economically attractive markets and outlets for recyclable materials as one of the main barriers to an improved and sustainable national recycling performance.  The significant cost and effort associated with the segregation, collection, sorting, pre-treatment and reprocessing of recyclable materials demands that markets be developed to realise the full resource value of all recyclable materials that are reclaimed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3581">To address these issues, I have appointed a full time executive team and am providing funding of €13 million to implement the recommendations set out in the Market Development Programme for Waste Resources.  The programme aims to promote sustainable demand for recovered materials and support the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials. It will also identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products.  In this context, I recently launched the programme's inaugural Action Plan for 2009 which sets out the team's priorities for the year ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_3582">I am also fully committed to the continuing development of the national network of waste recycling facilities.  Since 2002 over €100 million has been allocated by my Department to local authorities to assist in the capital costs of establishing and developing such facilities.  Funding at the rate of up to 85% of approved costs will continue to be made available from the Environment Fund to support local authorities in the further development of waste recycling infrastructure.  In addition, my Department also provides a subvention to local authorities to assist with the operational costs associated with running their recycling facilities.  Payments amounting to €6.4 million have recently been made to the local authorities to cover operational costs incurred during the six month period from July to December 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3768">Under section 160 of the Local Government Act, 2001 the Minister may, having consulted with the Public Appointments Service, declare qualifications of such classes and descriptions as he/she thinks fit for a specified employment under a local authority or for employments belonging to a specified class, description or grade.  The qualifications set out general criteria in relation to such matters as broad experience and education for the office of county manager, office of city manager and town clerk, office of assistant county manager and office of assistant city manager.  These qualifications are complemented by the competency-based approach used in the selection process undertaken on behalf of local authorities by the Public Appointments Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3769">The Public Appointments Service, in co-operation with my Department and the relevant local authorities, conducts the interview process which precedes the appointment by a county or city council of a county or city manager. Each candidate's knowledge in areas of relevance to the performance and functions of local government is assessed through a comprehensive competency based interview process.  Preliminary interviews are based on career achievements, personal contribution, and managerial efficiency, with final interview competencies based on strategic management, resource management, and people management / leadership skills. These competencies are kept under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3771">The financial information requested in the question is provided in the table which follows.  The Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund promotes sustainable development by assisting small scale, non-profit environmental projects at local level.  The Fund has been in operation since 1997 when 65 projects received funding directly from the Department.  Following a review, administration of the scheme was devolved to city and county councils in 2001. In 2008 the number of projects funded reached 387.</p>
            <p eId="para_3772">It is a condition of the scheme that Departmental funds allocated to a project must be matched by a similar amount from the local authority.  It is also desirable that the combined local authority/Departmental funding be supplemented by other funding sources to maximise the potential of partnership arrangements.  I have recently announced details of the 2009 Local Agenda Partnership Fund and applications are currently being received by Local Authorities from interested parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_3806">Currently a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal applies in sixteen towns and cities around the country (Dublin since 1990, Cork since 1995, Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford since 1998, Celbridge, Galway, Leixlip, Naas and Waterford since 2000, Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee since 2003). The selection of these areas took account of air quality monitoring data and population size.</p>
            <p eId="para_3807">In addition to the above, in October last year the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG Ltd) and the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr Michael Kitt, T.D., signed a new voluntary agreement to maintain low levels in the sulphur emissions of bituminous coal and petcoke, and to maintain existing limitations, through smokeless zones, on the marketing, sale and distribution of solid fuels.  The agreement also provides that in the towns and environs of Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis, SFTG Ltd. will maintain the smokeless fuel market penetration level of 75%, as a percentage of overall solid fuel sales, as set out in previous agreements.  These four towns are additional to those already covered by smokeless zones.  A copy of the agreement is available to download from my Department's website www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3808">The question of extending the areas subject to a ban on the marketing and sale of smokeless fuels is kept under review in consultation with local authorities and having regard to the need to ensure good air quality.   Monitoring at permanent and mobile monitoring stations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local authorities confirms that air quality in Ireland is good and the data currently available do not support any such extension at present.  However, at my Department's request, in line with the Programme for Government commitment on monitoring air quality, the EPA recently completed a review of the mechanism by which ambient air quality is monitored.  The adequacy of the air quality monitoring network, in light of population change in urban areas, is relevant in that context. It is anticipated that the final report from the EPA to the Department will be available in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3812">In summer 2008 my Department engaged consultants, White Young Green (WYG), to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline, following works on the area of the site known as the East Tip.  Their work was the subject of formal peer review.  The total amount spent was €394,948.61.  This comprised all costs associated with environmental testing, analysis, monitoring and reporting in respect of assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity; assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by the site conditions and ambient air monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_3813">The report on the assessment of site conditions was made publicly available on my Department's website in December 2008.  The WYG assessment found that there was no immediate health or environmental threat posed by the site and did not suggest a risk to the health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base.  Recommendations arising out of the WYG and peer review reports have informed proposals which are currently being considered by Government.  Dust deposition and PM10 monitoring, which is carried out at two locations in the vicinity of the site and at a location in Cobh, is still ongoing.  The ongoing cost of this monitoring is c.€12,000 per annum.</p>

            <p eId="para_3897">The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) is the statutory agency with regulatory, advisory and monitoring responsibility with regard to ionising radiation in Ireland. The EPA has no function in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3898">I am aware of reports from the relevant UK authorities of a number of leaks of radioactive material into the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, from the Faslane naval base in recent years. I understand that the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) does not have formal regulatory powers in respect of the holding of radioactive material in, or radioactive releases from UK Ministry of Defence premises, which includes the Faslane base. This issue has not therefore been the subject of meetings or correspondence between the RPII and SEPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3899">The Government takes seriously the issue of any actual or potential radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea by UK nuclear installations. This is evidenced by our continuing efforts to bring about the decommissioning and closure of the Sellafield plant in Cumbria, as well as our work through the Oslo-Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) to achieve progressive and substantial reductions of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. OSPAR is one of a number of international bodies through which the Government seeks continuing improvements in nuclear safety and radiological protection. In addition, Ireland's strong stance on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is well known internationally and continues to be articulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3900">With regard to the question of any danger posed to Ireland by these leaks, I am advised by the RPII that ongoing monitoring by them and other agencies shows no evidence of an increase in radioactivity concentrations in the Irish Sea that could be attributable to releases from the Faslane naval base in Scotland. The RPII's environmental monitoring programme has been in place for a number of decades. It is a comprehensive, robust and well developed programme which is designed to detect any anomalies that might arise as a result of radioactive leaks into the Irish Sea. As such it offers a high level of confidence that any anomalies resulting from the Faslane leaks would be detected. The RPII also works in close co-operation with its Northern counterpart, the Environment Agency of Northern Ireland, on issues of common interest and concern, such as monitoring of the Irish Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_3901">On a broader level, communication on radiological matters between Ireland and the UK at both official and regulator level has been expanded and enhanced in recent years. I am confident that any issues of concern to the Government can be raised with the UK authorities in this context of enhanced co-operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3903">There are three different types of wall insulation solution grant-aided under the Home Energy Savings scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  These are cavity wall insulation, internal dry-lining insulation and external wall insulation.  The appropriate insulation solution will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the structure of the wall and the internal size and features of the rooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">SEI advises that the "u-value" of a wall is the commonly used measure of the insulation properties of a wall.  The lower the u-value, the less heat is lost through the wall.  Injection of insulating product from the outside is an ideal method for insulating cavity walls and can reduce the u-value of such a wall by almost 70%.  This is an excellent low-cost insulation solution.  A grant of €400 is available under the scheme for this approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">However, this insulation solution is not suitable for a cavity block wall, which is a fundamentally different structure from a cavity wall.  Typically, cavity walls consist of two rows of brick or concrete block, with a complete cavity or space between them.  Cavity block walls contain hollows inside each block.  Most heat loss in such walls occurs through the cavity block ends and spine.  Filling the hollows with insulation material will not address this and therefore such an insulation solution would reduce the u-value by only about 22%.  This estimate assumes that the hollows can be completely filled.  This is not certain, as it can be affected by mortar blockages.  There is also a high risk of damp occurring on the internal walls with this solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">For cavity block walls, SEI recommends either internal dry-lining insulation or external wall insulation.  These solutions will reduce the u-value of the wall by approximately 80%.  Grants of €2,500 and €4,000 respectively are available for these solutions, reflecting their higher installation cost.  The internal dry-lining option is to be preferred, because of its considerably lower cost, compared to external insulation and for this reason the grant available for this represents a higher percentage of the installation cost, to encourage homeowners to favour this option.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3908">The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 provided for a new framework for the safety regulation of electrical contractors by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  I am advised by the CER that, following detailed consultations, the new system for the regulation of electrical contractors with respect to safety came into operation on January 5th 2009.  Both the Electrical Contractors Safety &amp; Standards Association (ECSSA) and the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland (RECI) are the regulatory bodies appointed by the CER to carry out this function on its behalf.  These bodies are referred to as the Electrical Safety Supervisory Bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">This new system replaced a voluntary system for safety with regard to electrical contracting works that had been in operation for some time.  Under the voluntary system any party or individual could carry out electrical work with no legal requirement or enforcement in place with regard to the qualifications of those carrying out electrical work or with regard to the certification, testing or inspection of electrical work.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 provided for the introduction of a mandatory regime in the interest of public safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">Under the new regulatory scheme, I am advised that the majority of electrical installation work undertaken will require certification.  The only party that can legally certify work is a Registered Electrical Contractor.  To become a Registered Electrical Contractor, an individual must register with one of the electrical safety supervisory bodies and must meet specified standards in terms of qualification and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_3911">Electrical works which require certification must be carried out and tested in line with the relevant technical rules, and in particular the National Wiring Rules, which are developed by the Electro Technical Council of Ireland.  The certification of electrical work by a Registered Electrical Contractor provides the customer with assurance that the electrical installation has been tested and verified in line with those rules and is therefore safe.  By certifying the electrical installation the Registered Electrical Contractor is declaring that he or she is taking responsibility for the full installation and its safety.  The onus therefore is placed on the certifying Registered Electrical Contractor to ensure that all of the electrical installation is compliant with the requirements of the National Wiring Rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_3912">All Registered Electrical Contractors are also obliged to adhere to the requirements of Rules of Registration of the relevant regulatory body to which they are a member.  Under these rules Registered Electrical Contractors are prohibited from certifying work that they are not responsible for, unless they seek express permission from the relevant regulatory body.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">In order to qualify to certify work, a Registered Electrical Contractor must have served a recognised apprenticeship as an electrician and been awarded a National Craft Certificate; or another suitable electrical award, equivalent to level 6 or higher on the National Framework of Qualifications; and have successfully completed a recognised course in Testing and Verification and Certification in the previous 3 years.  All Registered Electrical Contractors will be subject to ongoing inspection and audit as regards their work.  These arrangements are designed to protect lives and property from the risk of electrical safety incidents.</p>

            <p eId="para_3919">Scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicated that the European eel stock is now outside safe biological limits.   It advised that a recovery plan be developed for the whole stock of European eel and that exploitation and other human activities affecting the stock be reduced to as close to zero as possible.  As required under EU Council Regulation, Ireland submitted a Government approved draft Eel Management Plan to the Commission for approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_3920">Last month two bye-laws were introduced to give effect to the National Eel Management Plan put in place to protect our dwindling eel stocks.  These closed the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012.  The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  Under the Regulation, all aspects of the Plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  At that stage, the bye-laws which were introduced to close the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012 will be reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3921">The ESB, as part of their implementation of the eel plan, have recently advertised for tenders to undertake trap and transport operations.  Ambitious targets have been set within the plan including the trapping and transport of at least 40 tonnes of eel around the turbines at Ardnacrusha and Ballyshannon.  Experienced eel fishermen would be in a very strong position to tender competitively for the provision of the trap and transport operations.  There will also be a limited amount of fishing associated with the research and monitoring to be carried out under the plan.   This will be in the region of 150 man days spread over six river basin districts.</p>

            <p eId="para_3929">Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are high-speed, open access, carrier neutral electronic communications networks, which facilitate competition in the electronic communications market in regional towns and cities nationwide.  Phase I of this Programme was aimed at facilitating the delivery of broadband services in cities and towns that did not have broadband at that time.  The Government approved the building of the Phase I MANs in March 2002.  Phase I has so far delivered optical fibre based networks to twenty-seven towns and cities throughout the country. All twenty-seven are operational and open for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3930">A further ninety-four towns were identified as locations for MANs under Phase II of the Programme on the basis that there was no DSL broadband available from the incumbent service provider in each of the locations.  The Government approved the building of the Phase II MANs in November 2003.  Fifty-nine of these MANs covering sixty-five towns have been completed to date.  Ennis was not included under Phase II of the MANs Programme as DSL Broadband was available in the town at the time of the Government decision. Ennis was however identified as a candidate town for any further phases of the MANs Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3931">Any future broadband investment decisions, including investment in any further phases of the MANs Programme, will be guided by (i) the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband, which is being finalised at present, (ii) the Value for Money and Policy Review undertaken on Phase I of the MANs Programme and published in July 2008 (iii) any other analysis as appropriate and (iv) the availability of resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_4051">A report prepared by Sustainable Energy Ireland for the International Energy Agency (IEA) on wind turbine costs in Ireland in 2008 estimated typical costs for developing a wind farm in Ireland in 2008 in the range of m€1.7/MW to m€2/MW according to the specific characteristics of the project and other relevant factors, including grid connection charges, land prices and exchange rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">The IEA has concluded there is insufficient clarity in the methodology for assessing the comparative costs of wind projects in different countries.  The IEA has therefore proposed a new research task, IEA Wind Task 26, which, among other purposes, will provide a common methodology for comparing the cost of developing wind energy among participating countries as well as development of a methodology that could be used by external observers to estimate wind generation costs.  This will facilitate more accurate comparisons of costs in different countries based on harmonised cost calculation methods.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">Costs vary from country to country for a number of reasons.  Primary factors include the typical scale of wind farm developments within a country, the structure of the wind energy development sector in a country i.e. whether dominated by small-scale project developers or large developers with multiple projects with balance sheet finance, geographic factors such as typical topography and terrain, soil types and average distances from infrastructure such as ports, roads and electricity networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">In Ireland the electricity market is fully liberalised and wind farms projects are typically developed by both large and small-scale independent developers.  Actual costs at any site depend on the purchasing power of the individual project developer, which can affect turbine prices, price variability for wind turbines from year to year, the cost of land, the local topography and terrain and distance from the site to ports, roads and the electricity network.</p>

            <p eId="para_4056">The purpose of the All-island Grid Study was to quantify the ability of the electricity system on the island of Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable energy resources to electricity consumption while maintaining a secure and affordable supply to customer.  The study assesses non-renewable energy technologies including pumped storage, coal-fired Moneypoint and combined cycle gas turbines in the context of their ability to work effectively with a system that includes various amounts of intermittent technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4057">The Study was commissioned from Risø National Laboratory. In table 36 of the "Work-stream 2(b) Wind Variability Management Studies", the authors reference the data sources used which in the case of Turlough Hill is taken from the  All-island modelling project website with additional data supplied by Eirgrid.  In addition in considering pumped storage constraints (A.1.4.14) the authors apply energy efficiency factors for Turlough Hill between 71% when pumping and 50% in the minimum generating state.  A recorded averaged actual round trip energy efficiency of the order of 64% is therefore within the range considered by the authors of the study having regard to its concentration on prioritising renewable energy technologies. There is no conflict between the Eirgrid actual figures for 2008 and the range applied in the All-Island Grid Study which was published in January 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_4073">The enabling of exchanges for broadband purposes is a matter for the owners of the relevant exchanges.  It is anticipated that the facilitation of greater competition via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms should encourage the more rapid enabling of exchanges for broadband.  In order to provide broadband services to areas that are not currently served by broadband my Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  The general area of Creeslough, County Donegal, will be provided with broadband services under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4074">3 is currently planning the construction and roll out of the infrastructure required for the provision of the service.  Challenging roll out targets have been agreed with 3.  Services were launched in a small number of rural areas at the end of April 2009 and the entire NBS area must be covered by September 2010.  However, 3 is not in a position at this juncture, to predict the progression of site roll out in advance of obtaining the necessary permissions.  One month prior to the NBS being launched in any given area, 3 will implement a marketing campaign to announce the forthcoming service availability.  Details of the areas to be covered by 3 under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4110">The EU Nitrates Directive, implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009 (SI no. 101 of 2009), requires that the total amount of livestock manure applied to land in any calendar year must not contain more than 170 kgs of nitrogen per hectare.</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">Non-compliance with the Regulations, such as exceeding the 170 kgs nitrogen limit, may result in sanctions being applied to a farmer's payments under the Single Payment or other EU funded schemes. The vast majority of Irish farmers operate well below this limit however. It is the responsibility of each farmer to ensure that he or she meets the obligations imposed by the Regulations, including compliance with the 170 kgs limit. My Department provides retrospective information to farmers on the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus produced by grazing livestock on holdings to assist farmers in planning their nitrogen per hectare for the coming year.  In addition approximately 60,000 farmers are participating in REPS and working to an approved nutrient management plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4112">Farmers who applied to my Department for a derogation in respect of 2009 may exceed the 170 kgs limit up to a maximum of 250 kgs of nitrogen per hectare, subject to certain conditions. The closing date for derogation applications has now expired. The original closing date was extended to ensure farmers had the maximum opportunity to avail of the derogation in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">There are other options available to farmers who estimate that they may exceed the 170 kgs limit, such as exporting slurry or taking additional land. It is essential that farmers take early action in such cases. My Department has established a Farm Advisory System (as required under Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003) by training a large number of agricultural advisors/consultants in all aspects of cross compliance. These advisors are listed on my Departments website. Where farmers are in any doubt about their situation or the possible options, it is strongly recommended that they talk to their farm advisor.</p>

            <p eId="para_4117">The Nitrates Regulations (S.I. No. 101 of 2009) are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance. The objective of the Regulations is to protect water quality and the various provisions are designed to control the management of fertilisers, including the timing, method of application and maximum amounts that may be applied, in order to prevent nutrient losses to ground and surface waters. The Regulations give legal effect to Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4118">The EU Nitrates Directive requires Member States' Nitrates Action Programmes to include rules regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  The purpose of these prohibited periods is to ensure that fertilisers are not applied at times of the year when there is little or no growth and crops are not able to use them, and when there is a high risk of those fertilisers finding their way into waters instead. Outside of these prohibited periods, fertilisers may be applied to land provided that weather and ground conditions are suitable and that buffer zones, as specified in the Regulations, are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4119">The Regulations were the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the farming bodies, and were finalised following negotiations with the EU Commission.

            <p eId="para_4122">In relation to the Cawley report, the Seafood Strategy Implementation Group (SSIG) was set up in 2007 under the chairmanship of Dr Noel Cawley, comprised of stakeholders from all sectors of the industry as well as representatives from the relevant state agencies and from my Department. The group is charged with overseeing and driving the implementation of the strategic recommendations contained in the Cawley Report.  Substantial progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the completion of a decommissioning scheme which was a  key recommendations of the Cawley report.   Implementing certain strategies contained in the Cawley report  involves State support for the sector and progress in these areas will be dependent on  the availability of funds.  However, many of the measures involve improved practices, improved organisation and better co-ordination and co-operation and are not dependent on public funds.

            <p eId="para_4133">Although the Deputy refers to "forestry grants" I presume that he is referring to the recent decision to reduce the annual forestry premium by 8%.  The Supplementary Budget in April reduced the funding available for the Forestry Programme in 2009 and it was necessary for my Department to ensure that this allocation is spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. I decided to maintain the Afforestation Grant Scheme given its employment potential and contribution to climate change mitigation and funding for this in 2009 remains in place.  The reduction in annual premiums was one of a number of measures that were necessary to take to deal with the new budgetary position.</p>

            <p eId="para_4135">An application was received on the 15 May 2008 requesting the transfer of 12.42 Single Payment Scheme entitlements to the person named from his late father.  As the person named was not the legal owner of a herd-number, he was advised to contact his District Veterinary Office to request the transfer of the herd-number from his late father to himself. As the requested transfer of entitlements was by way of inheritance, the person named was also asked to supply the normal testamentary documentation in support of his claim. In addition, the transfer form was incomplete and this was returned with a request that the executor of the estate also sign it.</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">As the person named did not obtain a herd-number during the 2008 Scheme year, it was not possible to process the transfer of entitlements for that year and consequently the application was rejected. Any Single Payment Scheme payments due for 2008 and previous years will be allowed to issue to the representatives, of the father of the person named. To allow these payments to issue, the person named must supply a copy of Probate or, if not available, alternative documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">While the Transfer of Entitlement application could be processed under the 2009 scheme year, to date the person named has not supplied a copy of his late father's Will or Probate or any other related documentation. In addition, the person named is still not in possession of a herd-number.  When the person named supplies the normal documentation required to prove his entitlement to the Single Payment previously held by his father, and when he obtains a herd-number, the application to transfer entitlements will be processed without delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_4141">EU legislation governing intra community trade in cattle prescribes the conditions for trade and these rules also apply to the importation of water buffaloes from the UK.  All cattle imported into Ireland from the UK must be accompanied by an official health certificate from DEFRA as the competent authority of the exporting country confirming that the animals have undergone all appropriate tests and have not come from an area affected by any animal disease.  In the case of bovines (including water buffaloes) such tests include bovine TB, brucellosis and leucosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4142">In addition, all of the territory of Great Britain is included in a bluetongue Protection Zone. As such, additional certification for this disease applies to susceptible animals (including water buffaloes) from such zones. As Ireland is free of bluetongue it has availed of arrangements whereby it can limit the type of animals to be imported to those under 90 days old OR to those who have proven natural or vaccinal immunity to bluetongue (and only then if they pass particular pre-export tests and are treated with insecticide prior to and during transport). These immune animals will not develop a viraemia. Additional rules apply to female animals due to the established risk of possible transplacental transmission of bluetongue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4143">Certification issues will arise regarding vaccination of water buffalo for bluetongue.  It is my understanding that the current EMEA approved vaccines for bluetongue are not authorised for water buffalo. However as the intended import is from the UK it is a matter for DEFRA to decide on this matter. If DEFRA cannot certify vaccination, they will not be in a position to issue a health certificate thus export of this species from Great Britain to Ireland cannot take place or will be confined to animals under 90 days old.</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">I have consistently advised that all importers should not import any animals from bluetongue-affected areas as the highest risk of the introduction of the disease into Ireland is via an imported animal. By so doing they are putting their farms and the entire industry in jeopardy. If importers choose to ignore this advice and post-import testing shows that an imported animal is bluetongue virus positive, it will be immediately slaughtered without compensation. Importers should be aware of the financial exposure as well as the disease risk they are facing both to their own herd and to the national herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_4150">My Department is responsible for the operation of EU harmonized controls on imports of products of animal origin for human consumption. These are applied under its service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and in compliance with the Community's rules for the hygiene of food and feed. The FSAI, under service contracts with its official agencies, including this Department, enforces legislation requiring country of origin labelling of imported meat.  EU hygiene of food rules stipulate that food products of animal origin from EU sources must be traceable, come from an approved food business establishment, be health marked and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or by a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_4151">In the case of importation from third countries all products of animal origin are required to be submitted for import control at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) following prior notification. The checks applied at the BIP ensure they have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment (with the exception of honey), have been appropriately labelled and transported and are accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation and signed by the Competent Authority of the country responsible for the guarantees. The checks include documentary, identity and physical checks as well as sampling of imported products for analysis under the national residue monitoring programme or EU safeguard measures, when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_4152">Import consignments remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU. Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4158">In 2008 my Department awarded particular financial support to the small meat sector, which includes small slaughterhouses and low throughput meat establishments. Following a call for applications in December 2007, and a detailed selection and evaluation process in 2008, my Department awarded a total of €7.8m in grant assistance to 31 enterprises.  This funding will assist food business operators in the sector to improve efficiency, add quality and value to products, produce new and innovative products and develop new markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4159">The awards of €69 million under the Beef and Sheepmeat Investment Fund, which were announced recently, are part of a strategy to position the industry to face the challenges and grasp the opportunities that lie ahead. This grant aid will contribute to an actual investment in projects in the region of €168 million. The objective of the Fund is to support capital investment to increase scale and efficiency in primary processing, and to increase added value in further processing for retail, food service and manufacturing outlets. The investments are expected to increase net sales and exports by €400 million and ensure a net expansion in employment, with over 800 additional jobs to be provided by 2012 when the investment package is due to be completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4160">Each application for the Beef and Sheepmeat Investment Fund was carefully considered and all eligible projects were assessed and evaluated according to strict commercial and technical criteria by an expert committee comprising members from Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Bord Bia, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, private industry and an academic expert.</p>
            <p eId="para_4161">The funding awarded is being provided over a multi-annual period. In the case of eligible capital investments carried out up to 31 December 2008, grant aid will be paid out at the latest by 30 June 2010.  Grant aid in respect of eligible capital investments carried out after 31 December 2008 will be paid out in the years 2011-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4162">Grant payments, which fit within the timelines above, will only be made when: All the conditions relating to the executed grant agreement covering the grant approvals are fulfilled by the promoters.  The normal submission of independent auditors certification and supporting schedules of the costs which have been expended.  A formal inspection by the Enterprise Ireland inspection team of the assets upon which grant is being claimed and their satisfaction that the assets are in place, are in line with the objectives of the investment programme and represent good value for money.  Payments can be made on an instalment basis so as to facilitate the cash flow requirements of projects and in line with the actual expenditure actually undertaken.  It is expected that the final grant amounts will be expended in 2012 or 2013 depending on the speed of actual investment by the beneficiaries.</p>

This application was successful resulting in the granting of 18.16 National Reserve entitlements.

An application was received on 23 February 2009 requesting Force Majeure in relation to the five-year restriction on trading of National Reserve entitlements. The person named supplied medical evidence in support of this application.

            <p eId="para_4271">Grant aid was made available to the meat processing sector in the last 12 months under two funding programmes following detailed selection and evaluation processes.  A grant aid scheme for the small meat sector, which includes small slaughterhouses and low throughput meat establishments, culminated in my Department awarding a total of €7.8m in grant assistance to 31 enterprises in December 2008. Details are at Appendix 1.  The awards will assist the meat businesses to improve efficiency, add quality and value to products, produce new and innovative products and develop new markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4272">Under the Beef and Sheepmeat Investment Fund, grant assistance of over €69 million was recently announced in respect of 15 investment projects, each exceeding €2 million.  The awards, which are part of a strategy to position the industry to face the challenges and grasp the opportunities that lie ahead, will contribute to total investment in the region of €168 million.  The objective of the Fund is to support investment to increase scale and efficiency in primary processing, and added value in further processing for retail, food service and manufacturing outlets.  No overall increase in processing capacity within the sector is envisaged.  The individual investments supported by the Fund will have a range of impacts on sales and employment.  The overall net impact planned by companies in this multi-annual programme of investment is expected to achieve over €400 million in additional sales and exports and a net expansion of 800 in employment following completion of the package of investments in 2012.  Details of the awards are at appendix 2.  For reasons of commercial confidentiality and because the investments will take place over a number of years it would not be appropriate to provide further details of individual projects at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_4273">The awards carry the condition that beneficiaries undertake not to dispose of equipment or buildings in respect of which grant aid has been paid for a period of five years from the date that the final grant instalment is payable or is paid.</p>

            <p eId="para_4499">Scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicated that the European eel stock is now outside safe biological limits.  It advised that a recovery plan be developed for the whole stock of European eel and that exploitation and other human activities affecting the stock be reduced to as close to zero as possible.  As required under EU Council Regulation, Ireland submitted a Government approved draft Eel Management Plan to the Commission for approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">Last month two bye-laws were introduced to give effect to the National Eel Management Plan put in place to protect our dwindling eel stocks.  These closed the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012.  The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  Under the Regulation, all aspects of the Plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  At that stage, the bye-laws which were introduced to close the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012 will be reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">The ESB, as part of their implementation of the eel plan, have recently advertised for tenders to undertake trap and transport operations.  Ambitious targets have been set within the plan including the trapping and transport of at least 40 tonnes of eel around the turbines at Ardnacrusha and Ballyshannon.  Experienced eel fishermen would be in a very strong position to tender competitively for the provision of the trap and transport operations.  There will also be a limited amount of fishing associated with the research and monitoring to be carried out under the plan.  This will be in the region of 150 man days spread over six river basin districts.</p>

I have also announced that a special ex-gratia payment not exceeding 3.5 per cent of the value of the deferred amount will be made to farmers whose Farm Waste Management grants have been partially deferred.

            <p eId="para_4507">My Department does not provide specific grants to schools for swimming. Schools, such as that referred to by the Deputy, have flexibility to prioritise their needs and to use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of the curriculum, including Physical Education.  Primary school capitation grants have been increased substantially in recent years.  The primary school capitation grant has increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200, which was an increase of €21 on last year.  This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</p>

            <p eId="para_4512">The details sought by the Deputy relating to schools in the Dublin 15 area whose applications were approved for funding under the current Summer Works Scheme are included in a tabular statement relating to the complete Fingal Area. It would not be appropriate at this stage to make public the level of funding approved for schools as to do so might compromise the tendering process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4513">Details of the unsuccessful schools in the Dublin 15 area are given in a second tabular statement.  Unsuccessful applications generally fall into two categories:</p>
            <p eId="para_4514">Invalid applications;</p>
            <p eId="para_4515">Unapproved applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_4516">Applications are deemed invalid where schools do not submit an application consistent with the terms of the Scheme.  Most commonly, schools apply for works which are not within the scope of the scheme or they have not engaged suitably qualified Consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4517">The Department operates a free phone service each year for schools to assist them in completing application forms and to provide general information on the Scheme to avoid the submission of invalid applications as far as possible. Frequently Asked Questions are published on my Department's website and the governing Circular Letter also contains full details in relation to qualifying applications.  Unapproved applications generally arise where the works had already been completed under another funding mechanism or where the works were deemed not to be absolutely necessary at this point in time.  Letters issue to the individual schools setting out the reasons why their applications are unsuccessful and a school may appeal the decision made in its case if it so wishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4518">The Deputy will be aware that €80m will be spent on 1,180 projects in 967 schools this year.  This investment will improve structural, mechanical, electrical, gas and other works in schools right across the country.  I have already announced that, later this year, I will invite applications for a 2010 Summer Works Scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4661">The latest Retention Report published by the Department of Education and Science provides data on the cohort of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 1997, 1998 and 1999 most of whom completed their senior cycle five to six years following the year of intake.  This is the third such report tracking pupil retention and the trend is showing yearly improvements in retention rates — rising from an estimated 81 to 84% for entrants to second level in 1996 and 1999 respectively.  It is compiled from data on the Department's Post Primary Pupils Database and tracks students in State aided schools (with an estimate of those attaining their Leaving Cert in private institutions).  It does not take into account students pursuing other educational pathways such as Youthreach or apprenticeship training.  Retention rates of pupils in Second-Level School 1999 Cohort can be found on my Department's website — www.education.ie under Statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_4662">Average retention rates to leaving certificate for Dublin City, Dublin South, Dublin Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown for the 1999 Entry cohort were 72.1%, 74.6%, 80.7% and 83.2% respectively.  Retention rates for each Dublin postcode area have not been published in the most recent Report due to concerns about the use of such information to narrowly compare individual schools without taking full account of other differences.  Data relating to the cohort of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2000 and 2001 will be available in August.</p>
            <p eId="para_4663">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving.  This includes the work of the National Educational Welfare Board, established under the Education Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school.  Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS.  Targeted interventions include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison services, visiting teacher service for Travellers, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options.</p>
            <p eId="para_4664">On Monday 18th May, I announced that from the start of the next school year, in September 2009, a single co-ordinated School Support Programme involving the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion Programme and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers will be integrated under the National Educational Welfare Board.  This development will put in place structures to facilitate closer integration of the services at local, regional and national levels, increase effectiveness and help bring about real and meaningful improvements in services to confront in a cohesive way the underlying causes that impact negatively on the school life of children, particularly as they relate to school attendance, retention and attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4665">My Department has also widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.  I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years to keep more young people in school and I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

This has been the standard size for rooms constructed in recent years. It allows plenty of space for the range of activities carried out under the modern school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4671">The Professional and Technical staff in my Department continuously review and update the design of school buildings in general.  A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception.  These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works.  The level of facilities to be provided in schools will vary depending on the brief of accommodation needed for the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_4673">As the Deputy will be aware, the general allocation model was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs including children with mild general learning disabilities.  When the model commenced, a commitment was given to carry out a review after three years of operation.  This review commenced in 2008.  The process involves engaging with the Education Partners which includes parent, management and union interests in the context of securing their views on the model's operation. It is expected that the review will be completed in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4674">Where schools meet the criteria for Developing School Status as outlined in Department circular 0002/2009, an appropriate adjustment will automatically be made to the school's allocation under the General Allocation Model.

            <p eId="para_4680">I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to support from a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.  Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.  These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_4681">All children with MGLD who are in the classes being suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model.  Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature.  My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4682">All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  A pupil's whose educational needs falls within the low incidence disability category may be entitled to additional teaching support through the National Council for Special Education.  In such circumstances, a school makes  an application for this resource to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO).  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4683">I wish to reiterate that pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have, access to additional teaching resources to support their education.  However, there is a requirement to make appropriate use of the resources available and along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is dependent on the resources available to the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_4697">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4698">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4699">Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4700">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street,  Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  I understand that in this instance, the NEWB is working closely with the family concerned in seeking an alternative school placement and that applications have been made to a number of schools to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_4707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 617 to 622, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4708">A total of 12 companies tendered for the bundle of schools (which included the two primary schools for Gorey) under the rapid delivery programme in 2008.  Information on the tender prices of the unsuccessful tenders is commercially sensitive and it would be inappropriate of me to release such information as it could undermine future tender competitions.  A school building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc.  In general all sub-contractors employed on school building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4709">It is a matter for all sub-contractors to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the Main Contractor or with the entity with whom they are in contract.  The Department has no control over sub-contracts entered into by the main contractor and holds no information relating to same.  There is no contractual relationship between my Department and any of the sub-contractors engaged on the projects to which the Deputy refers.  As such, I am satisfied that no responsibility or power rests with my Department to resolve contractual issues relating to those sub-contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4710">Regarding the number of contracts placed by the Department with the company in question and detailed information on each tender process, information relating to the tender and award process for projects is held on individual project files.  There is no centralised database where such information is recorded.  It would take an inordinate amount of administrative resources to examine each individual file to obtain the information requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4711">It should be noted, also, that the vast majority of contracts for both major and minor school's capital projects are between individual school authorities and main contractors and are placed following a public tendering process operated by the school authorities  in conjunction with their design team.  Generally, my Department is the contracting authority only in those cases where the property/site is in the ownership of the Minister for Education &amp; Science.</p>

            <p eId="para_4727">The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.  Home tuition was not sanctioned for the child in question as he did not meet the criteria under the terms of the scheme. Additional information subsequently submitted to support the application is currently under consideration by my officials. A decision will be conveyed to the parent as soon as this process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4729">I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of the school concerned. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4730">Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The responsibility also includes identifying appropriate educational placements for individual children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4731">My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education. It is open to the parents concerned to raise any queries they may have relating to their child's special educational needs directly with the school authorities or with the local SENO. The parent may contact the SENO using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_4750">My Department estimates that approximately €48m will be spent this year on the rental of school accommodation. The funding is to cover costs relating to continuing existing rentals and any new approvals for the next school year. It is too early at this stage to provide details of new school approvals for the coming year.  Details of the schools currently renting temporary accommodation are given in the attached tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4751">Schools requiring additional temporary accommodation from next September must apply to my Department for approval. An application form can be downloaded for completion from my Departments website at www.education.ie. The school should indicate in a covering letter any particular issues involved such site issues. It should also demonstrate to my Department why the additional accommodation is required such as for increasing pupil numbers resulting in the appointment of an additional teacher etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_4752">A number of factors are taken into account in determining an appropriate size for a prefabricated primary school classroom such as curricular development, the pupil/teacher ratio and the fact that the number of pupils in a classroom may vary from year to year to take account of departing classes, and new enrolments. Generally it is the current practice of my Department to use a guideline of 80m2 as a standard size of general classroom. This is sufficiently large to comfortably cater for a class size in excess of 30 pupils. It should be stressed however that this is a guideline and it may not be possible or viable to achieve it particularly due to factors such as site constraints. It is also the case that where the accommodation is required for purposes other than as a general classroom the size of unit provided may vary.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that parents at a school (details supplied) in Dublin 15 have been notified that two classes are to be housed in another school building from September 2009 due to a shortage of space and that this school agreed to take on extra pupils on the basis that funds would be provided for the necessary extension and refurbishment; the timescale for the allocation of these funds and the completion of the project; when the classes will be re-housed in their own school building; his views on whether the separation of two classes from the rest of the school is far from optimal for the social and educational development of the pupils concerned; if funds have been allocated to these projects under the summer works scheme 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The classrooms which are currently being used by the second school will become vacant at the end of the current school year and both schools have agreed to their use by the first school from September.  The first school was allocated funding for window replacements under the Summer Works Scheme 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_12999">The Deputy will be aware that I have been anxious to develop this Centre to provide for the promotion of excellence in the development and harmonisation of education and associated services for children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders. A lot has been achieved already in collaboration with the Department of Education, Northern Ireland, with the Centre currently delivering training programmes and commissioning research.  Our current economic climate has meant a thorough review of all educational projects and programmes requiring expenditure. Given the competing demands within the education sector and the overall demands on Government finances, it has not proven possible to provide additional funding to fully develop all projects currently underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_13000">The outcome of this process means that, unfortunately, my Department is not in a position to provide the funding required to expand the Middletown Centre as had been intended this year or to enable the capital project to proceed as planned. I wish to assure the Deputy that this decision does not mean that funding is been withdrawn from Middletown and it will continue to be enabled to provide services and, indeed, to develop some additional services. My Department is anxious to ensure the continuation of ongoing training and research programmes.  The Department will, of course, keep the expansion of the Middletown Centre under review in the context of improved financial circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_13002">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September of the previous school year. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools takes place in the autumn of each year and enables the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins each September.</p>
            <p eId="para_13003">This process involves my Department writing to schools in the early part of each calendar year.  The final position for any one school is dependent on a number of other factors such as additional posts for primary schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_13004">It would not be feasible to carry out the above process in advance of the start of each school year if the date for calculation of teacher numbers was changed to 31 May.  However, I want to assure the Deputy that the current system at primary level takes account of the needs of schools that have rapidly rising enrolments by the allocation of developing posts to these schools based on current year enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_13005">I am of course committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools in as timely a fashion as possible and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of teachers to schools. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_13009">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education has been requested by my Department to arrange for its Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) to review special needs assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met. I wish to clarify that there has been no change in these criteria and the current review will be carried out by reference to those criteria. The review is currently underway and it is intended that it will be completed during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_13010">SNAs are sanctioned by SENOs to schools specifically to assist in the care of pupils and students with disabilities in an educational context. SNAs may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream school to assist school authorities in making suitable provision for children who have been assessed as having such needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13011">For some pupils, as they mature, their care needs may diminish over time. Pupils may move to a different school or on to a post-primary school. In such circumstances, the NCSE will review and adjust the overall level of SNA support in the school concerned. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13012">A value for money and policy analysis review of the SNA scheme is also underway.  This is a comprehensive review of the rationale for this scheme, including the role of the SNA, and is expected to be completed during this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_13016">People who were in foster care as children were covered by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 and had access to both the Investigative and Confidential Committees of the Commission.  During the passage of the legislation governing the establishment of the Redress Scheme (Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002) through both Houses, the issue of including children who were in foster care was discussed and it was decided not to extend the legislation, as children in foster care were not in a residential institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_13017">Having said that, however, under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, special provision is made relating to the "residence" requirement.  One such provision states that abuse of a child "in an institution" includes any case in which the abuse took place, not in the institution itself, but while the child was residing or being cared for in the institution and the abuse was committed or aided by a person engaged in the management or supervision of the institution or a person otherwise employed in or associated with the institution.  I understand that this covers persons who were officially resident in a scheduled institution but who may have been temporarily placed outside the institution during the period of their residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_13018">As I have pointed out previously, a person's ineligibility to be considered for an award under the terms of the Redress Scheme does not effect their statutory right to pursue any other legal avenues which may be open to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_13022">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department did consider the inclusion of this institution on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002.  This particular institution, as with many others listed, did not operate under the jurisdiction of my Department and, consequently, it was necessary for officials at my Department to consult with other Government Departments to ascertain their eligibility for inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_13023">Section 4(1) of the Residential institutions Redress Act, 2002, states that the Minister for Education &amp; Science, may, by Order, provide for the insertion of any industrial school, reformatory, orphanage, children's home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</p>
            <p eId="para_13024">In relation to the orphanage referred to by the Deputy, my Department consulted with the Department of Health and Children to ascertain if it was eligible to be considered for inclusion on the Schedule.  It appears that this institution actually operated as a Mother and Baby Home which was a privately operated facility.  The institution did not satisfy the terms of the criteria referred to above and consequently, it was not considered to be eligible for inclusion.  I should however point out that ineligibility to be considered for redress under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, does not affect a person's statutory right to pursue other legal avenues which may be open to them.</p>

The building project for the above school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  I met with a deputation from the school last October when the school's situation was fully outlined.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13027">However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.  In the meantime, however, the school authority has been informed that it is open to it to apply to the Planning and Building Unit of my Department for emergency works funding for capital works of an urgent nature. Grants from this fund are available for very urgent works, primarily of a major health and safety nature, to schools that require them.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_13031">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. There are 876 schools in DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (199 Urban Band 1, 141 Urban Band 2 and 333 Rural) and 203 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13032">Primary schools serving rural communities, including towns with populations below 1,500, are designated as rural.  The indicators used in identifying schools for participation in DEIS took into account the differences between urban and rural disadvantage.  The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), as: "the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from the education in schools".</p>
            <p eId="para_13033">Educational disadvantage is present in both the urban and rural context in Ireland. Both urban and rural disadvantage share many characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment and poor housing conditions, but there are also a number of ways in which rural disadvantage differs from urban disadvantage.  Firstly, in rural areas, disadvantage may occur in single families or in small pockets.   Secondly it is usually widely dispersed.  As a result, its presence and effects will be less noticeable than in urban areas where it appears in a concentrated form.  Thirdly, disadvantage in rural areas may be associated with a degree of isolation from a range of services available in towns and cities.  As a result the school commute may prove problematic, while the availability of other services may be very limited or non-existent.  Isolation and dispersal also present difficulties when it comes to providing intervention to help pupils cope with disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_13034">The pupil teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes (infants through second-class) and 24:1 in senior classes (third through sixth-class) apply to the 199 urban/town primary schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  The rationale for this decision is to ensure that resources are targeted in particular, though not exclusively, at schools where disadvantage is most concentrated.  For schools other than those that benefit from lower PTR under DEIS, the mechanism used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools is the staffing schedule and with effect from September 2009 the enrolment bands will be based on an average of 28 pupils per class teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_13035">In the current climate my Department's main focus is to retain, where possible, key resources in the schools targeted under the DEIS initiative. This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on Primary Disadvantage in 2006, which suggested that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged.</p>

            <p eId="para_13037">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_13038">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_13039">Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_13040">I understand that in this instance, that a Section 29 appeal has been lodged on behalf of the child concerned, and that the appeal will be heard on 22nd June, if agreement cannot be reached in the interim.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_13042">I wish to advise the Deputy that Section 8(1) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that all applications should be made to the Board within 3 years of the establishment date.  Consequently, the closing date for receipt of applications expired on 15th December 2005.  Significant public notice and advertisement was given of this date.  However, there is provision under Section 8(2) and (3) of the Act for the making of late applications to the Board in exceptional circumstances.  As the Board is completely independent in the performance of its functions, it is entirely a matter for the Board as to whether individual late applications may be accepted.</p>
            <p eId="para_13043">The issue as to whether any further arrangement should be made in relation to extending the period for making late applications to the Redress Board was among a range of issues raised by representatives of survivor groups when they met with the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers recently.

            <p eId="para_13051">The details sought by the Deputy relating to schools from the area in question whose applications were approved for funding and those that were unsuccessful under the current Summer Works Scheme are contained in the following tabular statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_13052">Unsuccessful applications generally fall into two categories:</p>
            <p eId="para_13053">Invalid applications</p>
            <p eId="para_13054">Unapproved applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_13055">Applications are deemed invalid where schools do not submit an application consistent with the terms of the Scheme. Most commonly, schools apply for works which are not within the scope of the scheme or they have not engaged suitably qualified Consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_13056">The Department operates a free phone service each year for schools to assist them in completing application forms and to provide general information on the Scheme to avoid the submission of invalid applications as far as possible. Frequently Asked Questions are published on my Department's website and the governing Circular Letter also contains full details in relation to qualifying  applications.  Unapproved applications generally arise where the works had already been completed under another funding mechanism or where the works were deemed not to be absolutely necessary at this point in time.  Letters issue to the individual schools setting out the reasons why their applications are unsuccessful and a school may appeal the decision made in its case if it so wishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13057">The Deputy will be aware that €80m will be spent on 1,180 projects in 967 schools this year. This investment will improve structural, mechanical, electrical, gas and other works in schools right across the country. I have already announced that, later this year, I will invite applications for a 2010 Summer Works Scheme.</p>

         the average class size in north Tipperary schools; the pupil/teacher ratio in schools in the same constituency; the way it compares with international best practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_13304">Information in relation to average class size and pupil teacher ratio is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2008/2009) are currently being compiled by my Department and the final outcome will be available later in the summer. The average class size in North Tipperary in 2007/2008 was 23.2.  Pupil Teacher Ratio in respect of all primary schools is currently only available at national level and not  disaggregated by county or any other variable. The PTR at first level in 2007/2008 was 16.0.</p>
            <p eId="para_13305">The Deputy has introduced the issue of comparability of Irish pupil/teacher ratios with the position in schools internationally.  I have to say to the House that given the momentous challenges that most countries are facing to cope with economic recession, and in the case of some countries to even maintain financial solvency, raising the matter of educational comparisons misses the point.  The first priority for Governments throughout the world at present is to ensure economic survival. Ensuring that public services like education can be maintained at a reasonable level is but a subset of that greater priority of securing national solvency. Without economic and fiscal stability is axiomatic that public services like education will suffer.</p>
            <p eId="para_13306">The Government is about the business of securing Ireland's future. It is the number one priority. In the budget we tried to shelter education services as best we could. Some changes to how schools are to be staffed from next September were unavoidable.  Of course it would be desirable to make improvements as originally intended let alone have to take a step back. However this is a changed world and it would be sheer folly to allow the overall number of teachers spiral upwards as if nothing had changed. I have faith in the quality of our teachers and our schools and in their capacity to deliver as well from September 2009 as they did just over a year ago from a similar level staffing and class size position.  We need to come through this difficult period and then and only then can we look at what further improvements we can make in how we staff schools and reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13307">As the full extent of the global crisis seeps into public consciousness I believe that parents will accept that taking difficult decisions now in order to secure future economic prosperity and secure employment for them and ultimately their children is the first imperative of Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_13309">The Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) was established in 2006 with a major emphasis on promoting inter-institutional collaboration in bringing about substantial change and quality improvement within the Irish higher education system.  Projects approved under the Fund are aimed at institutional reform, enhancing teaching and learning, improving access and life long learning and enabling the development of fourth level activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_13310">There have been two cycles of funding approved under the SIF to date. Cycle 1 was approved in October 2006 with an allocation of €42 million and cycle 2 was approved in February 2008 with an allocation of €101 million.   I have attached, for the information of the Deputy, details of the projects that were approved under cycles 1 and 2, and details of funding provided to date by my Department to the lead institutions for these projects.</p>

The deputation was advised that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently identifying the areas throughout the  country where significant additional accommodation will be needed at primary and post primary level in the medium to long term. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolment, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.

            <p eId="para_13686">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_13687">My Department has no record of receiving a recommendation for laptops for pupils with special educational needs attending the school in question.  The existing assistive technology scheme is targeted at individual circumstances where pupils have very specific educational needs and the purpose of the grant-aid is to provide the pupils in question with equipment of direct educational benefit to them.  Grant aid in accordance with this scheme is provided for individual pupils with special educational needs. The scheme does  not extend to the provision of laptops for resource classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13688">Under my Department's School Building Programme, new post-primary school buildings projects include ICT equipment budgets and as the Deputy may also be aware, some €2.2m was recently provided in ICT equipment grants to 72 primary schools in which a newly constructed school or large-scale extension was completed in 2008. Grants were also issued to some 500 post-primary schools to upgrade their facilities to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus with effect from September 2007. It is understood that some 11,000 computers have been acquired in this context, with schools using their own funding in some instances. In addition, the Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties includes ICT equipment within the range of approved school expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_13689">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_13691">Under the terms of my Departments Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved undergraduate courses in the State.  One of the main conditions of the scheme is that students must be first-time undergraduates.   Therefore where a student already holds an undergraduate qualification, regardless of when obtained, they are not eligible for free tuition fees under the scheme.  The Deputy may be aware that Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate courses.</p>

            <p eId="para_13693">I can confirm to the Deputy that a letter dated 13th May from the Principal Teacher of the school in question relating to additional funding has been received in my Department.  As part of the expansion of the Small Schools Scheme, a grant was sanctioned in March 2007 under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme to enable the management authority of the school to build 3 permanent classrooms.  The initiative allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project.</p>
            <p eId="para_13694">The letter in question is being treated as an appeal and the school will be informed of the decision as soon as possible.

            <p eId="para_13696">The application procedures for entry to third level undergraduate courses including the closing dates applicable to different classifications of applicant are determined by the individual third level institutions.  While the initial CAO closing date is 1 February, late applications are accepted up to 1 May and 5,945 such applications were received this year, an increase of 51% on 2008. On 2 July next the CAO will publish details of its Available Place  courses where places are likely to be available following the first round of CAO offers in August. A further opportunity will be available for people to apply for places on such courses from 18 August 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_13697">Where applications are made through the CAO the closing dates are the same for both EU and non-EU applicants. However, applicants seeking entry on grounds of mature years may be subject to an additional assessment procedure to determine eligibility and may be required to apply directly to the institution concerned.  Many institutions also require EU and non-EU applicants presenting examination results other than the Leaving Certificate, FETAC and GCE to apply by 1 February in order to allow time for assessment of the qualification based on submitted documentation. Where Institutions require non-EU students to apply directly to the institution the closing date for such direct applications is determined by the institution concerned and varies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13698">A range of initiatives have already been put in place to assist unemployed people engage in upskilling in the third level sector.  These include the rolling out of a range of accelerated level 6 programmes between February and April this year which afforded unemployed persons the opportunity to complete the first year of a standard two year programme in an accelerated manner so that they can move to the second year of the programme in September 2009. The majority of these courses are 15 weeks duration with exams being held over 1/2 weeks. These programmes are currently running in the Institutes of Technology in Athlone, Carlow, Letterkenny and Sligo. The cost of the programmes are being met from within existing resources and there is no charge to participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_13699">Institutes of Technology are also utilising spare capacity to provide over 900 places on a range of newly developed part time transition programmes. These programmes have been developed to assist unemployed people who may be some time out of the formal education system to find out more about the type of third level courses that may be suited to them and to build their confidence to return to education by developing some of the necessary skills for studying at third level. Courses are free of charge to participants. It is hoped that a significant number of participants on these courses will be encouraged to apply for a range of third level certificate and degree programmes commencing in September 2009. The programmes are being run on a part time basis, with  participants remaining available for opportunities to re-enter employment. The courses are being delivered over a period of 10 to 15 weeks with participants committed to between 6 and 10 contact hours per week. These programmes are currently running in the Institutes of Technology in Blanchardstown, Carlow, Cork, Dun Laoghaire, Galway-Mayo, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tallaght, Tralee and in  DIT.</p>
            <p eId="para_13700">The accelerated programmes and third level transition courses are targeted specifically at unemployed persons. The Institutes have worked closely with local FÁS and Department of Social and Family Affairs offices both in terms of marketing the courses and advising participants of their entitlements in relation to social welfare payments. Further information on these programmes is also available directly from the participating Institutes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13701">In addition, 1,500 places will be provided to enable persons who are unemployed to pursue third level certificate or degree programmes on a part time basis. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide funding to support this initiative and arrangements for the operation of the programme are being developed jointly by officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to implementation from September 2009.  The scope to further develop these initiatives and to identify other appropriate responses which the third level sector can make to support the up-skilling of unemployed people is being examined by a Higher Education Labour Market Response Group which I have asked the HEA to establish and to report to me by the end of June.</p>

            <p eId="para_13703">The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf, facilitates the transportation of over 135,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day. School transport is a very significant operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million  kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.  The introduction of the annual charge which replaces the term payment system  will enable Bus Éireann to streamline the current payments system and the allocation of tickets. It will also ensure that route planning and seating arrangements are managed in a more efficient and cost effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_13704">The revised charges have been confined to eligible post-primary children and children availing of concessionary transport. Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs will still travel free. A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_13705">School transport ticket invoices for the 2009/2010 School Year will be issued by Bus Éireann in July 2009. The payment options being offered to parents are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_13706">Payment of the full amount by the deadline date of 31 July 2009</p>
            <p eId="para_13707">Spreading the amount due over two payments payable in July and December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_13708">Parents who pay the full annual charge, in advance, will benefit from ticket(s) being issued for the full school year. This arrangement includes pupils on concessionary travel.  Parents who pay 50% of the annual amount by the deadline date of 31 July, 2009  will be issued with a ticket valid for travel up to 22 December, 2009. The balance due must be paid by 4th December, 2009. Upon receipt of this payment a second ticket valid for travel up to the end of the school year in June, 2010 will be issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_13709">On-line payment facilities have been introduced by Bus Éireann to make it more convenient for parents to make their payment from home, if desired. This facility is made available when ticket invoices are issued and the option to use a credit or debit card is offered. While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, given the factors that I have outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements as outlined above.</p>

            <p eId="para_13716">The online application fee for post graduate courses varies between universities and is currently in the range of €35.00 to €37.50.  In general the fee charged will cover applications for between 3 and 5 programmes of study within an individual institution.  Applicant suitability for the majority of postgraduate courses is generally assessed on the applicants' own merits, and may include consideration of completed projects, relevant work experience, or other relevant criteria.  Therefore, it is not readily converted to a numeric score as is done by the CAO for applicants to undergraduate courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_13717">The Postgraduate Applications Centre (www.pac.ie) provides a central applications point for taught and research programmes in DCU, UCC, NUIG, NUIM and TCD.  Unlike the CAO process, applications through the PAC or directly to institutions are entirely independent of each other, which affords students flexibility in applying for and accumulating offers before making their choice.

            <p eId="para_13719">The annual charges for school transport services are being increased from the first term of the 2009/10 school year as follows: Eligible post-primary pupils (junior) from €168 to €300 (78% increase) Eligible post-primary pupils (senior) from €234 to €300 (28% increase) Concessionary post-primary pupils from €234 to €300 (28% increase) Concessionary primary pupils from €120 to €200 (66% increase) Maximum family charge from €495 to €650 (31% increase).</p>
            <p eId="para_13720">The cost of school transport in 2009 is now estimated to be €192 million. However, this still represents a significant increase of over €82 million (over 75%) since 2004, up from €109.8 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_13721">I wish to point out that, despite the escalating costs of the service, charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school term in the 2007/08 school year.  A further increase was put in place at the start of the 2008/09 school year and the new charges come into effect from September 2009.  The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 will still only represent about 8.6% of the overall expenditure for school transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_13722">In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, charge increases have been confined to the eligible post-primary and children availing of concessionary transport.

            <p eId="para_13737">The school to which the Deputy refers has in fact been allocated an additional mainstream class post under the staffing schedule for the coming school year, 2009-2010.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in this regard earlier this year.  I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website.  The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_13738">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_13739">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_13740">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_13742">The provision of school meals which is primarily funded by the School Meals Programme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is among the many measures available to schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion and other schools included in older disadvantaged schemes.  Educational research has shown that good nutrition improves the concentration levels of students and that students from low-income families are less likely to have access to an adequate diet.  The provision of healthy school meals is therefore a priority for the Government in tackling educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_13743">The school to which the Deputy refers was among a number of schools that was judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS.  This school together with some 120 other schools retained resources, including the rural coordinator post under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.  When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative, i.e. 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_13744">However, in light of the recent economic downturn, the Government has had to make a number of difficult and challenging decisions in Budget 2009.  This means that it is now necessary to withdraw additional resources from all NON DEIS schools with effect from 31 August 2009.  These resources will be retained for the remainder of this school year after which they will then be withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_13745">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13746">For some pupils, as they mature, their care needs may diminish over time.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to a post-primary school.  In such circumstances, the NCSE will review and adjust the overall level of SNA support in the school concerned.  This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13747">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_13748">Under no circumstances should a school use funding provided under the School Meals Programme for other purposes.  Funding under the Department of Social and Family Affairs School Meals (Local Projects) Scheme is for food items only.  At the end of every school year, appropriate accounting records showing vouched income and expenditure for each school year must be submitted to the School Meals Section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Funding is provided to viable projects only.</p>
            <p eId="para_13749">Any school that no longer has a requirement for funding to provide school meals, should relinquish the funding to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for redispursement to other eligible schools in need of such supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_13751">As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.  The SCPA was first put in operation for the 2001/02 academic year as a temporary measure in advance of the full staffing of the NEPS service.</p>
            <p eId="para_13752">As the number of psychologists employed by NEPS has increased over the past two academic years the proportion of pupils in schools to whom a NEPS psychologist is assigned has increase for 67% to a current level of 84%.  The number of schools therefore availing of SCPA has dropped proportionately.  It is my intention to continue to expand the number of NEPS psychologists and consequently as the balance has changes between both elements of the service it has been decided to more closely align the processes of both.</p>
            <p eId="para_13753">In this regard my Department took the opportunity during the current academic year to refresh the panel of SCPA psychologists and changes made to the Parental Consent Process which would allow for NEPS to receive a copy of the assessment report by a psychologist on the panel.  Previously, copies were made available to the parent and the school involved and an anonymised certificate in respect of the assessment submitted to NEPS to allow for payment to the SCPA psychologist involved.  The retention of such individual pupil records is a normal practice for NEPS psychologists and lends itself the maintenance of a continuous record of involvement with a student throughout their school career.  Strict confidentiality is, of course, maintained in relation to these records.</p>
            <p eId="para_13754">The practice has now been extended to students who are assessed under the SCPA which, in turn, will enhance the future direct services provided by NEPS personnel to an increasing number of students and schools.  In addition the change in practice in this regard also allows for more rationalised quality control on the range of assessments provided and paid for by my Department under the SCPA.</p>

            <p eId="para_13764">As the Deputy may be aware a key focus and priority of my Department is to provide for resources in schools to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.  For mainstream primary schools, this is done through the General Allocation Model.  This model was introduced in September 2005 and ensures that mainstream primary schools have the additional teaching resources already in place to enable them cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_13765">It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgement to identify pupils that will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05, to schools to provide guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_13766">My Department also provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with dyslexia.  All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_13767">My Department supports teachers with additional training needs in the area of dyslexia.  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs.  The SESS provides fees' subsidies for the online training course, "Dyslexia: Identification and Early Interventions".  Fees' subsidies are also  provided for teachers to enable them to avail of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_13768">In addition, my Department provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment.  Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser (SENO) directly for this support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13769">The Deputy may be aware that my Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.  The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_13770">My Department has provided funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.

The purpose of the grant-aid is to provide such students with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Examples of such equipment include computers, word processors, tape recorders, software, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_13773">The scheme is driven by applications from schools on behalf of individual students, as and when specific needs present.  Following the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), all applications for assistive technology are submitted by school management to the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) with assigned responsibility for the school.  The SENO examines applications and makes a recommendation to my Department.  An application for a grant for assistive technology, made on behalf of the student referred to by the Deputy, has been examined by a SENO.  The SENO has concluded, based on documentation provided, that the student does not meet the criteria for a grant towards assistive technology.

            <p eId="para_13802">The Millennium Partnership Fund has been in operation since 2000. It forms part  of the European Social Fund-aided package for education disadvantage. Funding  for the scheme in 2001-02 was €1m. This increased to €2m in 2002-03. The  allocation for 2008-9 academic year was €2.18m. This allocation was distributed  among 56 Partnerships/community groups around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_13803">An external review of the Fund was commissioned by the Higher Education  Authority in 2005. The review concluded that while the fund has served an  important function in supporting students from disadvantaged areas to attend  further and higher education, it has significant potential to facilitate  outreach and role modelling if further developed within a holistic strategy to  combat educational disadvantage. The review recommended a more targeted  approach, focusing the fund on a rigorously selected sample of groups with a  strategic focus and good linkages with other stakeholders at community level.  It also identified the potential for the impact of the Fund to be considerably  enhanced through shifting the emphasis from retention to community-based access.</p>
            <p eId="para_13804">Following consultations with the various stakeholders, including local area  partnerships, third level institutions and relevant government agencies, my  Department, the National Access Office of the HEA and Pobal are currently  engaged in discussions on the future direction of the Fund, with a view to  developing a model for community-based access programmes. This work on the  development of the re-oriented fund is continuing and  discussions are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_13805">It is not proposed that a replacement fund focused on financial support will be  implemented following the re-orientation of the Millennium Partnership Fund to  a community-based access focused fund. However, financial assistance will  continue to be available for individual students including those currently  unemployed who wish to re-enter education, under the maintenance grant schemes  and the other access measures funded by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_13808">The correspondence to which the Deputy refers relates to the requirement for contractors to demonstrate economic capacity to carry out a project. Economic and Financial Standing is one of the criteria laid down in the EU Procurement Directives for pre-selection of contractors tendering for building contracts.  Contracting Authorities have an obligation to ensure that, as part of suitability assessment for placing on tender lists for projects, contractors  have adequate economic and financial capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_13809">One of the key criteria for assessing financial and economic capacity is the  average annual turnover of the contracting company over the previous three  years. The purpose of this is to ensure that the firm has adequate capacity and  will not be overstretched if it is successful in winning the tender  competition. Turnover is the measure of financial and economic standing  consistently used across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_13810">The turnover requirement for school building projects has been reduced  from 2.5 times the estimated contract value in 2007 to twice the estimated  contract value in 2009 and this is also reduced pro-rata for projects exceeding  12 months in duration (e.g. 1.5 times the estimated contract value for an 18  month contract). With pre-tender estimates (on which the turnover requirement  is calculated) also reflecting the significantly reduced tender levels, this  also serves to reduce, on an ongoing basis, the turnover threshold for  contractors applying for projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_13811">In the case of the school building project referred to by the Deputy, the  contract notice seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified  contractors has already been published on the public procurement portal  www.etenders.gov.ie. Therefore, in this instance, it is not possible to review  the tender conditions as the Contract Notice has already been placed and the  tender competition is underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_13818">I am pleased to confirm that my Department has recently provided funds to the Galway City Vocational Education Committee to enable them to close the sale on the site for the school mentioned by the Deputy. This school is included in my Department's PPP school building programme.  The make up and timing of further school bundles from this programme will be determined by my Department in consultation with the National Development  Finance Agency (NDFA). The issues to be considered in the timing and bundling of these schools include site availability for each school, geographical spread and the estimated total cost of the proposed school bundle.</p>

            <p eId="para_13820">The three third level student support schemes, administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third-level courses.  Financial assistance will continue to be available for individual students through the maintenance grant schemes, the Special Rate of maintenance grant, the Student Assistance Fund, the Fund for Students with Disabilities and the Department of Social and Family Affairs Back to Education Allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13821">Under the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 24 km or less from the college which he/she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in most other cases.</p>

        <b>Deputy Arthur Morgan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the situation of a school (details supplied) in County Galway which took in 48 pupils in 2008 after being told that was the figure needed in order for it to qualify for three teachers and which has now been told that the criterion has been changed to 49 pupils which will be applied retrospectively, meaning it faces losing one of its teachers; and if he will ensure that such criteria are not applied retrospectively.

            <p eId="para_13823">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_13824">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment  data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received  and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that  begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_13825">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public  detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now  published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the  details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain  128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my  intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final  position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_13826">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors  such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts  allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment  arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his  or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until  the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will  have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_13827">I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to  the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. Following consideration of the case at its  meeting on 14 May 2009, the Board refused the appeal. The Board of Management  of the school has been notified in this regard. The decision of the Appeal  Board is final.</p>
