          <p eId="para_16">This is a technical amendment to change the word "representative" to ensure consistency.  As for amendment No. 54, section 25(5) allows the Minister to nominate a person to fill a vacancy in the chair if it arises.  There is a technically incorrect reference as a consequence of section 25(7) and it needs adaptation.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Amendment No. 74 is a minor technical amendment for clarification purposes.  Section 38 provides for the removal of the CEO from office.  Amendment No. 82 is also a minor technical amendment to section 41 for clarification purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Although grouped with the others, amendment No. 88 is not a technical amendment and is designed to give certainty to NAMA and the taxpayer by specifying in the legislation the maximum amount of subordinated debt securities that can be issued by NAMA in consideration for the acquisition of bank assets.  That maximum is to be 5% of the amount of the consideration paid for the bank assets.  A balance must be struck between maximising the amount of risk shared and helping the economy by putting the financial system on track.  Subordinated bonds are a method of sharing the risk associated with NAMA.  They put the banks at risk if NAMA is to lose money, which is not our expectation, without giving them an upside on the gains.  It is important that we clarify the amount of subordinated debt not just as a matter of public interest or knowledge, but as a matter of certainty in the markets.  According to the accountancy advice available to the Government, there is an issue about going beyond 5%.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_19">When people heard about the 50:50 sharing of risk stridently announced by the Green Party, they felt that the Government was having a rethink about setting a long-term economic value and paying in excess for the assets.  People were dismayed to discover that, when the details emerged, the Minister was capping the amount of subordinated bonds at 5%.  I do not understand the basis for the 5% figure.  The Minister refers to mysterious advice.  If risk is shared, as was implicit in the proposal that seemed to have Government support, one leaves some of the risk on the banks' balance sheets and the Government might find itself in a position where it must take an increased shareholding.  The exchange is that the Government has more of the upside while the shareholders or bondholders holding the subordinated part have more risk in NAMA.  That was my understanding of what the Green Party was advocating and the direction of Government thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In effect, the 50:50 split was a way of not paying the €7 billion long-term economic value, cutting it down substantially while having to recapitalise and taking a bigger share of the banks.  In return, there would be a fairer arrangement of risk sharing, with the taxpayer having a large shareholding in the cleansed bank and the shareholders in the bank having a greater stake in NAMA.  If it did not go well, they would get nothing back on these subordinated bonds.  This seemed a sensible development in Government thinking, but it came to an abrupt end when we saw the detail and found that subordinated bonds were capped at 5% of the €54 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The advice about 5% must be exposed.  Even if it was true that some group of accountants would ignore subordinated bonds of less than €2.7 billion but would have a canary if it was more than this figure, this was an attempt to share the risk more fairly.  People would feel more comfortable with what the Green Party was advocating, a 50:50 share of the risk.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_23">This would have gained more political support for the NAMA process.  The Minister must be more explicit on why he feels a greater element of the subordinated bonds is not justified.  Professor Honohan, who is now Governor of the Central Bank, was very clear in his advice to the Government before his appointment.  He suggested the Government should pay a conservative price for the assets and, in return, it should take a more substantial shareholding in the banks and provide a substantial shareholding for the banks and their bondholders in NAMA.  That would have had a number of advantages by making NAMA less of a public bureaucracy that must be overseen.  It would be a joint venture with private interests having skin in the game.  This would have helped NAMA in many ways.  Asset recovery by bureaucracies or state-run entities have not been successful.  Numerous cases illustrate that the political elements succeed in subverting the original intentions of the asset recovery entity and it becomes soft on asset recovery.  This resulted in a state not recouping what had been hoped from the exercise.  Numerous examples from the IMF report on the subject back this up.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The Minister must explain more thoroughly why he did not adopt either a greater amount of subordinated bonds in his model or the model proposed by the then professor of international financial economics in Trinity College and now Governor of the Central Bank.  This had wide appeal and, for the first time, was bridging something of the difference between the solutions on either side of this House.  Professor Honohan's model seemed to have the benefit of many people's thinking and I was disappointed to see the puny outcome of the consideration by the Government of this model.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">We will have an opportunity to discuss valuation methodology later but we will take that specific issue at this point.  Deputy Bruton has raised a number of questions that I wish to reply to.  The Government accepted Professor Honohan's proposal, save in one respect.  What we did not accept is giving shares in NAMA to the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">When he engages in discussions on these matters, Professor Honohan is considerably more sophisticated than in the approach in public debate.  That must be recognised.  His proposal was, as Deputy O'Donnell says, that shareholders in the banks could be given shares in NAMA, which means that if it made a profit they would share in the upswing of NAMA.  That is not risk sharing; it is the State giving a benefit to a group of private shareholders out of legislation enacted for public purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">One way of strengthening the proposal is to give the shares to the banks.  This would create an incentive to the banks' employees, as distinct from shareholders, to work out the loans in an efficient way and to recoup some of the profit from NAMA for the bank.  I set my face against that aspect of his proposals because, with the sovereign having to intervene and take the steps we must take, if there is a profit from NAMA it should accrue to the taxpayer, not to bank shareholders or banks directly.  That was the view I took on that aspect of Professor Honohan's proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I examined the proposal with great care because anything Professor Honohan proposes must be considered.  It would have made the spectrum of risk sharing look wider because, instead of the 5% at one end, we would have 5% at the other end.  One could represent it as a 10% spectrum of risk sharing but the reality is that half of the proposal was to give an upswing to the banks or, in his proposal, their shareholders in the success of NAMA.  I did not agree with that proposal and I do not believe we should agree with it.  It was put forward in good faith and I considered it carefully but in my view if there is a profit——</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Another aspect is the question of preferential debt and this is at the heart of most of the questions asked by Deputy Bruton this morning.  The Government accepted Professor Honohan's proposal on subordinated debt and ensuring that some of the bonds issued would be subordinated debt.  However, a number of important points have been entirely overlooked in the debate about this.  The bonds issued to the banks for the banks' assets will carry 0.5% above the Euribor rate, which at present is 1.5%.  If subordinated debt is issued it must carry a much higher rate of interest, or coupon, in the order of between 5% and 7% because that is the commercial nature of the transaction.  As we all know from our extensive discussions during the year, subordinated debt is debt which is at risk.  Nobody advances a principal sum without taking a substantial coupon for the risk inherent in the advance of the sum on a subordinated basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">For the purposes of the argument, were the State to decide that half the bond issue should be in the form of subordinated debt, the consequence would follow that NAMA would be crippled with huge interest bills because the interest coupon which subordinated debt carries is way in excess of 0.5% above the Euribor rate.  By definition, because it is at risk debt it must carry a large coupon.  The subordinated debt that will issue under the 5% rubric will carry such a coupon in accordance with current market expectations.  I am not fixing the exact amount here today but it will be in the order of 5% or 7%, give or take some percentiles, because that is the nature of subordinated debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The idea that subordinated debt is somehow intrinsically superior to the type of debt that we will issue on foot of these bonds is incorrect.  In terms of the business plan and the performance of NAMA, the issue of a large quantity of subordinated debt would cripple NAMA with very extensive interest obligations in the event that the assets perform and would cause considerable difficulties for it.  That is the reason in principle that one cannot have an excessive reliance on subordinated debt.  Of course, one can have some reliance on it.  It was an extremely good idea of Professor Honohan's and I was always open to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Last March, I explored and mentioned the possibility of share warrants as an option.  In the end, we settled on subordinated debt because having issued subordinated debt NAMA can withhold payment of coupon if there is a depreciation in the asset value and can withhold the payment of the principal sum at the end of the term if there is a substantial depreciation in asset values.  Equally, were NAMA to perform, subordinated debt would carry interest at a relatively high coupon.  That is how subordinated debt works.  It provides an incentive for the banks to perform and that is a very important issue in the context of the working-out of the loans.  They have every incentive to work out the loans because by doing so they can earn more money from the coupon and ultimate principal sum that will be payable.  That is how it is being structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">There is an important technical issue, which Deputy Bruton touched on.  The general rule when valuing equity investments, for example a straight-forward ordinary share, is to value it on a mark to market basis.  It is valued as it is in the market because the share is traded in the market.  With an ordinary share, market valuation takes place on whatever it is quoted in the Stock Exchange.  However, in the case of the six-month treasury bills which are the nature of the bonds which we will issue as consideration for the assets, it is not mark to market and carries the full-face value as an asset of the bank.  In accountancy practice, if subordinated debt is well in excess of 5% of the total consideration it is mark to market and treated as an ordinary share.  Therefore, its hazardous character means it can be traded on the market and marked to a substantially reduced price.  That would mean it would not amount to compensation for the banks and one would still have to pay the additional money depending on the appropriate level of compensation for the assets that one acquires.  There are powerful technical reasons that one cannot exceed this 5% limit in the case of subordinated debt and that is the clear accountancy advice which the Government received on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I hear the Minister's plea on behalf of subordinated debt.  I am amazed that the same level of insight was not available to the Minister on the night of the guarantee.  We have never received an explanation as to who were the holders of the tier 1 dated subordinated debt that was included in the guarantee.  The Minister responded to me that with the markets it is impossible to know where, how and by whom they would be held.  I find intriguing that when it comes to this side of the argument the Minister has one take on it but when it came to the guarantee he had apparently no knowledge that this subordinated debt was the highly risky stuff that was expected to fend for itself when the risk came home.  Clearly, the Minister can have his cake and eat it when he has a NAMA cake mix, which is what we have.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">——on his take on subordinated debt and the 5%.  Let us get real.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Professor Honohan has carried out studies on bank collapses around the world on which he has published extensively.  That was one of the reasons I welcomed his appointment as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.  However, he has pointed out that one of the cornerstones to recovery is transparency.  The critical issue about transparency here is that the subordinated debt in this particular package is a fig leaf to hide the blushes of the Green Party on the renegotiation of a package and a programme for Government over which it had precious little input.  Professor Honohan spoke about transparency being the hallmark.  In effect, this proposal in regard to the subordinated debt, as the Minister suggested, must be seen in the context of the overall one.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The Minister proposes to take and value debt at way above its price, and I hope we will discuss this shortly.  A leading expert on property in Ireland over the years, Mr. Fagan, wrote a column in this morning's <i> </i>edition of<i> The Irish Times</i>.  The headline reads: “Capital values down 53% from peak”.  That refers to prime property in the Dublin area not fields around Longford which were over-zoned.  The Minister proposes to overpay for the distressed loans by a very considerable factor.  As part of the fig leaf for that overpayment, he suggests that some of the bonds would be issued in the form in which they are being issued so as to suggest a notion of risk sharing.  Risk sharing is an entirely different concept from the way he is approaching it.  The Minister’s provision of a bad bank mechanism is a bailout mechanism for the banks and the property developers who have given collateral for the loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">We want to test the quality of the bailout.  Since the Minister is the one <i>in situ</i>, he is dramatically overpaying for the value of the distressed loans.  He is doing so in the hope that it will raise bank share prices, which it is not doing at the moment because the bond markets and others who assess this, including the latest development yesterday on the SPV, see through the structure of the system.  People in the financial markets spend a few minutes looking at Ireland and at this deal and they price it based on the level of information available.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">As part of the overpayment structure, the Minister is including a percentage of this type of debt.  Yesterday, the SPV was a flip in terms of the structure he previously described for NAMA.  The 5% subordinated debt is another flip in the structure of the total which will be paid by Government, NAMA and now the SPV for the distressed assets.  The Minister is suggesting that it therefore constitutes a form of risk sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I agree with the previous speaker who said Professor Honohan's original comments on this suggested finding a mechanism for risk sharing which shifted the sharing of the risk very strongly into the court of the banks, the investors and the bond holders in order to encourage them, as far as possible, to put their own houses in order.  The structure the Minister set up is designed to rescue them, take their bad debts at an overvalued market rate, give them Government bonds and let the Irish taxpayer take the €54 billion hit allied to Irish Government debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">It is off the balance sheet as per the EU, which is fine.  I accept that is what the Minister wanted and what Opposition parties would have wanted as well.  That is a technical issue but it does not mean that the bond markets do not price that into their take on Irish Government debt and Irish banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The Minister has failed to convince me in any way that this subordinated debt provides any serious level of encouragement to the banks to work their backs off to work out these loans and get the maximum back for the Irish taxpayers who are ultimately taking the hit for the €54 billion debt being issued in their names.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">This was a political deal worked out between the Minister's party and the Green Party.  It gave the Green Party something to talk about at its conference.  I have no doubt——</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_93">I am sorry.  I should not mention party conferences.  However, the origin of this amendment is in a party conference and subsequent discussions between the Government partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The Minister has not produced one argument in defence of this particular structure because the key thing it lacks is an incentivisation.  What he needs to do is to incentivise the banks big time to clean up the mess they made.  The nurse, the fireman and the doctor who face wage cuts, along with Members of the Oireachtas, did not, as they keep saying correctly, create the risky behaviour and so on in which the banks indulged.  Instead of using a carrot and stick, the Minister's approach to the banks is all carrot and no stick.  If he was at a fence feeding a carrot to a horse, the horse would have eaten right up to his elbow by this stage because he seems to have no sense of how to address the banks and try to force them to do the work out they should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">I refer to the technical amendment the Minister has tabled.  He should not expect us to believe this is some kind of risk sharing.  Professor Honohan appeared before the committee and also wrote a number of articles in which he set out his concept of risk sharing which was drawn from his experience of crashes around the world and primarily based on incentivising the banks to work as hard as possible to clean up their balance sheets.  That is not what we are doing.  We are lifting toxic debt off their balance sheets.  In return, we are giving them Government bonds.  They can go to the ECB with the bulk of those bonds — 95% — and use them.  The Minister has still not told us if he has a gentleman's agreement with them that they will not sell them all in one fell swoop.  Some time later, as we approach the end of the ten year period, they will have their subordinated debt or perhaps by then, they will have sold it in the secondary markets.  Will there be a restriction on them doing so or are they free to do so?  Will they hold it on their balance sheets?  What does the Minister anticipate they will do with the subordinated debt?</p>
          <p eId="para_96">For instance, if a foreign bank buys a share in one of our banks — it has been mooted on several occasions that Canadian banks might take a significant interest in Allied Irish Banks or one of the other large Irish banks — what would a new owner or a significant new stakeholder do with subordinated debt on the balance sheet?  Does the Minister have a view on that?  Does he have a gentlemen's agreement with the banks about what might happen?</p>

          <p eId="para_98">The Minister has missed the point about the Honohan model.  Under the Minister's model, the taxpayer can gain only if NAMA makes a profit.  Under the Honohan model, at least there was proper risk sharing in that if NAMA made a profit the taxpayer would gain, while if the banks did well the taxpayer would gain through his or her shareholding in the banks.  Equally, under this model, if NAMA made a loss it would be shared with the shareholders and bond-holders in the banks.  Thus, proper risk sharing would have taken place.  In the Minister's proposal, there is no risk sharing with bond-holders or with the banks or their shareholders.  The taxpayer is taking on toxic assets at €7 billion above their market value and, for that, we have €2.7 billion of subordinated debt.  Can the Minister give us a valid explanation as to why he is putting the figure of 5% into the legislation?</p>

Will the ECB accept these subordinated bonds by way of security for putting money into the banks?  Can the subordinated debt be traded on the open market?  Does the Minister anticipate the subordinated debt will be repaid?  Could we have a situation in which NAMA makes a loss and the subordinated debt will have to be repaid because of the way the markets operate?  I would like the Minister to tell us this.  There may be an understanding in markets worldwide that if this subordinated debt can be traded on the open market, the Government will repay regardless of the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Minister might elaborate on the reason he is specifying 5% and on the specific details for which I asked.  He is misrepresenting the Honohan model as it was originally enunciated.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">Like my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, and most ordinary citizens, I was astounded when it was announced that the bond-holders would take only 5% of the risk in NAMA, although we had been led to believe the risk would be split 50:50 between the taxpayer and the bond-holders.  There is a big difference between 5% risk and 50% risk.  I do not think the Minister has satisfactorily answered the question of why he settled for 5%.  Why could the bond-holders not have taken 10%, 15%, 20% or even 30% of the risk so that the taxpayer would not have to take an unjust 95%?</p>

          <p eId="para_296">The principal bonds which are about to be issued will be issued at 0.5% above the Euribor rate.  Deputy Lee pointed out that the underlying securities that NAMA is acquiring will be affected.  Those interest rates will rise as well in line with the Euribor rate.  As such, the amount that can be gathered in will rise in terms of what we will, for current purposes, term the 1.5% bonds.  We are operating in a zone of substantial monetary stability with the European Central Bank.  Over time, the historical trend in interest rates has been very low by international comparisons.  I do not accept the Deputy's underlying argument that somehow future fluctuations in interest rates endanger NAMA.  If the European Central Bank rates were to rise by another 1% or 2% over the next few years, the clear implication would be that the European economy had staged a substantial recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">It is outrageous to believe that increasing interest rates would not have a bearing on the economics of NAMA.  I heard the Minister state on radio that six-month bonds would be issued.  This means they will be reissued every six months at the latest interest rate.  If interest rates increase, they affect everything in the economy.  The idea NAMA will have more income if interest rates increase misses the point because higher interest rates will strangle the property market.  The economics of this are bogus and the whole thing will unravel.  The Minister's unwillingness to raise the subordinated debt above 5% puts his finger on the issue.  His fear of high interest rates points to the fact that this is a very dodgy plan based on dubious economics and it will collapse.  The Minister is making it up as he goes along.</p>

The SPV will have its own board with members appointed by NAMA and the private sector equity investors.  All the relevant provisions refer only to the members appointed by NAMA.

As I understand it, that is a technical term of art borrowed from the bankruptcy code.  It does not mean any arrangement one may make with a creditor.  It is a technical composition or arrangement under the bankruptcy code.  I will ask the draftsmen to see whether greater precision can be put into that expression.</p>

In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, I rechecked the position with the Attorney General last night and he is quite satisfied that the Bill as it stands accommodates this investment vehicle and there is no requirement for any further amendment to the Bill to accommodate it.  The Attorney General is quite satisfied on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">On Deputy Barrett's question, the crucial point is that a shareholders agreement will be concluded in regard to this investment vehicle.

This entity, as we know from our debate to date, involves the investment of €100 million, €49 million by NAMA and €51 million by a private investor.  The figure of €51 million is less than 0.5 of 1% of the total assets with which NAMA is dealing.</p>

The first paragraph says NAMA will arrange and supervise the identification and valuation of property-backed loans on the books of qualifying financial institutions in Ireland, but will delegate the purchase and management of these loans to a separately created SPV.  A very valid question has been asked of the Minister.  I do not disagree with the Minister's legal advice that the powers the Minister has in the NAMA Bill are so wide-ranging and awesome that NAMA is absolutely entitled to be involved in the creation of vehicles and so on.

We need to have some assurance.  I refer to the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  A Report Stage amendment is needed to govern these SPVs in some shape or form, even accepting the Minister's case that they can be shoehorned to fit what is in the legislation.  The Oireachtas would want to do more than shoehorn them.  It must also be satisfied there is probity and that the actions of the SPV would be in accord with certain standards which would be broader requirements than simply relying on NAMA to interpret the purposes and apply them in some vicarious way to these other people.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">This section 30 will be very difficult.  What we seek from the members of the board of NAMA is transparency and if conflicts of interest exist, they should be clearly stated and obviously avoided.  The example that comes to mind is what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  Its relationship with other institutions such as the Dublin docklands authority, seems to have given rise to many inter-related connections, so to speak.  There is a difficulty about the Minister's proposal of an SPV.  He referred yesterday to a French precedent and to the proposal that the private investors will put up €51million.  If each of the banks was to fund a group like the Anglo ten with €5 million or €10 million each this would be permissible within the definition of an SPV.  In this situation such people would essentially act as proxies for the banks, particularly the banks involved in the guarantee.  This was the kind of arrangement made in Anglo.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Section 30 deals with the disclosure of members' interests and it deals with declarations of conflicts of interests and so on.  The members of the board will have relatively stringent requirements about declaring conflicts of interest but with regard to the members who take part as private investors or the nominees of the private investors on the SPV board, this legislation will not apply to them unless the Minister brings in a Report Stage amendment which will transfer the obligations about directors' disclosures and so on which are stated in this section, into subsidiary entities or vehicles, whichever are established by the board.  We ask for a Report Stage amendment and ask if the Minister is minded to produce such an amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">If the Attorney General has confirmed to the Minister that the Bill as it stands is sufficient to create this master SPV, then I accept this is the advice and is the view of the Attorney General.  I am puzzled as to why the Minister would resist a simple amendment that would give a manifest statutory basis for this development.  The disclosure of interests requirements for NAMA members in the Bill as it stands are very rigid and I do not take issue with them as they seem to be appropriate.  However, we do not have any such code in respect of who will be the directors of the SPV.  We know the Minister in his briefing note has posited that the members of the NAMA board, all nine of them, may be members of the SPV.  I would think this unlikely or if it happens, there will be a very large board, but this is an incidental point.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In terms of the disclosure of interests requirements the action will be at the level of the SPV; the executive operational purchase and management and disposal of assets will be done by the SPV.  In this small town I would have thought it would be very prudent to have laid out somewhere the requirements and impositions on directors.  I understand the Minister to say he will provide for all of that in the shareholder agreement and he asks us to trust him to do a good job.  That may well be the case but I am still puzzled as to why he resists incorporating in the legislation proper an open and transparent amendment, including one that would impose these same conditions on the directors of the SPV.  Is it only a power of veto that NAMA will have in terms of the directors?  I assume the owners of the private equity can nominate whomsoever they please.</p>

However, if they put up  €51 million they are free to nominate whomsoever they please.  The Minister is saying NAMA could veto Mr. X because his track record has either been somewhat deficient, because he may have a conflict of interest or might be perceived as an unsuitable person.  Is the only assurance for the House that the Minister will be prescriptive about the matter in the shareholder agreement?  What assurance do we have that there will not be people guiding the private vehicle in a manner that might give rise to a conflict of interest?</p>

          <p eId="para_487">The matter of disclosure of interest is very relevant for the membership of the board of the SPV.  I am seriously concerned that not only the master SPV but the sub SPVs associated with AIB or Bank of Ireland could have nominee directors directly involved with the very same banking institutions.  Not only will the banks receive the €54 billion but they will continue to have control over the acquisition, management and disposal of the assets.  It is difficult to comprehend why no primary legislation is required for the establishment of the SPV.  I expect the Minister will bring such a measure through on Report Stage following due consideration.  If the Minister is relying on the existing body of legislation his powers are far too wide to be able to establish an SPV.  Given the level of taxpayers' money involved and the implications of NAMA, SPVs should warrant specific reference in primary legislation.  The Minister keeps directing us to section 12(2)(<i>r</i>) which refers to borrow, lend, or transfer debt securities, including equity and debt instruments.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">The description of section 30 refers to disclosure of interests.  I am simply thinking out loud but should this not refer to disclosure of interests in the case of an alleged conflict?  There does not appear to be reference, in section 30 or anywhere else in the Bill, to a requirement for board members of NAMA to declare their interests.  Everyone in the House has a statutory obligation to declare all interests above a certain level.  It seems the people who would control €74 billion of Irish liability should have an obligation to disclose all their interests, preferably in public.  However, if there was a reason it could not be in public, they should do so at a register available to the chairman and chief executive of NAMA.  There should be an absolute obligation included in the legislation such that in the same way as Members of the Oireachtas must declare their assets and interests so should any board members.  This would assist with transparency and it would increase public faith in the operations of the board of NAMA.  I call on the Minister to consider such an amendment on Report Stage.</p>

What relationship will the evaluation panel as envisaged in the Bill have to the board structures?  In particular, as members now have the statement on the SPV, what relationship will these board sub-committees have to the SPV?  The Minister will be able to appoint persons to the sub-committees, presumably at his will or perhaps on the nomination of the chief executive or the board.

          <p eId="para_539">No.  The board will be obliged to bear ultimate responsibility for the application of the evaluation methodology set out in the Act and this responsibility must rest with the board.  There is no question, for example, of section 32 being used to establish a valuation committee, if this is what the Deputy was thinking.  That does not arise because a sub-committee of such fundamental importance would have to be set out in the subsection itself with the audit, risk and credit sub-committees.  Under the valuation methodology provisions, any functions that rest with the agency rest with the board subject to delegation to properly retained officers who have expertise in the particular areas.  There is no question of a sub-committee being established to deal with valuation.</p>

I have ruled this out and have stated it is clear that this is not the intention of the Bill.  Valuation is so fundamental to this Bill that were there a sub-committee to deal with valuation, it would have to be expressly mentioned in the Bill.  However, this is not the case and the intention is that the board will exercise collectively functions in respect of valuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">At this point I have not prescribed within the legislation for the precise corporate structure that applies beyond that.  In other words, I do not prescribe who does the valuations, what expert officer reports valuation to the board, how the board considers the question of valuations or how the board looks collectively at valuations.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">I wish to make a small point in respect of the balance of sections 32(1)(<i>a</i>) and section 32(1)(<i>b</i>).  The former explicitly refers to advisory committees while the latter refers to “such other committees and sub-committees as it considers necessary or expedient”.  This is a rather bald and unconditional statement of capacity by the board itself and I seek clarification in this regard.  The Minister has stated that where a sub-committee has been established by the board to handle a matter in respect of valuation, there would never be a question of such a sub-committee functioning in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I have not difficulty in understanding the point about the function of valuation.  Section 32(1)(<i>b</i>) unconditionally states: “such other committees and sub-committees as it considers necessary or expedient”.  It is a power given to the board.  What the Minister is offering is a ministerial interpretation of how the board will restrain itself.  That it is not how it reads.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_554">Deputy Burton rightly asked about valuation in general.  The board cannot delegate that function to the committee under the terms of the legislation because it is such a fundamental feature of the legislation that, if the Legislature were to have intended the board to do that, it would have to provide for such a committee in express terms.  The next subsection refers to the formation of advisory committees and such other sub-committees as the board may deem expedient.  Let us suppose there is a difficulty with a particular valuer, who was engaging in persistent misconduct, and the board found it necessary to engage in an inquiry in that regard.  It would be open to the board to appoint a sub-committee to investigate the charges of misconduct in respect of the valuer, to follow the appropriate procedures as advised and to report to the board on what action should be taken.  That is how I envisage the corporate governance structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I have received representations on the establishment of committees and I will convey my views to the board on that.  I wish to speak to the section on this aspect although I do not intend to make legislative provision for the contingencies about which I have entertained representations.  These were made by the First Minister of Northern Ireland, who is concerned about the volume of assets NAMA will have in Northern Ireland.  He indicated his wish to see a Northern Ireland advisory committee established to advise on the operation of NAMA in Northern Ireland.  This could be slotted into the framework of section 32.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Arising from Government discussions it is clear that NAMA has major implications for planning and development, as Deputy Burton pointed out earlier.  There is no question of NAMA becoming a planning authority or usurping the functions of the planning authorities but, in respect of the matters in which NAMA has a function in development, it is important that it has a cohesive view on planning and development and it may require a planning and development committee.  I do not intend to write that into legislation but I should disclose it to the House because it is something I will advise the board on.  If it had a fundamental objection to this it would voice it to me and I would have to trust the judgment of the board members when they are appointed.  They seem reasonable examples of additional committees that could be established.</p>

Now that the proposal in this section transfers entitlement to establish any advisory committee to the board, so that the Minister has no further say in the matter, it may well be that the board will decide to take on board the representations made by the First Minister of Northern Ireland and establish an advisory board with the function to protect the interests of property portfolios containing properties in Northern Ireland.</p>

Mr. Kelly observed silence but I was struck by the warm and enthusiastic support for NAMA from both the SDLP and the Official Unionist Party.

          <p eId="para_599">I understand that it is the normal standard that applies where a company agrees to indemnify an employee.  The employees of a company must have some measure of protection against personal liability through the board and good faith is the standard used.  The amendment suggests that "shall" should be deleted and substituted with the word "may".  That would remove entirely the scope of the indemnity.  The phrase "without negligence" could also be inserted but that could be very broad.  The classic example of negligence is the person emptying an oil tanker who has a smoke and throws the butt away and then there is a conflagration.  That is negligence but it is still attributed to the employer.</p>

The proposed amendment is for the agency to prepare a code of conduct relating to how it takes account of the commercial interests of credit institutions that are not participating institutions.

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I am interested to know what the Minister envisages as a code of conduct for non-participating banks?  We have seen in the courts a move by some non-participating banks to appoint receivers and liquidators.  People could be forgiven for thinking that there may have been an element of ransom in such approaches as if one held a small but strategic element of a site, development or project one could seek to exact a higher price than that to which one was entitled because NAMA would be coming along to purchase assets at a price considerably above their market value, even though the courts valued those assets at 25% of their value, which was a 75% mark down.  The issue remains of some concern in the context of NAMA as those who might have small interests in projects could demand more than a fair recompense because NAMA might have a certain view of how a project should be dealt with and they would be in a position to try to hold NAMA over a barrel.  What codes of conduct are envisaged?  I am sure the Minister has given some thought to it if he is tabling an amendment seeking to have these codes of conduct installed.  Perhaps he will give us the benefit of his thinking on them so we can consider the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">As I am on my feet I will ask about another issue which perhaps needs a code of conduct.  Bringing in good assets will bring in people who have projects that they hope to fulfil and bring to fruition.  However, NAMA is not a bank with a lending capability and these people will not be able go to normal banks because the security of their projects will probably be compromised by NAMA's ownership.  What will be the code of conduct on lending?  Some people will have a legitimate expectation of getting banking services on normal terms but NAMA might have a different view on how it wants to deal with its rationed resources.  Will codes of conduct be developed in this sphere?  Do we need to make legislative provision for what is proposed generally on codes of conduct?</p>

          <p eId="para_611">I wish to intervene to assist the debate.  There is no need to make legislative provision of the type Deputy Bruton envisaged but the issue he raised in the conclusion of his contribution is very important.  It is intended to draw up a code of conduct dealing with that issue and there is ample power in the legislation to do so.  As the Deputy rightly said, if one has a performing loan in NAMA, that might not necessarily be NAMA's first priority in terms of advancing credit.  NAMA's priority will be to sell at the maximum value for the taxpayer in regard to any development.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">In regard to the earlier question about the express reference to the issue of the non-participating institutions, strong representations were made to us on behalf of these institutions to the effect that they would be prejudiced by the sheer size and scale of NAMA and that NAMA should not be in a position where it can lever an undue advantage out of its position as against the other participating banks.  That is the circumstance being addressed in this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I note that NAMA will prepare codes of practice within three months of its establishment day.   Does the Minister anticipate these codes of practice will be in place before the first transfer of assets in December?  It is extremely important that the codes of practice are in place before the transfer of €16 billion worth of assets.  By January 2010, the Minister will have transferred €40 billion worth of assets which makes up a significant proportion of the €77 billion.  The codes of practice should be in place before any transfer of assets to NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I wish to touch on a point Deputy Bruton made in regard to performing loans going into NAMA.  Yesterday the Minister said NAMA is there to get the maximum return for the taxpayer.  I refer to the bulk of the securities in terms of an asset being transferred to NAMA and to getting value for it if it is a greenfield site.  There is a limit of €5 billion in terms of the amount NAMA can extend.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that.  For what does he see that €5 billion being used?  How will NAMA ensure that these loans continue to be performing loans and that value is got for the site?  It is a critical issue in terms of return.  The Minister might address that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">Can we get an undertaking from the Minister that all the codes of conduct will be published in full because they are extremely significant in terms of how NAMA will operate?  The draft NAMA business plan for the period November-December 2009 states that contractual agreements will be agreed and that firms will be appointed formally for positions, including legal services, property valuation services, loan and associated valuation services, etc.  It also states that the ten to 15 largest borrower exposures will be dealt with by year end and that NAMA will meet the major borrowers as their loans transfer to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">That means the die will be cast on how this will operate because if the board of NAMA operates in a particular way for the ten to 15 biggest borrower exposures — the €16 billion or so — and if, by the end of February, it has dealt with up to €38 billion, unless the codes of practice are published and made available before that process starts, it will be open to an aggrieved person to state that by being dealt with later, he or she is being dealt with in a less fair way.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Surely, the Minister must publish the codes of practice as NAMA begins its operation.  The Bill states that it must do so within three months of the establishment day.  Section 34(4) states that if that has not been done, the Minister can establish his own codes of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The National Treasury Management Agency has codes of practice.  However, there are examples of senior banking staff who are compromised in regard to loans they have taken out with the banks.  I know informally how they will be dealt with, namely, that they are not to be involved in any of this.  Surely those codes of practice should be clearly stated in writing on the establishment day.  Does the Minister have a position on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I believe the Minister said the UK Treasury and the non-participating institutions are concerned that they will be dealt with fairly in regard to the codes of conduct.  I believe he has committed that NAMA will not act to the "detriment" — I think that was the word he used — of other parties.  Surely all of this means he is obliged to publish the codes of practice.  If they are ready to be published, can we see them?  Can they be laid before the House?  It would also help to clarify in the public mind how NAMA will deal with experts, such as valuers, estate agents and so on in towns and village around Ireland, who will have an interest in the progress of this.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">These institutions include Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank and ACC.  Before I came into this meeting, I had representations from small businesses, specifically pig farmers, who are being put under tremendous pressure by these institutions.  Some of them may want to leave the country, so it is important they get some crumb of comfort in whatever way they can.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation at the end of this NAMA process where there are only two banks left.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank, in particular, have given good service to the Border region.  If one looks at a map, one will see they are situated in the main in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, although they have branches throughout the country.  How their interests are addressed is extremely important and it will be vital to what happens to the smaller industries in my region because if they are put under pressure, it will affect the valuations of NAMA.  Only last week, I saw a 2,400 sq. ft. house for sale at €165,000, the price of the site two years ago.  That is as a result of pressure from some of the lending institutions.  We need to be very careful about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Deputy Burton spoke about the ten biggest operators but we must remember that there is no sign of any finance going to small businesses to allow them to stay in business.  If we do not keep people working and paying taxes, it will be very hard to pay for NAMA.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">Deputy Crawford has raised an important issue.  Some people are caught in a twilight zone in that they bank with Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank, in particular, which are not open for business.  I know of one situation in which a call from a farmer who did not have enough money to feed his cattle was not returned for four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The reason I bring this up is that the farmer did go through one of the major banks associated with NAMA, where the bank officials sympathised with him but refused to deal with him or any client from Ulster Bank or National Irish Bank.  This is the issue I raised yesterday.  These banks are closed for business.  It is a serious issue and I hope this legislation will deal with it.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_547" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_632">Deputy Feighan has identified one of the crucial facets of the banking crisis, which is not often discussed in this House because of the anxiety to attribute blame — which can legitimately be attributed to many.  The Irish banking sector divides into domestically and externally owned banks.  Some, although not all, of the externally owned institutions are clearly deleveraging, which of itself creates a major credit gap in the Irish system.  I do not want to go back to the Second Stage debate, but that is one of the reasons we must have a solution.  We must put some of the banks in a position to bridge the gap in the credit supply.  I do not want to decode all the statements that different bankers have made.  I have heard many bankers say it is business as usual.  It cannot be business as usual in the banking system if it has gone through such a cash shortage as it has since the earlier part of this year.  That is why it is essential to have a structural solution, although we can argue about the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Deputy Burton mentioned codes of practice.  We must remember that the codes of practice regulate how assets are managed by NAMA.  We are not dealing with the valuation process.  Three months is a reasonable deadline for the board and there is power for the Minister to intervene at the end of that period.  The board must be selected and appointed and then come to grips with its enormous corporate responsibilities and draw up its code of practice, and I do not think a time limit of three months is unreasonable when one considers the time limits for the acquisition of the assets, which are of a similar scale.  I appreciate that in the business plan the ambition is to start a sizeable amount of the work by Christmas, which is now less than two months away, but that time limit could easily slip into January at the rate we have been proceeding.</p>

          <p eId="para_640">May I explain this to the Minister?  If one works in the media one has a style book, and in a large company or bank one has the company operating manual.  If one is an officer of a company, one has reference to a manual which can also be described as a code of practice.  NAMA needs something like this, at least in draft form.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Let us say half of the ten or 15 top developers disagree vehemently with the manner in which NAMA approaches the management of their work-out.  They are opinionated people and they think the people in NAMA know nothing and are not dealing with them properly.  There is a reference in the business plan to codes of practice or an operating manual or whatever the Minister wants to call it.  The diagram at the end envisages quite a structured process and he offered us a process auditor.  He has not started to work on NAMA just now but has been working on it for seven or eight months.  I do not understand why he feels it is adequate for a firm operating manual to become available only three months after establishment.  Let us remember that many professionals who deal directly with clients have a manual that guides them on the various regulations for dealing with them, and must go through a step-by-step procedure in order to protect themselves and, more particularly, to work impartially and fairly with their clients.</p>

I undertook informally to consult the Opposition on an appointment but I am anxious that such agreement will only apply in the case of the first chief executive because any subsequent appointment should be made by the board.  It clearly would be desirable to have the first appointment made by the board but I do not want to delay the commencement of the agency.  My intention is to table an amendment to section 35 to require that subsequent appointments are made by the board.</p>

We cannot know his salary, whether he will get a bonus or the rules under which he will operate.  We have to move so fast on the issue, after eight months on this road, that we will know nothing about this man other than his name and the job he is to perform.  Are these not the reasons we are here in the first place?  We should be operating under new rules and transparency, openness and accountability should be the order of the day.  Who is the man?

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_743">One of the problems at the root of the banking system has been the system of bonuses which was related to short-term thinking about how to deal with risk.  The same exposures arise with regard to a bonus package that may be arranged behind closed doors for a chief executive of an agency such as NAMA.  It could, for example, emphasise short-term gain rather than the long-term work-out of the assets held by the agency.  While NAMA may be a different type of operation from a bank in that it will be engaged in asset recovery rather than risk, rather than lending, the very same principles apply.  We need to have confidence that a remuneration committee will set the figure and pursue policies based on learning lessons from recent problems in the banking sector.  There must be some level of public scrutiny in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The notion that issues will continue to be kept secret is not in accord with what several Deputies have said.  Recent problems have been closely related to a remuneration and bonus system that encouraged incorrect thinking about issues.  Nothing requires long-term thinking more than the management of €54 billion of taxpayers' money in an asset recovery vehicle, about which there has been significant concern.  The International Monetary Fund has written about the hazards of publicly managed asset recovery vehicles not securing best value.  It is important, therefore, that the bonuses and incentives are properly set and open to scrutiny and are applied in a manner which maximises the interests of taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The issue is not only the level of pay the person who will be appointed will receive or whether he or she will be awarded bonuses.  I will not mind if a bonus is paid provided the appointee delivers the beef for the taxpayer.  The issue should, however, be subject to public scrutiny.  If the appointee is given a bonus, we should know the reason it was awarded and we must be assured that it was genuinely earned and based on a long-term perspective, rather than the short-term generation of cash flow to make a particular year look good.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">No one present would begrudge anyone fair pay, bonuses that are merited or other extras provided for doing a good job.  However, members of the public do not understand the reason the pay and remuneration of employees of the National Treasury Management Agency are not available for public scrutiny.  It is a disgrace that this information is not available.  It appears that in employing someone to try to get us out of the awful hole in which we find ourselves, we are reverting to the process that got us into the hole in the first place.  Does the Minister not see the contradiction in what is being done?  Does he not see that members of the public will no longer stand for packages and bonuses being awarded without information being provided on whether they are merited, warranted or deserved?</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Surely we need a fresh start and a different approach.  The Minister should be open to accepting an amendment that will ensure we know exactly what the appointee will receive and the reason he or she will receive it.  If the appointee does his or her job properly, he or she will do the State a great service.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I hope the contract which will be drawn up for this person will not lead us into a position where, if it does not work out because the person does not do his or her job properly and is not up to the job, he or she will not get a golden parachute like we have seen in the past, which will infuriate people more.  If a person cannot do the job he or she should be out the door and not rewarded for not doing the job properly.  While the person is in the job the public should know how much the taxpayer is paying him or her.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">I thank the Chair for the opportunity to say a few brief words on this.  The Minster's logic appears to be that because it is happening under the NTMA and the soon-to-be-appointed chief executive officer will be an employee of it and for that reason the same culture of secrecy regarding salary remuneration should apply.  There is now an opportunity for a fresh start.  We are talking here about taxpayers' money.  It will be regrettable, given the fact that this institution will be dealing with €50 billion, €60 billion or €70 billion of taxpayers' money, that the headlines will be about the expenditure on the salary of one individual.  In terms of the vitally important aspect of public support for the principle of NAMA, one reason the Minister is losing that support is that people feel the same old show is in town.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">This is an opportunity to shine some light where it has not shone before in respect of what is happening with public funds and remuneration for public officials.  The NTMA is not a bank and NAMA is not a bank, but public money is involved.  Therefore, the principles of openness and public access to information should prevail.  The headlines will be about the Minister's refusal to have openness about the salary aspect, but it is only part of the requirement for transparency in its operations, which should be central to the operation of NAMA in the future.  Simply because the chief executive is an employee of the NTMA is not a reason for cloaking the salary and remuneration package in secrecy and the Minister should use this opportunity to break new ground in that respect.  It begs the question — perhaps not for this occasion — as to why the veil of secrecy should apply to NAMA or the NTMA.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">The chief executive officer is not a civil servant.  If we want to have this debate, let us have it about the NTMA.

          <p eId="para_776">I understand the Minister now has in his possession the findings of the review of the remuneration of the top people in the public service — I do not know if he has had it for a few days or weeks.  My recollection is that the Minister drew our attention specifically to the fact that many top persons are paid a package of compensation in excess of his own.  I accept that because, if I recall correctly, the chief executive of the ESB earns more than €400,000, as does the chief executive of RTE.  Am I to assume that because this post will be filled by a top person it will be in the upper regions of a top person's pay?  In other words, it is likely to be over €400,000 and possibly over €500,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">There is a public interest element to this issue.  The Minister is working on the L'Oréal principle that he is paying this amount because the man — we think it is a man — concerned is worth it.  If this man is worth it——</p>

          <p eId="para_790">The Taoiseach told us 18 months ago that he was going to bring the primacy of politics back to the Chamber.  That did not happen.  If anything, it is worse.  In fairness to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, gave the committee the opportunity to make recommendations to him on appointments to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Deputy O'Donnell made a suggestion about a Dáil committee.  The Committee on Finance and the Public Service did not have the opportunity to examine the Minister's appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">It is important because every person in this Chamber wants the very best and brightest person to be the CEO of NAMA given that the person concerned will have an enormous job to do in the public interest.  It is important that the members of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service are given the opportunity to run the rule over whomever this person is because he or she is likely to be the person — contrary to the Minister's opinion on NAMA making a profit — who, if it makes a loss, will be placing a levy on the banks.  We all know the pressures the banks will bring to bear if a levy is imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">A levy should not be collected in ten or five years' time.  Instead, there should be a buy-back clause in place of a levy for the most distressed assets, that is, the grassy fields around every town in every county in the country.  A levy will not work.  The Minister should scrap the levy and consider a buy-back clause whereby, if the banks scald us now via NAMA with the transfer of loans——</p>

          <p eId="para_807">I would like the Minister to go back to the points referred to in his replies.  We all realise that a serious position prevails currently and we all realise the importance of a structure like NAMA and the responsibility that it proposes to take on.  We also realise that it takes on great responsibility devolved to it from the Government and which the Government may have had to take upon itself otherwise.  We realise that the chief executive and members must be remunerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Does the Minister agree that in these very straitened times, the general public is not as tolerant of what it sees as a further escape from the normal rigours of the restrictions which everyone must endure in the present climate?  When the public sees something that appears at variance with its own position such as a bonus or extraordinary payment, people will raise questions given that they have increased burdens.  Does the Minister accept that they have a valid case, as that is fundamental to the current discussion?</p>
          <p eId="para_809">If the Minister does not agree that the public has a valid concern, this part of the debate is of no value whatever.  If the Minister is in agreement, it falls naturally that he must determine what is reasonable.  I recognise that one cannot govern by public acclamation; it is important for the time in which we live that we realise that governing in such a way does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Will the Minister clarify if a balance must be struck?  Along with the burdens of the mortgages and taxation which the taxpayers must bear, they will also have to worry about the burden of NAMA.  It is a bridge over troubled waters or, conversely, a leaky aqueduct over their heads.  It is not funny and is a serious issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">The opportunities for the indignation decibels to rise in respect of this legislation are not always directly related to the importance of the issues under consideration.  For those of us who remember the legislation which established the National Treasury Management Agency, one of the reasons for so doing was to take it from under the remit of Civil Service pay rates at the time.  In so far as one is competent to judge it — with the little knowledge I have picked up over the years I am not — I believe the NTMA has done a particularly good job.  I did not hear anybody on any side of the House denigrate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">My point is very similar.  In the handout given by the Minister, he indicated that one of the benefits of the master SPV structure is that it will permit the full recoupment by the NTMA of any staff or other costs incurred throughout the life of NAMA.  Without the SPV structure, these costs would be charged and become expenses of the Central Fund like the NTMA's current administrative costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Deputy Rabbitte made reference to the fact that the CEO of NAMA could also be the CEO of the master SPV.  Does such a person necessarily need to be a member of staff in the NTMA?  Could such a person stand alone, which would allow the Minister to disclose the terms of remuneration, including bonuses, and bring about proper transparency?  That leads from Deputy Rabbitte's point.</p>

I am one of the people totally opposed to the course of action being taken by the Government but most people are reassured that the NTMA would have such a central role.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">It should be remembered that at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts earlier this year, the NTMA was severely criticised for losses in the national portfolio pension fund <i>vis-à-vis</i> the performance of other sovereign funds.

          <p eId="para_844">Yes.  That is the reason the agency is being set up under the aegis of the NTMA.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the history of this matter and I am simply conforming with precedent in this regard.  I have listened to what was said in the House and I will reflect on it.  It is a position of considerable public importance but no person associated with the NTMA has been called into question in the past because of the performance of duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">As Deputy Durkan reminded us some time ago, this question of bonuses is of great importance.  I do not know if the chief executive will be paid a bonus or salary and it is clearly a matter for the board.  Bonuses are undesirable in the current climate and I would have thought they would have to be very carefully structured if they are to be paid.  I cannot predetermine the matter.</p>

I have a protocol with me agreed by the Treasury across the water where, in a body like NAMA, someone was designated the Accounting Officer.  When I need the protocol, I cannot lay my hand on it.  In the arrangement across the water, the person in question would be the Accounting Officer and be responsible and directly answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I remind the Minister that it is not just in Her Majesty's realm that these arrangements apply.  They also apply here.  For example, we recently made the Garda Commissioner the Garda's Accounting Officer.

          <p eId="para_855">Given the functions of this chief executive and the sensible indication by the Minister that he or she will be the CEO of the special purpose vehicle, why should he or she not be called the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Act and the normal relationship with the Committee of Public Accounts?</p>

          <p eId="para_858">I can try to conduct research to shed further light on the matter for Report Stage.  For example, the NTMA is charged on the Central Fund as an incidental to the funding of the national debt.  Therefore, the person responsible is an accountable person rather than an Accounting Officer.  The Garda Commissioner has a Vote from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by way of delegation from the Minister, so he is an Accounting Officer in respect of the Garda Síochána Vote or that part of it committed to him.</p>

It seems that the chief executive officer might also be the CEO of the SPV.  I am at a loss to understand why the relationship between the CEO and the SPV is not being spelled out.  Since the SPV will be controlled by private interests, what if they want to appoint their own person as the designated executive?  They will control a majority of the shares.

Were this the case, it would have real powers of its own.  If it is simply an arrangement of convenience, surely the Minister ought to refer to the relationship between the chief executive and special entities, companies, SPVs and so on.  He would be wise to do so.  We all know that marriages are made in heaven and divorces are made in detail.  If there were to be a row, God forbid, between the investors in the special purpose vehicle and the State, where would the Minister's protection or that of the chief executive officer of NAMA, lie?  I do not mean they could decide to ignore the chief executive officer but they could decide that their position as the majority shareholders in the special purpose vehicle would give them an entitlement to nominate their person, their executive, additional persons, equal persons, equal executives, to the Minister's chief executive of NAMA.</p>

Will there be one CEO for NAMA and the master SPV and separate CEOs for the sub-SPVs if they go ahead?  Will the Minister say if the sub-SPVs are going ahead?

I understand there are legitimate questions to be asked about it.  We can continue the debate but it has all the unreality of the debate Deputy O'Donnell's party conducted about external association for about 20 years and reference to dictionaries.  This is the Bill that will regulate NAMA.  Under this legislation NAMA has power to set up this investment vehicle and can enter a suitable arrangement to entirely protect the statutory purposes of NAMA.  That is what this is about.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">Why was it decided to structure NAMA in this way whereby the NTMA would provide the services to NAMA rather than the traditional direct relationship?  It seems a cumbersome arrangement.  There are some skills in the NTMA on which the Minister has relied in advising him of the development of NAMA, although at one stage it seemed that the chief executive officer was outside the loop in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Notwithstanding that, it seems there is an indirect arrangement under which the NTMA assigns staff, rather than NAMA doing so directly.  Having chosen this rather unusual approach the Minister then suggested the special purpose vehicle would get him out of the unusual approach set up in the first place, such that there would not be a charge on the central fund although NTMA activities otherwise become a charge on the central fund.  I am keen to know the reasoning behind this relationship.  Earlier sections have obscured the terms and conditions of the chief executive officer.  When establishing a body such as NAMA, it would seem more straightforward to establish the controls fairly clearly with the various checks and balances appropriate for that body, rather than cycling them through NTMA.  I wish to hear a little more about the thinking behind this.</p>

There is no question mark about the legal merits of the amendment and this is provided for in the Bill.  The wider question the Deputy wishes to explore is the relationship between the NTMA and the National Assets Management Agency.  The Government has been clear in its intent that the agency should be set up under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency.  First, this is important because several personnel from the NTMA have already worked on the project.  Second, it is important because it allows the agency to benefit from the substantial international reputation of NTMA.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy Rabbitte and other Deputies disavow any intention to impugn the capacities of the NTMA in this debate.  For this reason the Bill provides clear roles for the NTMA on the board of the agency and in the provision of staff and other resources to the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">I refer to the requirements under section 40(2), including the necessity for good character, not previously disqualified, and especially having no material conflict, whether actual or potential.  I strongly support this provision.  I recognise that the chief executive of the NTMA and the acting director of NAMA have indicated this would be a requirement.  This is a proper requirement and a very good section which sets a floor.  The recruitment of people to NAMA involves a situation of great conflict, difference of opinion and difference of approach to valuation.  We need persons whose probity is proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  This must be a hallmark of any recruitment into this body.  I welcome the section and I strongly welcome the position taken by the chief executive officer of the NTMA.  It is somewhat unusual in the history of the Irish public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Section 40(3) states, "Before the NTMA assigns a member of its staff to NAMA under <i>subsection (1)</i>, the NTMA shall ensure that he or she provides a statement of his or her interests, assets and liabilities to the Chief Executive Officer of NAMA and the Chief Executive of the NTMA in a form that the NTMA specifies.”  Perhaps all the people transferred in an acting capacity to NAMA, including senior people, have done this already or have been requested to do so by the chief executive officer of the NTMA.  I believe it is a very good measure because there is a great concern about the operation of NAMA.  I have raised this matter with the Minister previously.  Persons may be compromised, especially in banks which are part of the NAMA process, by a very high level of personal lending, over and above the value of the family house.  Several persons associated with Anglo Irish Bank have significantly large lendings and loans from that bank and are seriously compromised.  This requirement should apply to members of the board as well.  I do not intend to demean the qualifications of persons putting themselves forward to be members of the board.  The vast majority of such persons will meet all the characteristics set out in the Bill.  This is a new standard for a public appointments process.  I understand the chairman of the NTMA and the managing director designate of NAMA were heavily involved in drawing up this code, which is to be commended.  People may have observations related to how appropriate it is but I believe the section is a very good addition to the Bill and I welcome it.</p>

There certainly is a view that the cost of debt is about keeping down the charges while asset recovery might have a different set of priorities.  Asset recovery has a different function and tying it in so closely raises doubts because the NTMA does not have the same purpose  While I have not thought through the potential conflicts, they certainly are different.  I refer to the function of raising money as opposed to that of recovering assets.  I ask the Minister to assure members that they will operate at arm's length.

          <p eId="para_931">This issue relates to the conflicts of interest of those who will provide professional advice.  It seems there is a small circle of those who advise on legal and financial issues.  One frequently sees the same companies cropping up on both sides of the argument and which provide advice simultaneously to both the Government and the banks.  While one is led to believe that Chinese walls exist within such companies that assure adequate protection, why would one choose such large companies if one believed they were made up of Chinese walls and that a company's expertise and assembled experience were not completely available to those who engaged it?  I believe an issue of potential conflicts arises in this regard when the State engages legal and other advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Something like a cooling-off period is needed.  There must be a way to assure people that there is not such almost free movement.  I refer to a scenario in which one could move from advising the State, having gained access to its information, to suddenly providing advice to someone who is on the other side of the counter, that is, acting as poacher as opposed to gamekeeper.  I am unsure whether I have an answer to this problem.  I have tabled an amendment to try to offer a cooling-off period as a way to manage conflicts of interest or to emphasise their importance.  However, this is an issue about which there will be some concern because of the small number of people who turn up repeatedly on all sides of the argument.  I seek the Minister's views on how one can best be assured that the State's advice is independent and of the best quality and that such advice is not being availed of by others who employ the same companies.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_933">The difficulty with this section is the issue of insider knowledge, insider trading and insider advantage because someone is working on a NAMA project.  The major accounting and legal firms in this State that consistently appear as providers of such services to organisations such as NAMA number less than ten in either case or perhaps even less than five.  NAMA will be all about information regarding the management of the loans, land portfolios and so on.  For example, investors who acquire information about the likely approaches to the pricing of underlying assets and so on will have highly valuable insider information.  Normally, certainly in the United States, there are severe restrictions on the use of insider information.  While I must ask the Minister how this would be done, section 43 contains a worthwhile exhortation to behave appropriately and properly.  Do penalties exist and is it a criminal offence to use insider information in a way that is inappropriate?</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Two considerations arise in respect of insider information.  The first consideration is that the State itself would be cheated regarding the carrying out of the work.  The second pertains to competition and the free market in that persons interested in acquiring assets would be advantaged to the disadvantage of other business people in a small town, area or village in which NAMA land was available.  While one cannot legislate for everything, has the Minister thought about how these fundamentally ethical issues will be addressed?  The Fine Gael amendment attempts to put some distance between the service providers and NAMA after they have left its service.  Has the Minister a more general or robust approach in mind?  The experience of several tribunals has done great damage to the notion of public ethical values in this country and has cost a lot of money.</p>

At one point I suggested to him that because so much money was involved, the chairman of NAMA ought to be someone like a retired High Court judge in order that probity, as well as an economic approach, etc., would be a hallmark.

From the Minister's answers yesterday, some €100 million to €140 million per year will be provided in fees to various service providers.  It is a vast amount of money in a depressed market.  If someone has inside information that can be used, it is an even greater amount of money.  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Earlier, I praised the requirements in section 40.  Could these requirements apply to service providers?  The way Chinese walls operate in a big partnership is that some partners will do the NAMA work and not communicate with other partners about it, but Ireland is such a small country that we must strive for a situation where NAMA is robustly fair in its business dealings and not influenced by special positions.  This is not an easy thing to do because we also want it to be economic and to proceed if it is the Government's chosen vehicle, although the Labour Party does not agree with it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_942">I have two concerns — the use of consultants and who are the consultants.  The use of consultants is prevalent as one can see from the example of local authorities installing a pedestrian crossing or moving a speed limit by 100 m.  The engineering section used to prepare the scheme but that no longer happens and it is now put out to consultants.  Local authorities are one example I have cited but this also applies to the HSE, Departments and the NTMA.  Why has expertise not been built up in the Department over the years when there was affluence and opportunity to bring it in?</p>
          <p eId="para_943">We hear about the Chinese walls but in the real world people have suspicions and concerns.  It always seems to be the same group that is employed and takes millions of taxpayers' money for its work.  It causes great suspicion.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Some 90% of liquidations and receiverships seem to be handed to one group of accountants in the city.  They are known as the big ten.  I am advised by auditors outside the city that their prices are some 50% to 60% cheaper than the rate in the city but these people on the outer reaches are not being engaged.  There is an issue of efficiency in this respect.  Perhaps it is not the Minister's portfolio but it is a major issue.  People in the provinces, as they are called by some individuals, are just as competent and able and, more importantly, are much hungrier for the work than some of the city operators.</p>

          <p eId="para_945">The fears being raised are real.  This is a real minefield and I am not sure what are the solutions.  I am not sure the Fine Gael amendment meets this problem.  It is an attempt to deal with one aspect of this, where someone has had a hand on the levers of knowledge and then leaves a company.  The Fine Gael amendment provides for a period thereafter in which a person cannot use the knowledge to the advantage of new clients.  That is a real problem.  I am sceptical in any event about the effectiveness of Chinese walls in this town.  Everything I have learned, from the beef tribunal to the present time, confirms my scepticism.  The Minister has gone to extraordinary lengths, more than in any legislation I can recall, to deal with this question of standards in respect of other issues that have arisen, some of which we have discussed today.  This is where a lot of the action resides.  At a time when many solicitors and other professionals are out of work, the small number of big companies will regard NAMA as a cash cow.  By God, what a cash cow it will be for them for a long time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">It is about the knowledge and information that these companies have.  It is very difficult to guard against the conflict of interest issue raised in this amendment.  Some projects will be intended to be completed, an assessment will be made and the view will be taken that it is better to finish the project or that the development land should be developed as quickly as possible while other land returns to agricultural use.  This information is in the possession of the advisers.  Fine Gael attempts to provide for a cooling off period and this is fine, but not a great deal will happen all that quickly.  It will not happen within three months.  At the same time, one cannot unreasonably trammel someone from doing other work.  I do not suggest I have the solution but the potential in this area ranges from conflict of interest to straightforward corruption.  I know companies in this town and if one were to believe all one is told about the Chinese walls, one would think we were on a different continent.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">It is critical that the public has confidence in the process of NAMA.  What we propose is common practice in business whereby people who are taken on in particular roles normally have to sign a contract to the effect that they will not engage in activities for a period of time after leaving the post.  It is perfectly reasonable that people involved in contracts with NAMA would allow for a three-month period after the contract is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Does the €240 million per annum being incurred by NAMA include the costs incurred by the National Treasury Management Agency for the work it is doing for NAMA?  That is not quite clear.  Reference is made to administrative costs with outsourcing of services, fees paid to banks on a cost recovery basis and fees paid to a master servicer acting on behalf of NAMA.  Will the Minister clarify this point?  How much will be incurred on an annual basis by the National Treasury Management Agency in dealing with its work on behalf of NAMA?</p>
          <p eId="para_955">Is the Minister satisfied and confident that there are no conflicts of interest with consultants engaged on NAMA preparation work?  It is critical to have public confidence in the project and for that to exist, the public must feel that there are no conflicts of interest  and that what is being done is being done in the public interest.  Will the Minister address the matters of conflict of interest, the current situation, our amendments and answer the question on whether the National Treasury Management Agency is included in the €240 million annual running costs for NAMA?  How much will be incurred per annum by the National Treasury Management Agency for dealing with NAMA's affairs?  How many employees of the National Treasury Management Agency will be engaged in work on behalf of NAMA?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_817" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_956">That is a long list of questions.  I will start with Deputies Bruton and Burton who raised a question and stated they were not sure how one would address it.  One way it is addressed is in section 199 of the legislation which includes a strong criminal provision on confidential information.  Confidential information is defined as meaning "information relating to the commercial or business interests of a participating institution or of a person who is or has been in a relationship with a participating institution".  The definition also includes "information that is subject at law or in equity to a duty of confidentiality" and "information that, if it were contained in a document, would have the result that a person could not be compelled to disclose the document in evidence".  It also includes other considerations.  This offence applies to board members, officers and staff members of NAMA and persons otherwise performing duties on behalf on NAMA or the NTMA.  This extends to a professional person retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">It is essential to provide for a criminal offence in this area because of the sensitivity of the area.  The question is how far beyond that we can go.  To reassure Deputies somewhat, I believe Deputies contributing to this debate did so with a particular context in mind.  This context was the banking crisis we have witnessed to date.  The Minister, the Department and the NTMA have sought and obtained expert advice in the legal, accountancy, banking and investment areas.  That advice has been given and in virtually all cases where it was possible to do so, it was tendered for.  I must state that very competitive rates were obtained in those tenders because of the anxiety of various firms to advise a sovereign State.  It is of attraction for a senior professional body to advise the Government of Ireland because it is a substantial professional cachet for them.  Some of the fees on tender bear no relationship to the commercial rate those firms normally charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The context in the legislation is somewhat different to that context because the volume of professional advice required here is very substantial and somewhat more routine.  When one is engaged in the valuation of a loan, a valuer can be of assistance, but no one valuer will be in a position to value all the loans.  An accountant will also be of assistance in a valuation but no one accountant will be in a position to advise on all of these loans.  In the investigation of the title to the collateral a lawyer, ideally a solicitor, will be of assistance —  it would be rare that any such solicitor would have need to have recourse to counsel except occasionally, so I take it in general that it would be a solicitor.  No one solicitor will be in a position to check the title and legal position of the collateral for all of these loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">The professional services to be provided under the legislation are extensive, as Deputy Burton has been pointing out since the beginning of the debate and she is absolutely right.  While they are extensive in scale, they are more routine in character than the type of professional advice the Government had to have recourse to since the banking crisis began.  They are services for which it is easy to tender.  It is important that the tendering is done in an entirely objective and impartial way, that the NTMA does that tendering and that those who wish to render services are given an opportunity to do so and that the prices are competitive.  It is not as difficult to price these tenders because conveyancers have their price as do solicitors advising generally on banking securities, auctioneers conducting valuations, and accountants evaluating books and the solvency of individuals and their prospects.  All of these matters are measurable for an appropriate fee in a market where there is a great hunger to render professional services.  I do not dispute anything with the Opposition.  I am making the point that this is the context in which all of this professional advice will be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">While I agree with Deputy Rabbitte and other contributors who made the point that Chinese walls are very difficult to sustain in a small jurisdiction, I do not think the area of professional malpractice here will relate to the Chinese walls as such because the decisions are not being taken at such high a level in professional terms that it is a danger.  Rather, the danger is that of the general intimacy of Irish life and the possible coincidence of interest between a given professional person and a given person having his or her loan valued.  The strongest precaution against that must be taken in the tendering procedures which the body itself must take and in the robustness of supervision arrangements for valuation.  There is also the backup of a criminal offence for criminal wrongdoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">That is by way of general introduction to the subject and I will go through the Fine Gael amendments in detail.  I know everyone is trying to do their best on this.  Fine Gael proposes a set of standards for advisers and service providers whereby NAMA would seek to ensure in its contractual relations that each of its advisers and service providers would avoid or manage conflicts of interest.  That is correct but it is provided for in section 43, namely, the management of conflicts of interest.  The proposed amendment goes further, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, and requires this cooling off period of three months after the cessation or completion of a contract for the provision of services under the section.  That should not be in legislation but it is something at which the board could look in the context of its recruitment of advisers because it will have to structure it not only to include a provision like that but to include a number of other provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Amendment No. 85 states that: "NAMA shall not enter into any contract for the provision of services by expert advisers or service providers where such advisers or service providers are likely to have a conflict of interest by reason of their providing, or having provided services to the participating institutions, or to customers or clients of the participating institutions relating to eligible bank assets which have been, or are to be, acquired by NAMA under this Act."  That is very sweeping as a legal provision in a statute and, in effect, it might prevent many persons from advising NAMA who are perfectly reputable.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">This amendment raises the following issue.  There is a great difference between a professional firm, which has rendered advice on an occasional basis for a particular client who happens to be a person who is entering NAMA, and a business, which has systematically depended for the bulk of its business on its relationship with a particular client who is entering into NAMA.  I am not criticising the Deputy because he wanted to raise the issue but the amendment does not address it.  Again, the board will have to address that issue in looking at who it retains.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">Will the Minister ensure the service providers employed by NAMA involve a much broader outlook in terms of economics and the use of land?  One could say the most profitable way to use land is for housing or commercial development in a rising property market but we do not necessarily want to go down that path again because we want sustainable development.  We must deal with issues such as climate change, ensure enough food is produced, develop other niches and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Will we bring in consultants with a different outlook and who will look at land from the perspective of food production, forestry and sustainable planning and who have a very positive view on the need for public space in terms of quality of life and well-being?

The Bill provides that these debt securities may bear no interest if the Minister sees fit.  Was that provision made for a particular reason?  Was there an expectation that interest rates could fall very low and he would need that facility, or does it genuinely indicate some discretion on the part of the Minister to set terms that could be zero?  The same provision is repeated in section 47 in respect of the subordinated bonds we discussed earlier, and the Minister was at pains to point out that these were high-yielding bonds, at 5% at least; yet he is giving himself the legal provision to set the interest at zero.</p>

It is true that in the case of standard bonds, if I can call them that, a study of what has happened in the last year will show it was conceivable at one stage that central banks would set negative interest rates, resulting in a zero bond.  It is more unlikely in the case of the subordinated bond issue because that tends to carry a higher level of coupon.  In both cases the purpose of the section is to ensure the Minister can specify that the bond carries no interest, where appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">Clearly they are a non-cash consideration.  However, the option of paying cash, I presume, is left open.  For example, in a case in which a loan has been realised but there is a fund standing to the account, the fund would simply be transferred to the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">If a loan was on such terms that it only became repayable at a future date, for example, it would be a deferred consideration.  It would not have immediate value.  If we had a loan whose repayment was designated as being at a future and ascertained date but there is no immediate payment obligation on foot of the loan, one could argue that was a deferred consideration.  However, I would prefer to check the matter further for the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1023">I would be interested to hear some examples of what the Minister has in mind, particularly in view of the fact that it is likely there will be all kinds of deals given that the powers of NAMA are wide in terms of deal structures.  The use of a privately controlled SPV increases the scope for such deals.  I would like to get some sense of this through examples.  We know, for example, about the top ten developers and the fact that their loans will be dealt with immediately.  I would like to hear examples of such deals.</p>

          <p eId="para_1024">I presume the Minister is saying that the prospect of interest rates falling to zero, which he said loomed large for a brief time, is less likely as far as we can foresee at the moment.  The structure of what he is putting in place is to allow him the flexibility of an inducement in terms of the debt securities issued.  The banks will be able to make a profit, presumably, on the bond, and that in turn should encourage them to lend it.</p>

Does the Minister intend to stick with the provision set out in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), “bearing interest at such rate as it thinks fit, or no interest”?

          <p eId="para_1028">Although much of the public debate has been devoted to the nature of the bond which the banks will acquire as a result of this operation, it is worth noting that while it gives the bank an opportunity to make money with, as the Deputy pointed out, a low interest rate, as a form of compensation it is rather severe on the bank in the sense that there is a poor return on the money that is given in compensation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">To follow up on Deputy Rabbitte's point, given that the NAMA bonds will be at 1.5% and that €16 billion will go into the banks before Christmas and €38 billion by February, while the Minister — as he explained — cannot dictate to the banks what their interest rate policy will be, it is essential that the banks lend on that money at sustainable rates which, it is reasonable to assume, should be in the range of 1.5% to 3% above the cost of borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I have seen a document which shows that AIB wants to charge customers 4% above the cost of funds, which is unacceptable.  While I appreciate that the Minister cannot dictate on this matter, it should be made clear through whatever controls can be used on the banks that such proposals will not be accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Although not directly related to my previous comments, ACC Bank's current treatment of its customers is also unacceptable.  I have learned of several recent cases in which the bank insisted on having interest and principal repaid from borrowers who are only in a position to pay interest.  It is even insisting on principal and interest being paid on income producing assets held by other banks.  The public should not be intimidated by ACC Bank.  Customers should tell it to go to hell when it seeks interest and principal on mortgages and loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_1032">NAMA will have the power to issue debt carrying the guarantee of the Irish taxpayer.  The Minister's adviser, Dr. Alan Ahearne, has frequently predicted that the debt will, in his own words, wash its face.  However, he has acknowledged that his predictions are made in the context of interest rates which reflect the current period.  While we do not expect rapid increases in interest rates from the ECB, if there is a European recovery over the next 15 months they can be expected to increase by 0.5% every six months.  What will the Minister do when the pool of debt created in our name comes up for renegotiation after the first six months have passed?  This conundrum has never been satisfactorily solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">We know that the NTMA's money managers are currently selling sovereign debt on the market at the rate of €1.5 billion per month in order to meet deficit and other Government borrowing requirements.  If the banks hold onto the debt they receive at the first rates, what guarantee do we have that they will not sell them on at discounted rates?  We know they plan to use the debt on their balance sheets and at the ECB window.  The Minister, in his usual manner, has described a scenario whereby a Canadian company or another investor takes a one third interest in a bank as a sign of strength.</p>

We are proceeding on the basis of a mind boggling estimate of €54 billion.

A performing loan will no longer be available to NAMA for washing its face once it has completed its term.

How much are we willing to allow NAMA to borrow and under what circumstances?</p>

The Minister noted this morning that NAMA could be crippled by an excess of bonds at high interest rates but we will have to deal with increasing interest rates alongside performing loans which have completed their terms.  How does NAMA propose to find replacement income?  Will any limit be imposed on the amount of money we will allow it to borrow on our behalf?</p>

Pressure is being brought to bear to change the interest rate and enable them to pay interest only on their loans.  This is the appropriate time for the Minister to take action and negotiate with the banks while he still has bargaining power.  Once the bonds are issued, the banks will not show the same degree of enthusiasm for listening to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">I hope the Minister will take on board Deputy Fahey's comments on the need to protect ordinary consumers who are meeting their obligations but are coming under pressure to pay higher interest rates, etc.  This is a significant problem given that the only possible outcome of taking such an approach is more property flooding the market as people are forced to sell their homes to meet repayments.</p>

There is nothing in the text of the Bill that requires of the banks that they respond to the generosity of the State and increase the flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">My second point is explicitly related to section 46.  Deputy Lee pointed out the difference between a performing loan, a non-performing loan and a non-performing loan where a person is seeking an accommodation under which only interest will be paid.  Different developers have stated in television interviews that they do not propose to pay penal rates of interest.  The Minister stressed on Second Stage that whatever is owed to any of the institutions covered in the guarantee will remain owed.  The section states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1056">46.—(1) NAMA or a NAMA group entity may, whenever and so often as it thinks fit, create and issue debt securities—</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">Does the term "non-cash consideration" include the changing of the form of guarantee for the original loan?  Mr. Mark Duffy, who is establishing an asset recovery body, has suggested that negotiations on bundles of assets that are supported by a loan will include the option of changing the form of personal guarantee given for the original loan.  Does the Minister envisage NAMA releasing people from the form of guarantee they gave for the original loan to be purchased through the taxpayers' agency, NAMA?</p>

          <p eId="para_1075">In discussing the bonds issued to the banks the Minister indicated that interest rates will increase at a low rate.  It is generally accepted that interest rates will rise.  Will the guaranteed payments to the banks be used to encourage the banks to hold the bonds, receive the interest thereon and commence lending?  There is a concern that in the event that an outsider investor takes a share in the banks, the bonds, which will be tradeable, will be sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Deputy Fahey stated that if interest rates increase, interest income to NAMA from the bonds will also increase.  In that context, €16 billion will be paid out on €54 billion of NAMA debt and €12 billion in interest will be paid on debt with a book value of €77 billion.  There will also be a €4 billion hole to be plugged and a default on €15 billion of assets, which is the magic 20% figure.  No interest will be written off in terms of the bond holders being paid by NAMA.  How much interest will be written off by NAMA in respect of the loans the agency acquires?  Therein lies the answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1077">Deputy O'Donnell has been gazing into a crystal ball.  On Deputy Burton's question as to whether the banks could collectively flood the market with all the six-month treasury notes in one simultaneous operation, while anything is theoretically possible, it is difficult to believe that banks which are systemically involved in the economy would have any interest or incentive so to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The second issue raised by Deputy Burton was whether the phrase "deferred consideration" could be reconsidered and whether it covered some other conspiratorial move in relation to the Bill.  That is not the case.  This is a standard formula that has been used in legislation of this type.  I will consider deleting it if Deputies wish it to be deleted but we are better sticking to hallowed formulae, even when on occasion they simply benefit from repetition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Deputy Lee noted that interest rates are historically at a very low level and therefore some increase in interest rates is inevitable.  What are the implications of this in terms of the six-month notes that are issued?  The implication is that the notes are issued at the applicable rate from time to time.  It is almost in the nature of a floating rate note that the State is issuing and it will vary depending on the applicable rate during the six-month period.  That is how this is structured in the legislation.  I draw the attention of Deputies Lee and O'Donnell to the fact that the business plan expressly envisages interest rate rises and they are factored into the projections in the plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">In regard to performing and non-performing loans, as Deputy Lee correctly noted, a performing loan is discharged by the payment of the interest and, eventually, in the final period of repayment, the payment of the principal itself.  In relation to a non-performing loan, the whole point and essence of the agency is that it has time to enforce the security over the asset, hold it if necessary for better market conditions, dispose of it immediately if market conditions are suitable, which they may well be in some other jurisdictions, and in any event realise the asset within its term and thereby repay money and an income stream to the agency.  The business plan is clear that the estimated flow of income to fund the bonds stems, as Deputy Lee correctly pointed out, from the performing loans in the earlier years.  In the later years it will stem from the realisation of the underlying assets in the non-performing loans.  That is the broad nature of what it envisaged.</p>

NAMA steps into the shoes of the bank and has the exact same rights, for better or for worse, that the bank has.  If the bank has a personal guarantee the agency has a personal guarantee.  If the bank releases a party from its personal guarantee that must be factored into the valuation of the loan and the loan is thereby devalued.  If a bank opted to release someone from his or her personal guarantee the valuation process would set a lower value on that loan.  The agency stands into the shoes of the bank, insofar as it is a creditor of that bank customer.  The agency has all the same rights, and some additional statutory rights which we will deal with later in the Bill, against the debtor.</p>

          <p eId="para_1107">It cannot happen.  We want to enforce the security where that is appropriate.  The one great advantage of the agency, as I have always pointed out, is that it has every incentive to enforce those loans which should be enforced.  That is not necessarily the position with the banking system at present because of the fear the system has about the scale of the write downs involved.  It is a fundamental difference between the agency and the current banking system, because the current banking system has an incentive to deny its exposures.  The agency has every incentive to realise a gain for the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">In enforcement operations the agency must conduct itself as a bank would, acting in accordance with proper commercial and prudential considerations.

In the first three years the business plan envisages that, of the €9.6 billion due in interest, only €4.5 billion will be collected.  In other words, there will be €5 billion of interest income which was due but not collected.  Where will it go?  Going on the Minister's basis that everything can be recovered, that figure should appear somewhere.  In the first three years alone the sum is €5 billion.  If one ran that figure for the rest of the period, the €5 billion would probably go up to €10 billion, or perhaps €15 billion, effectively of interest the Minister was not able to collect although it was due. Does that money go into the ether?  Is it written off by NAMA?  If so, under what powers will NAMA write it off?

          <p eId="para_1154">The Minister has said he will look to recover all loans with regard to their recoverability.  He gave a cash flow statement which is not the same as a profit and loss statement.  He gave a profit and loss statement for three years.  I would have thought, in the interests of completeness and proper transparency, that a budget projection of profit and loss would be made for the following seven years and we would then do a reconciliation in terms of the cash flow which is showing at €5.48 billion of profit, with the profit or loss as per the budget projections.  The Minister is taking over €77 billion of debt.  Let us say €62 billion of that is being repaid which, according to the Minister, is 80%.  The way to bring proper transparency to this issue is to produce budget projections of profit and loss for the full ten years, as the Minister has done with the cash flow projections.  Any bank would require as much in the provision of any business plan.</p>

I have raised this matter on the Order of Business, as the Minister knows, and with the Taoiseach.  Will there be an opportunity within or without this Bill to discuss that document?  It would seem the Minister's intention, as expressed in the Bill, is to facilitate the banks involved to a significant degree and to provide the extension of many, if not all, sections of last year's guarantee on a five-year rolling basis.</p>

We had yesterday's experience of the SPV and, given that we are discussing this section, it is appropriate that we raise the question of the rolling five-year extension of the guarantee.  This matter is not covered by the legislation, but the statement was issued with the legislation and seems integral to the Bill's content.  Will the Minister clarify the issue, make arrangements to discuss it with the committee or, as I have requested previously, provide for a debate in the House?</p>

This will be done in respect of everything but the tier 2 subordinated debt and fresh debt issued by institutions after the guarantee period where those institutions felt sufficiently strong about doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The financial situations are wrapped up, given the Minister's intention to provide them with a warm environment.  The Opposition's difficulty is that we are learning of arrangements that are subject to negotiations with EUROSTAT and are not just off the balance sheet, but off the Leinster House site.  The Minister waltzed into the Chamber with a <i>fait accompli</i> about which doing anything would be almost impossible.  After a change of Government, the Minister’s scenario will have placed an incredible level of commitment on his successors.  Since we all know one of the solutions to the current crisis is an election and change of Government, it is important that the Minister be forthcoming to the House regarding the guarantee’s design.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">I have been highly forthcoming.  We introduced legislation in the House, which had an extensive debate about what was envisaged.  We all know that, on foot of the guarantee, much of the banks' funding will expire on 30 September 2010.  This is an issue of importance that Deputy Burton, in the unlikely event of her being in government, will be forced to address upon her appointment, for example, as Minister for Finance.  This will be one among a large number of issues that Opposition parties in general seem unwilling to face.  We are not at that stage yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">As far as giving information to the House is concerned, I am more than forthcoming and more than willing to give the Deputy all of the information she wants, including an official briefing on the guarantee.  However, it would help public opinion if we did not constantly misrepresent everything as a conspiracy against the people.  It is a grave position.  I have adopted the advice I have received from my officials, the NTMA, the Central Bank and others.  I have criticised and varied it on occasion, always with a view to the taxpayer's protection and the development of a sustainable banking system.  This is what every Deputy should be doing.  There is no point in pretending that something unusual or conspiratorial occurred on 29 September 2008.  It did not.</p>

          <p eId="para_1201">Section 46 on the NAMA group entity.  Should the investors not be paying a fee for the use of that guarantee, given that the SPV will be a profit-oriented private institution?  I would have serious concerns about the amount the entity will be allowed to issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">Before the break, the Minister stated that the most cautious assumptions were used for the draft business plan and I made the point that there was nothing cautious about them.  He stated that the loans to go into NAMA would comprise 40% in performing loans and 60% in non-performing loans.  If the Minister collected 100% of the performing loans and all of that money, he would still need a very significant return on the non-performing loans to break even.  We know from the Irish Glass Bottle Company site and from the Zoe development group and the value of the lands that the value of everything is down to about one quarter.  The Minister would need to double the value of those to break even on the non-performing loans.  This means a very significant increase over a period of ten years in the overall market for development whether that is land or the building and development area.  It means a 9% per year increase for ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">This would seem to be a significant risk.  Given that this private entity over that period of time will issue all of these bonds as it sees fit, when it sees fit, on the back of our guarantee, should there not be some limits expressed in the legislation about how much it should be?  Should there not be a fee paid to the State for that private institution issuing those bonds on the back of our guarantee?  Are they entitled to it for free?</p>

          <p eId="para_1233">Deputies will have an opportunity to develop this.  This amendment proposes to delete all words outlined and to substitute "5 per cent of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value".  That is the reference to the subordinated debt.  In section 48, my amendment No. 91 will propose to delete "the amount specified by the Minister by order" and substitute the following: "€54,000,000,000 or such other amount as the Minister may specify by order".  The amendment caps the amount to be spent by NAMA on the acquisition of bank assets at €54 billion, thus increasing the level of information for taxpayers and markets about how much NAMA will cost.  As preparations have advanced it has allowed the NTMA to further hone in its estimates of the assets to be acquired and how much these assets are likely to cost.  It is appropriate that a cap be placed on this amount so as not to potentially expose the taxpayer to an ever-escalating amount of assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The issue of the valuation of the Irish Glass Bottle Company site was raised by Deputy Lee and I will reply to it lest it be raised again.  He made a legitimate point but the error he has made is in generalising from one valuation to the entire property sector.  The provisions in this Bill — if we reach them — provide for the individual valuation of each bank asset.  For example, were that asset to come into valuation with NAMA, it would be valued in accordance with its true value.</p>

          <p eId="para_1235">I do not wish to devote the entire time to this issue when we have not yet reached discussion of the valuation issue.  It is important that the Minister would set out more clearly than he has to date why he believes that having a larger volume of subordinated bonds held by the banks would undermine the whole NAMA exercise.  He seemed to advance two arguments as I understood it.  One argument was that the banks' value would be dramatically impaired because these would become, as I understood him to say, part of their core equity, tier 1, and they would not have a value.  This is what I understand he seemed to be saying.  The other argument was that NAMA's finances would be blasted if there were larger amounts of subordinated bonds because they would have a higher interest coupon.  I find it very difficult to accept those arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">The Minister had a choice.  He can do what he is suggesting, which is to pay €7,000 million in a market uplift which is voluntary.  He is paying more than the market value on a voluntary basis but I do not know why.  The alternative is not to pay and to keep that €7 billion in his pocket.  The banks are short of capital so the Minister substitutes the capital and is given shares.  The taxpayer now owns bank shares instead of owning this long-term economic hope.  It is clear it is better to own bank shares in banks that have been cleansed of their debt than to own the equivalent amount of money in this long-term hope.  How does the Minister repair the fact and make it more fair?  The Green Party came up with the notion of sharing this risk equally, this hope.  The hope will not all be on the taxpayer; half the hope will be on the bank.  However, the Minister does not do that.  If instead of NAMA we had the €7 billion in bank shares, that would be a good outcome.  We would have a share in the upside in the banks that the Minister has now cleansed.  If he had the subordinated bonds at least the banks' shareholders and bondholders——</p>

          <p eId="para_1242">Yes.  I ask the Minister to explain why he decided that he would not do what we understood he would do, which is to share the risk as outlined by the Green Party.  He decided not to do this, reasoning that the 5% is a bridge too far.  He needs to explain this more thoroughly to the House.  The taxpayer would have certainty in having more bank shares.  The taxpayer now has something that is far less sure in its circumstance.  We are having to fund the whole €54 billion and we have very little to show for it.  We will come back to the valuation issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">There is consensus across the Opposition that paying too much for these assets is a bad move.  We would be better paying the conservative price or the market price and take our bank shares by some form of recapitalisation as being a better outcome.  The Minister needs to explain why he decided this was not a better outcome.  What are the downsides of doing that which seems to be the logical course of action?</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">Having done what I regard as the illogical course of action, why has the Minister come up with such a pussyfooted solution to the risk sharing, the 5% ceiling?  I do not accept the argument that NAMA would be crippled by this high interest coupon.  According to the Minister's legislation, if he wished to do so, he could charge 0% interest for these coupons because that is provided for.</p>

As I understand it, there are banks in very deep trouble which need to unload and the Minister is trying to design a risk sharing mechanism.  It is not credible for the Minister to state that he could not have a more robust risk sharing mechanism because he is scared out of his wits that they would seek a high coupon on such a mechanism.  The Minister is in the driving seat and he can tell investors that subordinated bonds will be issued with a low coupon.  The Minister can issue them in whatever way he chooses.  I seek a more substantial explanation from the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_1247">As in all these debates Deputies and commentators keep referring to "the banks, the banks, the banks".  At the conclusion of this Bill, five eighths of the banks will be under public control or ownership.  That is five eighths of the banks in so far as the assets being translated to NAMA are concerned.  Why?  The reason is that Anglo Irish Bank is 100% nationalised, of which we are all aware.  By virtue of the share arrangement proposed in a subsequent amendment, the building societies are under effective public control.  No depositor enrichment can take place by virtue of the controls the Minister will enjoy as a result of these shareholdings and we have already acquired 25% of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  However, since last August I have heard nothing but that the banks are being enriched, and Deputy Bruton has echoed that in the Chamber this evening.  We are already in a position of control of five eighths of the banks.  The debate is not if we should somehow acquire a further shareholding for the taxpayer, but whether we end up in a 100% State control position.  Any Government would have to have regard to the dangers of moving towards such a 100% position.  That is the first preliminary point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">It has been entirely ignored in this debate that if one examines the balance sheets of the institutions and the assets to be transferred, five eighths of the banks are at the risk of the taxpayer in the sense that the taxpayer is the owner or substantial controller of the institutions concerned.  This is five eighths of the assets comprised in NAMA in effect and in value.  This means all bonds issued to Anglo Irish Bank are issuing to an institution which is already wholly owned by the taxpayer.  The question of risk sharing does not arise in that case.  However, a far greater capital investment would arise if we decided on a deeper discount and one which would have to be funded at world money market rates of 4% to continue to fund the entity.  What would arise in respect of the building societies and the case of Anglo Irish Bank would be a similar pattern if we went down the road advocated by Deputy Bruton.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">This means the only two institutions participating in this arrangement that still have a private shareholding are Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  Even in the case of these institutions, there is a 25% shareholding already held.  I appreciate it is a warrant, but in substance it is a real economic interest of 25% of the institution.  This means in the case of both of these institutions that the taxpayer is not at a 100% hazard by virtue of the investments already made and the stakeholding.  The taxpayer is at a 75% risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">Let us focus on the risk we are trying to eliminate.  There has been much talk about risk sharing.  However, as far as five eighths of these assets are concerned, there is no need to even consider the issue of risk sharing in the first place.  That does not mean subordinated debt should not issue to those institutions.  As we agreed in the debate, it would provide an incentive for the institutions to work harder and that, of itself, is of value.  However, it means we are focussed now exclusively on two remaining financial institutions which still have a significant private presence.  The question will arise at the conclusion of NAMA as to what the capital arrangements will be for these institutions.  Clearly, since the whole effect of NAMA is to accelerate losses, this equally results in an acceleration of capital requirements.  We do not have the exact quantum and the figure I provided in September was an estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">To some extent, the two banks can make provisions against their losses from their existing profits.  That is altogether possible.  The fact remains that in current market conditions there is no great appetite to invest in them, although I do not maintain it is necessarily the case that the State would have to capitalise these institutions further.  As I made clear last April before this entire debate began, any further State investment in these institutions would be by way of plain, unvarnished equity capital, not preferential shares.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1253">It would be simple equity.  The point is significant and it means the risk sharing mechanisms are a good deal larger than Deputy Bruton admitted in his question because the mechanism agreed covers a further substantial tranche of that long-term economic value to the tune of approximately €2.8 billion on the estimates before us.  This figure could vary depending on the eventual NAMA valuations and how the valuations of the individual assets result.  The precise risk sharing mechanism designed is a form of subordinated debt issued by the agency or group, as the case may be, to the particular bank.  It carries a coupon.  As subordinated debt the coupon would be pitched at 6%, 7% or 8%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">I heard Deputy Bruton suggest that I am the master and that I could set subordinated debt at a 0% coupon.  I do not know what markets would think of the commerciality of any bank issued with subordinated debt at a 0% coupon.  I do not believe any money market considering this would suggest it is a credible policy of a Government to adopt because it is an unheard of instrument.  One might as well say one is issuing a bond with no rate of interest.  Such a measure would also avoid the one advantage of the more generous coupon, that is, an incentive for the bank to perform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The instrument was selected to meet the requirement of risk sharing.  Why would other instruments not work?  We considered the option of share warrants, in other words, a procedure whereby the bank would have a warrant on NAMA and we would have a warrant on the bank.  Such warrants are valued in the same way as ordinary shares, as are preferential debt arrangements in excess of 5%.  All such arrangements are valued on a mark-to-market basis.  What does this mean?  A mark-to-market basis means that if the subordinated debt exceeded 5% it would have been valued at a much lower figure on a mark-to-market basis and, therefore, it would not have amounted to compensation to the bank for what we are taking in any event.  It would not actually count or work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">The banks have participated in this scheme and have not mounted any legal challenges.  We had to plan this legislation on the basis of compulsion.  However, we have had participation and co-operation from the banks which has obviated many potential legal challenges.  One could not argue that it was simply compensation if some of the paper issued to the banks did not have a definite value placed upon it.  These are some of the considerations that weighed against the use of subordinated debt beyond 5%.  In addition, and as I remarked this morning, the coupon will be reviewed every year and in all probability the principal will be reviewed.  The bond must be structured but it would be at the end of ten years.  It may be a perpetual bond with a call at ten years.  These are matters of detail to which the NTMA must attend, but that is the broad concept involved.  The board of NAMA would have the right to withhold payment of the coupon in any one year and the principal at the call date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">The fact remains that this type of debt instrument carries a higher rate of interest.  If one were to provide that half the debt should be subordinated, then NAMA would have a very significant interest bill to discharge.  That is the reality.  As it stands, the subordinated debt covers 5% of the total amount of long-term economic value.  The degree of public ownership and control covers a separate 55%.  Any residual sum may be dealt with by way of levy at the end of the ten-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">Professor Honohan's suggestion was very wise.  I was always interested in risk sharing mechanisms but it was difficult to identify one.  The initial position of the Government was that we would recoup any loss to the taxpayer through the use of long-term economic value and through a levy on the banking system.  However, that would have been somewhat indiscriminate in its effects.  It would have rewarded the bad bank as much as the good bank and the bank that performs better would have to pay the same as the bank that performs worse.  All in all, I believe the risk sharing mechanism was a useful device.  Within standard accounting principles, it has been used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">However, the idea that other options exist in respect of the use of such subordinated debt is wrong because they do not.  I have gone as far as I can in the risk sharing mechanism that is provided.  Moreover, this is not the only risk sharing mechanism in the Bill.  As I have already explained, the volume of State investment or control in the banking system stands at 55% with a strong possibility that this proportion will rise.  In addition, I will provide on Report Stage for a charge in the form of a levy at the end of the ten-year period for any residual sum that might be outstanding in that event.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Far from neglecting the interests of the taxpayer, I have been assiduous in considering how protection can be given.  I wish to return to the question of long-term economic value in a moment because the Deputy wishes to peg this discussion on that, which is fair enough.  Apart from the question of long-term economic value, the valuation procedures in this Bill are highly important as those valuation principles will set the underlying valuations.  As for any risk associated with the long-term economic value, I have explained how at a minimum, such risk is decreased from 15% to 10% because of the operation of the subordinated debt issue.  Moreover, of that 10%, 5.5% is gone, through the State ownership of the residual.  However, even allowing for all of that, the question of the underlying valuations is equally as important as the long-term economic valuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">As for the reason long-term economic value was used, the practice in Europe has been to recognise that concept because the entire purpose of an asset relief scheme is to restore credit and credibility to the banking system and the use of the long-term economic value means that the bank is not selling the assets on a distressed basis but on a realistic hold to maturity basis.  The accounting rules in the United States have been revised to reflect that system of valuation in the context of bank assets.  In the context of European practice, the European Central Bank did not condemn the practice.  It stated it should be used with caution, which is exactly what I have done.  Furthermore, the advice of both the outgoing governor and the governor designate of the Central Bank of Ireland was that I had not been disproportionate in my use of it, especially having regard to the risk sharing mechanisms built into the legislation.  That is the advice I received on this matter, which was reasonable.  If one takes a 10% increase over ten years, I can tell members this evening that the price of a pint of Guinness or a pint of milk, irrespective of any budgetary or fiscal considerations, will increase by more in the next ten years.  The increase in property values in the last ten years was wholly unrealistic and wholly disproportionate.  However, an increase of 10% over the next ten years is highly realistic, conservative and cautious.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_1080">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1275">I wish to draw attention to amendment No. 87 in section 47 in the Minister's name, in which he proposes to insert "5 per cent of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value".  In a roundabout and long-winded fashion, the Minister explained how that total portfolio acquisition value was arrived at.  His confession suggested that the mechanism of evaluation and approach he has adopted has to some extent failed.  Following this presentation, it strikes me there may be things about the banks that the Minister ought to tell members.  While bank shares have been falling again, perhaps the Minister, as usual, knows more than do other members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">My point regarding the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value is that in using that formula, to which the Minister referred in his comments, he intends to overpay significantly for the assets.  This is at the heart of this debate.  The Minister's definition of both market value and his application of a long-term economic value allows a formula in which the taxpayer will overpay consciously for the distressed loans of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">Members already have referred to the schedule in the draft business plan, which shows that at present, the valuations contain a rolled-up interest value of €9 billion.  I do not believe one would find any takers for the proposition that the €9 billion will be repaid, other than to a minute degree.  As the draft business plan has been prepared and given the forecasts that are set out therein, a question arises in respect of performing loans.  The draft business plan allows performing loans to include, if it is within the contract terms of those loans, further rolled up interest amounts.  The existing €9 billion, taken with the further rolled up interest amounts, which in a conservative estimate could amount to between €2 billion and €4 billion, will bring the rolled up interest amounts involved to between €11 billion and €13 billion.  Respected commentators have used those valuations — I see the Minister nodding in agreement — to the effect that the further rolled up interest included in the Minister's outline of cash flows and income flows is likely to be in the order of €2 billion to €4 billion in respect of what are called performing loans.  This is because the latter include a calculation and a permission for rolled up interest to be included and to be described as income flows in the draft business plan.  They will not be described as cash flows because it is unlikely that much of this rolled up interest will ever manifest itself in a cash flow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">However, when the Minister refers to his 5% of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value, it is important, as he has acknowledged in his contribution, that it includes elements such as rolled up interest.  As the Minister described it, this is the mechanism for overpaying the banks to a considerable extent.  He identified two banks, namely, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, as being the institutions on which he particularly wished to focus.  He referred to those banks because he referred to other banks as being in a kind of hopeless position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1310">I appreciate that and I am about to finish.  The critical issue in the Minister's amendment is a figure of 5% of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value.  We know that 5% is a degraded interpretation of the mechanism Professor Honohan proposed in good faith for risk sharing as a solution to the crisis.  In classic Fianna Fáil fashion, this was interpreted in a particular way.  Our absent friends in the Green Party chose to clutch at this as a figleaf.  In the greater scheme of things, the 5% in subordinated debt does not matter a fig because it is the 95% of the direct debt that is going immediately into our national debt.  Our taxpayers must support this while banks that are severely damaged, if not completely crippled by the events of the past two years in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, will be unable to lend to decent credit risks and start to build this economy again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">I refer to the last point Deputy Burton made about subordinated debt securities.  I want to clarify the Honohan amendment for the historical record.  Professor Honohan suggested a risk sharing mechanism that did not leave subordinated bonds of dubious value on the balance sheets of the banks but advocated that shareholders and investors should share in the risk of NAMA.  As Deputy Burton said, the Green Party became persuaded of that and announced that when the Bill would be before the House there would be a risk sharing mechanism involving investors and shareholders taking a share of the risk.  Very cleverly the Minister adapted — not adopted — the Honohan amendment for his own purposes.  Fortunately, it coincided with Professor Honohan's elevation to the post of Governor of the Central Bank, which has been universally welcomed and well merited.</p>

          <p eId="para_1313">If I was charged of this issue on 29 September I would probably have reacted differently to the Minister, although it is easy to be wise in hindsight.  Given Professor Honohan's international reputation, in the weeks preceding it I would have asked him to construct a recovery plan for me and then invited five or six economists who know something on this area to interrogate the plan.  That did not happen, we took on board an economist and imposed him on the NTMA, which does not have expertise in banking.  It is important that the record of the House does not stand with the Minister continuing to say that he took on board the Professor Honohan amendment.  Professor Honohan, unfortunately, is silenced and cannot speak out on this matter but this was not his proposition and it was not the way he wanted to go.</p>

The Green Party members have not come near us to defend any of the major gains they announced as the legislation evolved.

          <p eId="para_1346">I want to make a point on the 10% because it is in the public interest that we understand it.  From what benchmark is the Minister calculating this 10%?  As far as I understand it from reading all of the various accounts, many of which suggest the property market has another 10% to go while others are more pessimistic, very few people suggest that it has bottomed out.  We understand the peak was in January 2007 or whenever, but from where is the Minister calculating a 10% recovery?  People will ask about this because they will want to anticipate whether long-term economic value will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">In many cases, a difference between long-term economic value and market value is that market value is usually calculable and it has a built in anticipation of the market.  On Second Stage, the definition involved the market in stable conditions.  Most people in the banking fraternity began to use wild language such as "turmoil".  We certainly did not get stable conditions from which one could calculate a yield.  I am interested in how the Minister would ever measure long-term economic value and I am more interested in from where he is calculating a 10% recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_1348">To continue on that theme, on a couple of occasions in recent days the Minister mentioned that the thinking would appear to be that property values have bottomed out.  That would not be my opinion and I do not think it is the opinion of anybody else.  If I understood him correctly, the Minister also seemed to reference European property values.  There is a vast difference between the cantilevered values in this country and the over-valuation in other parts of Europe.  It was quite obvious to everybody over the past ten years that property values here far exceeded anything comparable in any part of Europe.  I cannot understand where the Minister got his presumption that we have bottomed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">Last evening, in response to something I stated, the Minister said we have gone back to property values of approximately three years ago.  We have not.  Our property values have not nearly bottomed out and anybody who examines properties for sale and checks with valuation agents will find that out very quickly.  If people want to acquire a property at present, the first problem they will run into is one of which the Minister is well aware, which is that they cannot get funding or borrow.  The banks do not want to hear from them.</p>

The Minister said at one stage that the market value would be a distressed value.  The way he is defining market value has nothing to do with fire sales or distressed assets; it is clearly about prudence and people acting knowledgeably and without compulsion, at arm's length.  It is about what a willing buyer would pay.  It is factoring in a normal market value in the present conditions.  When we then come to talk about long-term economic value, it is not a question of moving from distressed to some sort of norm but of the long-term historical average.  The Minister is taking the view that we will get back onto a curve that shoots off into orbit.</p>

He is coming up with a levy that will be applied to all banks, even those that behaved relatively sensibly.  The purpose of his levy will recoup any loss by NAMA and hit them all as if they were all equally to blame.  That is an unfair principle.  If the Minister wants, as he tells us he does, a bank levy that seeks to recoup on behalf of the taxpayer the damage that was done if NAMA is unsuccessful, he cannot apply it in such a way that the banks that have been most prudent will pay as much as those that have been totally feckless in their approach.</p>

That is what the Minister is paying over and above the market price of the loans NAMA is taking from those two banks.  That is a lot of money, yet he is only asking them to take subordinated bonds to the tune of €1.7 billion.

          <p eId="para_1378">I cannot say I have been convinced by his case, although I know he will not deviate from it.  There is much at stake here.  We are talking about real debt, not magic money.  Whether we get it off the balance sheet or not, it is real money that Ireland will have to pay.  The Minister said it was cheap money, but it is only cheap for the next six months; it could be dearer in two years' time.  The Minister is pretending it is a great bargain, but he has the facility to borrow cheaply in the money markets for six months.  It is not wonderful value; it will change as interest rates rise.  It is not ten-year money but six-month money, and it is subject to the ECB changing the terms on which it will make it available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">There are many who have said not only will the ECB change the terms, but the European Commission will also be setting down terms on how banking will proceed, because the Minister is going for long-term economic value over the market value, which means that State aid is implicit.  That is another concern that is exercising the markets.  It is clearly one of the elements of going down this route that is causing concern.</p>

We are in the first instance relying on predictions from the Department of Finance — and we know how accurate they have been over the last five or six years — but we are also relying on the banks to give us figures on distressed loans, although we know they have been downright dishonest.  The draft NAMA business plan states: "The interim NAMA team has not had direct access to individual transaction records and loan files and will not be in a position to verify the integrity of the data until it carries out its own due diligence on each of the loans proposed for acquisition."  That pretty much says it all.  In due course, the Minister will rely on the fact that he did not have accurate information as a reason the whole thing fell apart.  We are in a complete vacuum.  In view of the extent of the gamble that is being pursued, it is unworthy of the Government to impose such a risk on the Irish people.</p>

Is the Minister still of that view?  If not, what has changed his mind?</p>

That is the definition of market value as it exists in an actual market in current conditions.  When the preparatory work on NAMA began this summer, questions arose in regard to valuations.  Many advocates of banking interests argued incorrectly that their assets could not be valued at present.  There is always a market and a current market value.  That is what Deputies implied when they referred to the evidence presented in the Zoe case.  Everyone will accept that the current market is distressed and unstable.  Perhaps Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to this unconsciously, in which case he is free to withdraw his comment, but the long-term concept is a stable market.</p>

In section 47, however, NAMA is specifically empowered to issue subordinated debt securities, although the word "may" is used in this regard.  In addition, the subordinated debt securities are to be used only for the purpose of providing part of the consideration for the acquisition of bank assets in accordance with section 89, which deals in part with overseas assets held by the banks.  As the Minister indicated, the total amount of subordinated debt securities shall not exceed 5% and such securities shall be issued by the participating institutions <i>pro rata</i>.

          <p eId="para_1494">I refer to section 47(2).</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">The Minister has defined the aggregate as 5% of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value.  This brings us to another point in the draft business plan on which I ask him to elaborate.  He has done all sorts of mathematical gymnastics on the calculations of values.  I remain extremely concerned that the description of the book split in the business plan refers to €49 billion in land and development and €28 billion in associated assets and investments.  The business plan suggests the associated investments are more reliable and functioning to a greater extent than the land and development assets.  Many of them are, I presume, what are known as performing investments, not in the sense of rolled up interest but in that they produce income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">Will the Minister update the House on where the €28 billion in performing associated investments now stands, given that all the evidence shows that rent rates are falling dramatically?  While we have not yet seen a schedule of these associated investments, as far as we know many of them are in areas such as shopping centres and various types of office, retail and business parks.  We have been importuned on all sides of the House to make provision for downward rent reviews — a Labour Party amendment on this issue will be moved later — to enable struggling business people who are hanging on by their finger nails in retail parks and shopping centres to benefit from the fall in the market and allow rent rates to reflect what has taken place in the market.  The valuations provided in these sections are structured to keep market values artificially high, which is deeply unwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">The Minister referred to accountancy advice when he commented on Deputy Higgins's observations on economic and long-term value.  We have all spoken at length about the 53% decline in the value of the distressed assets.  Where stands the valuation of the associated assets of €28 billion as performing assets given that rents are falling?</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">Many business people have between now and Christmas to turn a small profit to pay their rent and continue to hang in.  After Christmas, they will have January sales.  Interestingly, according to the schedule half of the NAMA portfolio is to have been transferred by the end of February when the Christmas season and January sales will be over.  I presume that by the beginning of March businesses which have hung on by their finger nails and have been operating in an environment in which rents have been sustained at an artificially high level by the Government in order to facilitate——</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1500">I am addressing the section which deals with how values are to operate and how the issuance of debt and subordinated debt is related, as the Minister has provided for in his amendment, to a notion of the aggregate total portfolio acquisition value.  While distressed assets have been discussed at length, we have not had any information from the Minister about the €28 billion of associated assets from which rents and income flow.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us as to what comprises the €28 billion of associated assets included in the total portfolio acquisition value and which he has said is being valued not at a long-term economic value but at a current value because, presumably, rent rates are being kept artificially high.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">Before we move onto the section on valuation, we need direction and information from the Minister.  It might be a note from his officials that sets out the actual content of the €28 billion referred to.  There are people in the real world who, in the period coming up to Christmas, have a small or medium business and are paying exorbitant rents and cannot get any relief in terms of downward rent reviews because the purpose of the exercise we are discussing here is to artificially inflate property values with a view to passing on the maximum value to the banks, rather than the Minister recognising that all these values, unfortunately, are taking a big hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">If the Minister wants to inject money into the banks he should do so honourably and directly in the form of a direct equity investment.  If he does it in the form of equity, rather than in the form of overstated valuations, there is probably some hope of our banking system recovering, but in the mechanism he is proposing——</p>

          <p eId="para_1518">On the substantial issue the Deputy raised on rent and rent yields, there has already been a 16% drop in the value of rents since last September and in drawing up estimates and the business plan for NAMA, not alone has it been factored in but a continued anticipated further decrease in rent has also been anticipated.  We know this is the first year since 1931 where the cost of living has reduced by about 7%.  If one takes the rent fall as the most dramatic of those figures, it stands at 16% at this stage, whereas the cost of food, for example, has only dropped by 4% and the cost of clothing by 12%.  That has all happened this year.  None of us, including my officials and those working on this at the NTMA, is in denial about that.  They are well aware of the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">In regard to the split to which the Deputy rightly drew attention, the €49 billion relating to the land and development book is the whole portfolio.  It includes performing and non-performing assets.  The associated assets are in the commercial book but are not related to land and development projects under way, therefore the bulk of them relate to commercial property.  It could be retail, office or residential space.  It is commercial property in respect of which rent is being received.  That is what comprises the associated loans and the reason it is suggested there is a measure of performance in those loans is that unlike the land and development loans, where the financing model depended on the last development to fund the next one, these loans, by and large, relate to securities which have an income yield.  It is not necessarily a sufficient income yield for the loan, but they have an income yield.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">It was important to take these assets within the ambit of this agency because clearly they are connected.  They are associated precisely because they are associated with persons in the €49 billion land and development book.  We could not have a position where we were managing these large loan portfolios where one asset would be left alone as a performing loan and another block of assets would be taken over on a systemic basis by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">On the suggestion that we want to sustain rents at artificially high levels, nothing could be further from the truth.  We have factored into our plans a continued depreciation in rental values and that is what is to be expected in the context of the current economic position.  That is fully factored into the assumptions in the business plan.</p>

I do not have the information to hand as to when the commencement date will be fixed, but clearly the Minister, as is normal with legislation of that character, will fix an appropriate commencement date.

          <p eId="para_1551">I would never accuse the Deputy of being a slow learner.  The amendment caps the amount to be spent by the agency on the acquisition of bank assets at €54 billion, thus increasing the level of information for markets and taxpayers about how much the agency will cost.  As preparations for the agency have advanced, it has allowed us further hone our estimates of the assets to be acquired and how much those assets are likely to cost.  It is appropriate that a cap be placed on the amount so as not to potentially expose the taxpayer to an ever escalating amount of assets.  Any order to vary this cap can only be made by positive resolution of Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1552">I wish to raise two points about this amendment.  First, it seems very unusual for the Minister to embed in legislation a figure which he keeps telling us is only an estimate and as there will be detailed market valuations, the figure may be very different.  It seems strange that this would be embedded in that fashion as the more normal practice would be to act by order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553">The other issue is that in this legislation, the Minister has envisaged identifying other types of stressed assets and there is no doubt that some of the now performing elements of various loan books or residential properties may become stressed.  Is the Minister seeking to restrict the opportunity to look at other types of loan book by capping at the value of developer loans?  Again, it seems strange for the Minister to give himself power in this way, although admittedly he must come back to the Oireachtas.  The Minister seems to be putting a figure into legislation and it is difficult to understand why he has decided to bed this down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1554">Is the Minister looking to give a signal that the values will not be dramatically below this level and we will not do much better than we think?  It seems strange for the Minister to change the original section, which provided that the Minister would make an order in the normal course of events.  It would be a standard operation for the Minister to make an order when he saw the valuation process developments.  It is odd to come in with the very specific figure, which we know is yet to be determined.</p>

I am not pressing this particular amendment if that is the view of the House, although I thought it better to be up front and state in the legislation the estimated figure.  There should be no reading into this that in some sense, this is the figure that will be handed out.  I would not like that presumption or inference to be taken from the mention of the figure in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1558">Is my recollection faulty or did this amendment arise as a consequence of the negotiations with the Greens?  The original had a certain value as subsection (4) stated that the aggregate of all debts, securities, etc., shall not exceed the amount specified by the Minister.  Where the Minister proposed to make an order, a draft had to be laid before the Dáil and a resolution of the Dáil had to be passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">There is a scenario where property prices would continue to fall; the general consensus is that the bottom of Irish property prices may be reached in the first quarter or half of 2010.  We hope this is true.  This valuation of €54 billion was arrived at some time ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_1561">The €54 billion includes the overvaluation of the €7 billion but to be honest, it could be mentioned as a potentially excessive amount given that prices have continued to fall.  The Minister has spoken of the level of diligence that will be carried out with the different parts of the portfolio.  It seems that putting in €54 billion may be to suggest a higher figure for the taxpayer to undertake than in a continuously falling market is likely to be the case.  There was more merit in the original.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">My memory is that the agreement to act in this way might be associated with the discussions, preferenda, etc., that took place around the time of the Green Party conference, which was only two weeks ago.  Will the Minister tell us who he was thinking about when he drafted this amendment?</p>

We must enact this rather than having repetitive debates of this character in the House about valuations.  This is the sum of money which, at this stage, is estimated as the maximum the agency will require.  It needs that sanction and it is important for it to be put in the legislation.</p>

He should see there is an opportunity to debate. At that stage we would have the business plan and the valuation outcomes and we would be able to form a view on what the appropriate ceiling would be.

There is an obligation on the Minister to set out his thinking with regard to this section.
