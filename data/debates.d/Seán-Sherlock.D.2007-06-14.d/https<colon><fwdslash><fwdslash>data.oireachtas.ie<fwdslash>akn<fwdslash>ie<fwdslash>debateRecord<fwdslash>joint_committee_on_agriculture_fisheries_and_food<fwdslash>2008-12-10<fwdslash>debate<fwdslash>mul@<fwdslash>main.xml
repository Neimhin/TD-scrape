          <p eId="para_12">On behalf of the committee I welcome Professor Gerry Boyle, director, Mr. Donal Carey, director of education and development, and Mr. Paddy Browne, assistant director of educational development, to discuss Teagasc's 2007 annual report.   Before making their presentation, I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that while members of the joint committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I call on Professor Boyle to make his presentation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_14">We have circulated copies of the presentation.  I thank the Chairman and his distinguished colleagues for the opportunity for us to discuss our education programmes in the agriculture and horticulture areas.  I will give a run down of what we doing in our educational programme.  My colleagues will answer questions and will amplify any matters members wish to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">We offer a diverse set of programmes.  We have eight colleges in the Teagasc network, four of which are owned by the us and the State and four of which are owned by private entities, although we subvent the programmes in those colleges to a substantial degree.  We also deliver educational programmes, largely on a part-time basis, through approximately 30 training networks throughout the country.  Many of the programmes are accredited and a substantial number are short courses of interest to the agricultural and rural community.  We have an extensive set of linkages with several other institutions, principally the institutes of technology, with which we have a close relationship in the delivery of many higher education programmes.  We also have connections with the Carmarthenshire College in Wales in the delivery of our e-college programme and we have extensive contacts with universities, especially University College Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Our courses divide into two categories.  The first is further education courses in agriculture delivered to students post-leaving certificate, which is the bread and butter of what we do, and these are broken down into students attending our colleges full time, part time, who are mainly mature students and farmers coming back for second chance education, and we deliver an extensive set of short courses on demand, responding to the needs of the day.  The second category is higher education programmes delivered through the institutes of technology to diploma level and level 7, which was formerly pass degree level.  We are also involved in the delivery through our contacts with the institutes of technology of level 8 or honours degree programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I refer to the colleges involved in the Teagasc network.  We deliver our full-time courses to students typically who would have completed the leaving certificate.  The first page contains the colleges in Teagasc ownership together with the professional and other staff located in them.  The largest college is Kildalton, Piltown, County Kilkenny, which covers a range of courses.  Then we have the Botanic Gardens and in conjunction with this, we have a facility at Kinsealy, County Dublin, which is also used in the delivery of education.  In recent years we established the innovative e-college, which, with few staff, is developing traction within the agriculture community.  The following page lists private colleges, which are not in Teagasc ownership.  Some of the staff are subvented by us and they are on the list.  The colleges are located at Gurteen, County Tipperary, Mountbellew, County Galway, Pallaskenry, County Limerick, and Warrenstown, County Meath.  The reference to other staff excludes farm staff funded by the colleges themselves because we do not benefit from the resources generated by the those farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">In addition to subvention of the staff, we also make capitation grants on a per student basis to the private colleges.  We have a diverse range of courses on offer, both in the colleges and also in the local centres throughout the country.  The mainstay and principal course is agricultural education.  We also deliver courses in horticulture, largely at our centre in the Botanic Gardens but also in Kildalton.  In recent years we have been delivering courses on horse-breeding and training in Kildalton and Gurteen.  We also deliver courses in forestry.  At our Ashtown and Moorepark food centres extensive training is delivered to the food industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I am sure the committee members are all familiar with the agricultural courses.  We cover levels 5 and 6, which are post-leaving certificate-type courses.  At the higher level we offer level 7 and level 8 courses, which is the honours degree level, in conjunction with the institutes of technology.  One of the features of these programmes which Teagasc has promoted from the outset and which has proved to be very popular with the agricultural students is the ability to progress through the ladder system of qualification.  We often find that students who may not have been too interested in academic matters find that in an agricultural college they are able to improve themselves and advance and then they want to progress to higher courses.  Our system enables this to happen quite effectively.  It has been one of the successes of the system in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">We offer horticultural courses from level 4 up to level 8, the honours degree level.  The levels above are just a few up to doctorate level.  We also offer a range of equine courses and these were very popular when the Celtic tiger was booming as it was an important recreational activity in the community and this was reflected in the uptake of these courses at Kildalton in particular and also at Gurteen college where a course is offered in conjunction with the Athlone Institute of Technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We offer a range of forestry courses.  We are involved in a progression to degree route with the Waterford Institute of Technology which has been a partner with Teagasc in the delivery of higher education courses since 2000, mainly in association with Kildalton.  We also offer a range of other courses.  I am pleased to say there is an insatiable demand in the agricultural community for a diversity of programmes.  The agricultural sector is a sector of the population with one of the greatest appetites for education and re-education and training.  This is reflected in the diversity of courses relating to agricultural mechanisation which is offered at our Pallaskenry college, in conjunction with the Limerick Institute of Technology.  We also offer courses in rural enterprise and agribusiness and in agriculture and environment which are offered in conjunction with our partner, GMIT, at our Mountbellew campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Adult and continuing education is a key part of what we deliver and there is high demand for these courses.  We offer the advanced certificate in agriculture as an on-line course as well as through college and part-time routes.  We have a range of courses and we can inform the committee about them if required.  We offer a range of short courses across the breadth of agriculture and food activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">We have a college network structure allied to a very effective local delivery system.  This is quite complex, as are the range of courses.  We also strive to improve and be innovative in what we offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">It is important for Teagasc as a public body to engage in a rigorous quality assurance programme.  I outlined in my presentation the key elements of such a system.  We have a quality assurance agreement with the assurance body for the further education sector, FETAC.  It applies a rigorous set of standards and protocols to both the establishment of courses in the first instance and it then monitors delivery of the courses.  Likewise at the higher education level, in collaboration with our colleagues in the institutes of technology, all our higher level courses are quality assured by HETAC which is the body charged with accreditation in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Teagasc has a rigorous programme of constant evaluation across all activities, including education and training.  These are cyclical evaluations of programmes.  We regularly review our programme.  We held a major review of the programme some years ago and also a review of our resources.  We have ongoing student evaluation of courses.  This allows us to make adjustments on a timely basis when needed in response to the needs of our students.  We also pay very close attention to the requirements of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">There is a good story to be told with regard to our enrolment trends although interpretation is always open to question.  I refer to trends in enrolments at our colleges, the eight colleges in the network.  Full-time students attending both further and higher education courses in 2008 number 755 students for further education.  This is a 40% increase on the previous year.  There had been a 33% increase on 2006.  We have an increase of more than 70% in numbers in further education relative to 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">There is somewhat less of an increase evident for the higher education trends but it is substantial at about 40% over the two years, 2007 and 2008.  We would be happy to discuss these numbers with the committee as to why the increase has occurred.  They are a very interesting and welcome turnaround.  No doubt, some of them are in response to the disimprovement in economic circumstances.  Many farmers would have worked part-time in the construction industry and education might have suffered in that situation.  This is one aspect.  On the other hand, in 2007, the remarkable turnaround in agricultural prices injected a much welcome mood of confidence in the sector and this was reflected partly in the increase in numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Apart from these numbers of enrolments in colleges, I refer to the substantial number of students who are what we term mature students.  The definition of a mature student in this context is anyone over 23 years of age.  These students would enrol on a part-time basis at our Teagasc centres around the country.  This year's enrolment of part-time students is 306, which is double the enrolment of the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">There has been a very welcome increase in numbers at both college level and at the local centres.  I refer to enrolments for adult and continuing education.  These are courses which are by and large not accredited.  They are short courses carried on in response to the demands from rural communities for courses in a diverse range of issues.  We have an extensive participation with 11,000 in 2007.  An additional 2,000 people are specifically trained in the food sector at our Ashtown food centre and also at our Moorepark centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I wish to draw the committee's attention to some future plans for the development of agricultural and horticultural education within Teagasc.  We are constantly reviewing our programmes in collaboration with our stakeholders.  We are very pleased to say we are well advanced in discussions with University College Dublin for the delivery of a degree programme in dairy management with a unique focus on business.  The programme is centred on the acquisition of management skills as far as modern dairy farming is concerned while being closely aligned with the business skills that are an essential feature of running a modern dairy farm.  Part of that programme will involve significant placement abroad in New Zealand.  There will also be extensive involvement by students in the dairy research programme conducted by Teagasc in Moorepark.  The structure of this degree programme came about following consultation with our stakeholders and in collaboration with UCD.  We are happy to report that considerable progress has been made on developing what I believe will be an innovative offering in the Irish educational sector at degree level.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">We have also embarked on a pilot leadership training programme in association with Macra na Feirme.  This has been piloted at the Gurteen campus.  Resources permitting, our intention is to roll out this programme throughout the other campuses.  We also intend to integrate very closely other activities.  A criticism that has been made of our educational programme in the past is that students do not get sufficient exposure to the path-breaking research undertaken throughout the Teagasc system and also that students do not get sufficient access to our advisory services, especially our specialist advisory services.  We are taking very deliberate action to improve that situation in the future.  We are considering the development of outreach centres and are considering the establishment of a FETAC common awards system.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I thank Professor Boyle.  Unfortunately we will need to suspend for a vote in the Dáil.  Given that Deputy Creed needs to leave, I call him to ask his questions briefly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I apologise that I will not be able to return after the suspension.  However, I will be able to read the responses in the record subsequently.  Teagasc's education programme is impressive and the enrolment increase may be as a result of many factors, including perhaps the decline in construction and people going back to education.  One of the main attractions of that was the installation aid programme.  Will the suspension of that scheme have a consequence for Teagasc's enrolment?  People might have had an expectation that as a consequence of having this qualification they would have had that entitlement.  Was there any consultation with Teagasc in advance of that decision?</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I note Teagasc's involvement up to degree level in some of the courses.  I was recently in contact with a person with a bachelor of agriculture qualification who was taking over a family farm.  He found that although he was qualified to deliver these courses on Teagasc's behalf, he was not qualified for a green certificate because of the modules he had followed in college.  That matter needs to be brought to the attention of students who may be considering pursuing a bachelor of agriculture degree but also want to take over a family farm subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Along with Deputy Doyle I recently visited a very impressive horticulture centre in north County Dublin.  I am sure the proprietor would not mind me mentioning the name -Tully Nurseries.  It was an exceptionally impressive place at least to the untrained eye.  He made the point that he found it very difficult to get qualified people in that industry and was giving employment to managers coming in from the UK.  He made the point that there is tremendous opportunity in that sector for exports and for import substitution, which should be given consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Professor Boyle did not mention the green economy in his presentation.  I look forward to hearing about it in the conference in Dublin Castle because it is a key policy area now.  I am concerned that we may be attempting to reinvent the wheel rather than take best practice from international examples.  I would be interested to hear Teagasc's observations on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">On a local level — all politics is local — there are some concerns over Teagasc's long-term commitment to the advisory centre in Dunmanway which services many of my constituents south of Macroom.  I seek some assurances on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I apologise that I have another meeting and will be unable to return.  I welcome Professor Boyle and his colleagues.  I am sure we will have further engagement in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_40">I welcome the representatives of Teagasc.  When we think about Teagasc which has a presence in many communities, there is a sense of positivity about its multifaceted work in areas such as education, research and consultancy.  While I acknowledge that its educational role is increasing, I wonder if the courses mentioned in the presentation would be so popular if the boom in the construction industry was ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I would like to go off on a tangent by discussing the potential of the agriculture sector for the economy of rural Ireland, with particular reference to research.  Will the representatives of Teagasc give us details of the cutting-edge research being conducted in the agriculture and rural economy sectors?  The agriculture sector has a major opportunity to diversify into the production of energy from sources such as methane.  I will not refer to it as alternative energy production because it is about to become mainstream.  I ask the delegates to outline what Teagasc is doing in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">It would not be a bad idea for members of the committee to visit some of the Teagasc sites where research is taking place to obtain more information on its research function.  People in my local area are very proud of the work that takes place at the Moorepark research centre in the heart of my constituency.  While it may be a cliché to refer to it as the jewel in the crown of the east Cork region, we are proud of the centre and the research done there.  Without being too parochial, what does the future hold for centres such as Moorepark and local offices like the one in Mallow?  I understand the provision made for Teagasc in the 2009 budget represents a decrease of approximately 8%.  What impact will the decrease, from €132 million to €122 million, have on the delivery of services?  Will the delegates give us some feedback?</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I can inform the Deputy that the agriculture committee of the previous Dáil visited the Moorepark facility in County Cork.  We also visited the Grange facility in County Meath on numerous occasions.  Teagasc officials in Grange were always very good to us.  When overseas delegations came to visit the committee, we usually took them to Grange.  They were shown around the place before being wined and dined.  I thank Teagasc for this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PJSheenan" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I welcome the representatives of Teagasc.  I am proud to have been associated with Teagasc since its foundation as the various committees of agriculture.  I was first introduced to the committees in March 1962.  During the years they played an important role in giving our young farmers and domestic economy teachers a solid and sound foundation.  They merged to form An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, ACOT, now known as Teagasc.  I have been involved in three periods of advancement in agriculture, from the committees of agriculture to ACOT to Teagasc.  From the outset, the staff of the committees of agriculture were dedicated to the advancement of agriculture.  The committees were empowered to appoint people every month to temporary posts as agricultural instructors and domestic economy teachers and other posts associated with agriculture.  It was a very worthwhile business for those concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">At the time we operated a sea sand subsidy scheme to improve the quality of the soil in rural areas adjacent to the coastline.  The scheme in question replaced the lime subsidy scheme.  The use of sea sand rather than lime was encouraged on the Mizen Peninsula because the nearest lime kilns were almost 60 miles away.  This useful ingredient which included seaweed as well as sea sand helped to improve the quality of the soil.  However, the powers that be later ruled it out completely because they did not think its use was nature-friendly.  I continue to doubt whether that is the case.  Nothing is being done to clear the sea sand that is building up in our lakes and river estuaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Be that as it may, I was very impressed by the presentation made by Teagasc.  I was interested to hear the delegation's remarks about enrolment trends at agriculture colleges during the five-year period 2004 to 2008.  When one considers that the number of students in such colleges increased from 738 in 2004, 682 in 2005, 618 in 2006 and 774 in 2007 to 1,049 in 2008, it is clear that there has been a dramatic increase in enrolment levels in recent times.  The trend associated with the building boom of the last five years, when young farmers were able to make quick money by going into the building trade, has been reversed.  It was an outstanding achievement on the part of Teagasc to maintain the <i>status quo</i> during the boom before increasing student numbers to 1,049 this year.  It is a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">It should not be forgotten that when the last litre of gas is drawn from the Celtic Sea and the Porcupine Basin off the coast of County Mayo, agriculture will still be playing a predominant role in the economy.  This country has just three natural industries — agriculture, fishing and tourism.  The fishing industry has almost been obliterated and tourism is a dying trend.  Agriculture is the only natural industry we will have left.  It is of paramount importance that all our efforts focus on building a sound and successful agricultural economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">As I said, Teagasc is an outstanding body which has served the country very well.  It has improved farming conditions the length and breadth of the country. I have no doubt, given the organisation's record, that it will continue to perform this role.  I wish it well in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Major strides have been made in the 46 years since I became involved in agricultural bodies.  At that time, there were no modern piggeries or cow units and farms were run using obsolete working methods.  The position has changed for the betterment of the country thanks to the former committees of agriculture, which pioneered the way forward, and Teagasc, which has perfected it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_52">Is Teagasc's annual budget €150 million?  How many staff are in the organisation?  The increase in the take-up of courses from last year to this year was minimal yet there were increases of 50% in further education courses and 30% in higher level courses in the previous five years.  How does Teagasc see that trend going?  Will there be a fall-off or an increase in course take-up, particularly with the downturn in the construction industry?  I know of several people who were working as part-time farmers but, with the construction industry downturn, they are returning to full-time farming.  They see it as the only secure employment option for them rather than being forced to emigrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I am surprised at the figure of €150 million for Teagasc's annual budget.  It seems quite substantial for the service being provided.  I am not calling into question the quality of the service provided.  However, when we look at the number of full-time farmers today as opposed to ten years ago, we see that many have left farming.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_54">I thank Professor Boyle and his colleagues.  I was going to raise the point made by Deputy Creed about the nurseries and the courses to which that gentleman and his son alluded.  Is there any provision in the network either in Warrenstown College or the Botanic Gardens?</p>
          <p eId="para_55">I am the product of the old agricultural college apprenticeship, and I am delighted to say that I have a son studying agricultural science in UCD.  That has changed a great deal since the time one of my brothers studied it.  It is certainly more focused.  Professor Boyle made the point about evolution in training and research, and how that works its way down to operational level on the farm.  He made the point that lead colleges are not linked to Teagasc's research and advisory services.  Has he got the wherewithal within the current structure of Teagasc to get that information down to ground level?  The organisation's goals are perfectly sane and sensible.  I made the point the last day about the use of GM technology.  Is Teagasc listened to by people who form Government policy and who negotiate in Europe on our behalf?</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_57">I have one question.  I am sure the same research facilities are operating in Grange.  It is a while since we were there, so maybe next year we can visit.  Grange is so important, particularly for the beef industry, and it has done great work over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">As we all know, Warrenstown College unfortunately will close down.  It provided great service over the years, and in recent times it concentrated on horticulture.  There are many good farmers who went through Warrenstown and it is an awful pity that we in County Meath are parting company with it.  One of my first trips as a member of the county agricultural committee was a trip to Warrenstown in 1974.  Deputy P. J. Sheehan was there 12 years before me.  I also went to Grange at that time as well.  It did tremendous work over the years, and it is so sad that it will go.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Are the seven professional staff also members of Teagasc?  Are the other 14 privately part of the college?  The enrolment trends are very welcome.  Everybody was concerned that many younger people would go for the big money during the boom times, and I suppose we could not blame them.  With agriculture taking a turn for the better, it is great to see that enrolment has increased substantially.  Adult education has increased as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_60">I will deal with as many questions as I can, and will ask my colleagues to come in where appropriate.  Deputy Creed asked a question about installation aid and the extent to which that might affect enrolment.  He also asked whether we were consulted.  The decisions on installation are entirely a matter for the Government, and we had not hand, act or part in consultation for installation aid.  We are conscious that policy can influence decision making on enrolment, and there is no doubt that the installation aid issue will have an influence.  Other factors will also affect people's decisions, but policy is one of them.  A welcome development has been the extension of the stamp duty exemption for another few years, because that is a very important part in encouraging people here to participate in agricultural education.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Deputy Creed also asked a question about the difficulty some students with a degree in agricultural science have in obtaining entitlement to an exemption from stamp duty relief, when they have not taken certain modules as part of that degree.  This is a matter entirely for University College Dublin, which determines the suitability of modules or otherwise.  We are advised by UCD, but we are keeping the matter under constant review.  Ultimately, it is within the purview of UCD as to the appropriateness of the degree and the individual modules within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">A question was raised by Deputy Doyle and Deputy Creed about the type of horticultural education programme we have on offer at our colleges.  I will ask my colleagues to speak about that in a moment.  It has been a very popular degree in recent years.  The emphasis has shifted from production horticulture to amenity horticulture.  This has been a function of the performance of the economy.  When the housing sector was buoyant, there was significant demand for the services of amenity horticulturists and college enrolment benefited on foot of that.  The programme has been adapted over the years at Botanic Gardens, Warrenstown and Kildalton to respond to that need.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Deputy Creed and Deputy Sherlock raised issues about the promotion of the green economy and sustainability in general.  This is part of our educational programmes and is something we are continuously monitoring to make sure students are conscious of sustainability.  That covers all agricultural practices at this stage.  Students must be alert to sustainability issues.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_64">On a point of order, I understand what Professor Boyle is saying about awareness and sustainability, but we would take that as a given.  I am specifically asking about research projects on methane and the greening of agriculture.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_65">Excuse me.  I was trying to deal with Deputy Creed's comment and I will come to Deputy Sherlock's question shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">A query was raised about the Dunmanway and Mallow offices.  Teagasc is at present reviewing its entire office network.  We service 88 offices throughout the country.  In the present difficulties, which I will deal with shortly in regard to our budget situation, we must obviously consider how efficiently we deliver our services.  All of our offices are being carefully examined but it would be premature at this stage to comment on any individual office because we have to consider the totality, which is where we are at present.  We are actively looking at that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Moving on to Deputy Sherlock's comments, I appreciate the positive remarks he made about our service, which are welcome.  The Deputy made a number of important points with which we would totally agree.  We published a report last May, entitled Teagasc 2030 Foresight, in which we argued that agriculture is on the cusp of profound change.  If we consider global trends, there has been a structural shift in the demand for food versus the supply of food.  Given the current situation, it is of course understandable that people would focus on the very real difficulties we are experiencing, not just in the pigmeat sector in recent days but also what has been happening in dairying in the past year, particularly with regard to input prices.  However, if we consider the medium term, all of the indicators are that a structural change has taken place from a position where we were facing a structural oversupply of food in terms of the tendency for supply to constantly outstrip demand.  We are now heading into the reverse position, which seems to be the assessment of authoritative commentators on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">This provides a huge opportunity for agriculture on that front alone but it also provides an opportunity on the energy front.  We all know we are heading rapidly towards peak oil so there is a very real issue concerning the structural shortage in energy.  This is where renewables, particularly bio-renewables, enter as a key strategic issue for us nationally, which obviously has major implications for research.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Teagasc has invested substantial additional resources in recent years in examining the whole area of renewables at Oak Park Research Centre, Carlow.  I do not know whether the committee has visited the centre but if it is specifically interested in getting a briefing on the whole renewables area, that would be the centre to visit.  We are doing work on the production side in terms of considering the productivity of different renewable crops such as miscanthus, willow and so forth, and all that one would expect Teagasc to be doing.  However, we feel the next move has to come on the processing side.  If we want to be a significant player in producing biofuels in the years ahead, we need to have a research facility that is testing the processing of those biofuels.  Even with first generation technology, it is important to be in there now to acquaint ourselves with the logistics involved, which are substantial, and to access the raw biomass.  If we are in there now with first generation technologies, when the new technologies — the so-called second and third generation technologies — come on board, we will then be in a position to lever off that knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">We have been working with colleagues in other educational institutions in putting together a series of proposals that would involve developing a pilot plant processing facility to enable this to happen.  We are very excited about this prospect and have been working with Enterprise Ireland and other agencies to try to convince them of the need for this to happen.  Of course, the financial climate has changed in recent times and there may not be the same enthusiasm about a project like this.  However, we are pushing it because we believe a test plant facility would enable the processing industry in the biofuels area in particular to take off.  We would like to model this facility on what we have done at Moorepark in regard to the dairy processing sector with a similar type of initiative on fuel processing and bio-processing.  It is a project we are strongly supporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">On methane, we attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security a couple of weeks ago at which Deputy Doyle and perhaps some other members of this committee were present.  We pointed out to that committee the huge challenges that are presented to Ireland specifically.  The only other country in the world with the same challenges in regard to methane gases is New Zealand, which is considerably ahead of us in terms of the research resources it has devoted to this area.  We would estimate it has probably been spending at about ten times the level we have been spending in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">In a nutshell, the difficulty is a simple one.  Some 50% of the problem of greenhouse gases in agriculture is due to what is called enteric fermentation, which is the fermentation which takes place within ruminant animals such as cattle and dairy cows.  There is little that can be done scientifically to reduce emissions from that source and it is a challenge with which scientists have been presented worldwide.  In so far as we can given our resources, we are linked into that research.  We are making substantial progress in some areas.  The other half of the research on emissions relates to the uses of slurries, regarding which we have substantially advanced our knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Work is ongoing at Johnstown Castle, where environmental and nutrient management has demonstrated very clearly that it makes sense for the farmer's pocket to conserve on the purchase of chemical fertilisers but it also makes environmental sense.  The message we have been constantly selling to farmers is that one can have win-win outcomes — win for the environment, win for the farmer.  We have made substantial progress in recent years in pointing out to farmers that they can make significant efficiency gains by conserving on chemical fertiliser use.  If we consider the trend in nitrogen and phosphorous use in recent years, there has been a significant decline in usage by farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Recent years have been a very good example of how economics drive consumption and usage.  It is an area where we can report progress but we must admit that enteric fermentation remains a fundamental research challenge and the only way we can make progress is by aligning ourselves with international best practice in this area.  This will require significant additional resources and, in so far as we can do so given the limited resources available to us, we are pushing resources in that direction.  We have of course drawn the attention of Government to the huge challenge in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">We are very happy to invite the Chairman and the committee to visit any centre they would care to visit but perhaps the committee would be particularly interested in following up on the ideas in the newer areas of renewables and methane mitigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">With regard to our 2009 budget, with other State agencies we have had a significant reduction in our grant-in-aid.  We generate resources other than grant-in-aid from farmer contributions by way of charges for advisory services and we also generate external income through our research colleagues winning external contracts from the State — for example, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food runs a number of competitive research competitions of which we have won several.  We also participate actively in international competitions and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Obviously, our grant-in-aid is crucial but it has been reduced by approximately €10 million for next year, which represents a 10% reduction when one takes out the pensions contribution.  As one can imagine, this will have severe implications for our ability to deliver a wide range of services to our farmer and food industry clients.  In fact, our view is that unless we can get a voluntary early retirement scheme in place to enable us to save on payroll costs, our operational budgets will be severely impaired to the point that in many cases we will not be able to deliver the same level of service which we have been delivering.  We have been arguing very strongly that if we wish to maintain our services intact, and given the challenges in the rapidly changing environmental research area, there is a need to constantly upgrade our staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Increasingly, we are recruiting biochemists, biotechnologists, soil microbiologists and so on.  An entirely new recruitment pattern must be put in place because of the rapidly shifting nature of the international science platform and capabilities.  This represents a dramatic turnaround from our traditional recruitment pattern.  If we are to keep up to date with research, we must have some headroom to recruit, even in a difficult economic climate.  The budget situation is a serious concern for us and we hope to convince the Government that a voluntary early retirement scheme must be part and parcel of the necessary budgetary adjustments.  That is vital in terms of the delivery of our front line services.  There is an ongoing dialogue in this regard, which is tied up with the wider issue of public sector reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Like Deputy Sheehan, I acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by the county committees of agriculture for many years.  Their involvement with local communities is well recognised and their attachment to local areas particularly valued.  We have taken this model on board in setting up our new area management units, and our advisory service is particularly conscious of the need to maintain contact with local communities.  I am pleased to note Deputy Sheehan's long association with Teagasc.  Members may be aware that it is the 50th anniversary of the establishment of An Foras Talúntais, the forerunner of Teagasc.  Deputy Sheehan has been involved for most of that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I will follow up on the Deputy's remarks on the sea-sand subsidy.  I am not aware of the details of this.  A colleague of mine used to say that if one keeps wearing the same suit, one will sooner or later come into fashion.  Soils were very much in fashion in the early 1960s, went out of fashion for a time and are now returning into focus, with particular reference to the environmental challenges we are facing.  It is an area in which we have invested significant resources given that it is a key issue in terms of understanding the pathways of pollution in the agricultural area.  The late Tom Walsh, the first director of An Foras Talúntais, had a firm understanding of the importance of soil to productivity.  We now recognise that understanding soils is also important in terms of pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">In regard to education, we take some credit for our efforts in providing attractive programmes for farmers.  However, the reality is that it is farmers themselves who make the decisions in terms of education.  It is parents who decide to send their children to agricultural college having weighed up the costs attached to doing so.  During the Celtic tiger years, the main cost was the foregone opportunity to earn a good wage from the farm.  It is a significant commitment to give that up for several years.  The farm business may also be affected by that type of decision.  Ultimately, however, farmers will engage with education if there are benefits for them in so doing.  This is an area we have examined carefully.  All our research shows that the educated farmer is a better farmer, with enhanced productivity and income.  It is a message we are constantly putting out.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Several questions were asked about the scale of our budget and the value for money it represents.  This is a very broad issue but I will try to deal with it succinctly.  As at June 2007, our full-time permanent staff establishment was some 1,400 across the entire organisation.  Under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, which established Teagasc, we are statutorily charged to provide three distinct sets of services to the agriculture and food sector, namely, research, advisory, and education and training.  The staff complement of 1,400 refers to the entire breadth of our services.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">In addition, we have some 200 contract staff, the vast majority of whom are self-funded.  In the advisory area, for example, we operate a successful REPS service.  All the contract staff engaged in this scheme must pay for themselves, otherwise we cannot hire them.  We also engage a significant number of contract staff through our research programme.  Typically, when one bids for an external research contract, one must employ somebody to carry out the work under supervision and that is funded also.  In terms of the educational staff, including the support staff who are a critically important part of the system, we have 233 staff across the system.  This includes both Teagasc colleges and those staff subvented in our private colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The grant-in-aid, which is the public element, is some €122 million, including the pensions contribution.  We can demonstrate substantial value for money in our management of this funding.  Before I took on this position many years ago, I wrote a book on the returns to agricultural research.  For example, potato breeding work has been under way in Oak Park for several years, and we have produced internationally best selling varieties.  Members are familiar with the Rooster variety, which is produced by Harry Keogh, a former colleague of ours.  We receive royalties for that and the returns to Irish farmers year in and year out have been substantial.  We have quantified all these issues.  I can point to many successes in our work with the food industry.  The outstanding one is the Dubliner cheese produced by Carbery Milk Products Limited which was substantially assisted in its introduction by Moorepark.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Of particular note are the returns to public research.  Everything we do is published and available for all the industry to take up.  The returns have been substantial.  My estimate is that, on average, for every €1 million spent on public agricultural and food research, one could expect up to 40% of that as an internal rate of return.  We are happy to stand over that type of evidence.  We would like to be able to convince the Government of this more than we have done, but we will keep plugging at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">We are confident that we are delivering value for money but are not complacent.  I will not deny there are areas in which we could effect greater efficiencies.  That is what we are trying to do and will continue to do.  We have demonstrated that there are returns to education.  As I said, an educated farmer is a more productive farmer.  There are also returns to intensive advisory input.  All of this is quantifiable and the return is undeniable.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">In regard to pensions, the liability is certainly substantial.  We operate a "pay as you go" system in the same way as the public sector generally and the Civil Service.  Teagasc has been in operation for a long time, which helps to explain the size of the pensions liability.  We have approximately the same number of pensioners as we have permanent staff.  Clearly, the expectation is that this entitlement will be honoured into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I have tried to deal with the issues raised as comprehensively as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">In regard to the research function, I understand Professor Boyle's point about the return.  In terms of scientific proposals that are made, I understand Teagasc tenders for external research and that the Department has a tendering process in this regard.  In terms of the internal research function, the proposals made and the internal returns, as a lay man I wonder how many proposals will come forward to Teagasc on an annual basis, internally, and how many Teagasc makes returns on in terms of viability economically or in respect of a contribution to other components in the scientific community.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">From a geopolitical perspective, methane is coming on the agenda and there will be a global move to reduce herd numbers.  The basis of that will be the production of methane.  The scientific community must come up with something or the alternative will be to reduce herd numbers.  I am not proposing that we reduce herd numbers but I wonder where the scientific community is in respect or this.  The delegation stated that research is taking place in Oak Park, though I thought it was at Grange.  I am trying to ascertain whether we are ahead of, on or behind the curve in terms of where science is.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Is there an appetite for take-up of the voluntary retirement scheme or has it been finalised?</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Regarding operating expenses, I note expenditure of €2.4 million for postage and telephones in 2007.  Fuel and petrol amounts to €2.1 million.  I understand Teagasc has 1,400 employees and it is an expensive spend.  How does Teagasc gain efficiency in respect of the service providers for telephones?  Does it tender on an annual basis?  Is it practical to do so?  Can the delegation give us an idea of how Teagasc operates from that perspective?</p>

          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_93">There is an extensive internal process in respect of the prioritisation of research projects.  It is a major challenge.  There are so many bright people there and we must assign them to priority areas.  We work from our overall three year strategy.  One simple objective is to support competitiveness of agriculture and food, another is to support sustainable agriculture and the third is to support rural development.  We allocate our projects depending on how they fit into these three categories.  The primary area in terms of the bulk of our projects is competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">I should have clarified what I meant by methane research.  Oak Park is concerned with renewables work and particularly work on crops.  Methane research is led by Johnstown Castle, the premier environmental research centre.  We work closely with animal production centres in Moorepark for obvious reasons, and with Grange.  It is a programme-led approach.  The major challenge with regard to methane research is in respect of enteric fermentation.  We had a major conference last year and the results are published on our website.  A New Zealand expert attended.  That country has been investing in the area for a long time.  It is a difficult, challenging area.  We hope to plug into that research.  We do have not have the resources in that area to claim we are international leaders.  We see our best way forward in collaboration with New Zealand.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Scientists get overly excited about something that appears to provide a magic bullet solution.  One exciting area is a vaccine that is being developed in New Zealand and Australia, which might ultimately tackle the mystery of the rumine.  We are watching that.  We are conscious of the need to allocate additional resources into this area for the strategic reasons to which the Deputy refers.  None of us in the agriculture sector wants to see the catastrophic solution of culling the national herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Operating expenses are significant.  We are located at 88 centres around the country.  The job of an advisor is to maintain constant contact with farm families.  The advisors are on the road constantly.  Farmers expect and want that.  There is no point in having the advisor tied up in an office.  I am conscious that is costly.  We have been examining this to minimise the expense as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">I am setting up a centralised procurement system, which will go some way to dealing with some of the issues raised.  We are examining all our major suppliers in the telecom and postage area.  We must minimise our operational budgets here.  We are considering using video conferencing technology, which is available throughout the system.  The Deputy is correct in identifying this.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The problem we are now presented with is that over 80% of our budget is spent on staff.  When our grant-in-aid is reduced by €10 million or 10% the burden of adjustment must fall on the operating side.  We must effect economies to enable us to deliver our service.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Mr. Donal Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_99">There was a question raised about enrolment next year.  Our open days and inquiries have increased and we are optimistic we can maintain the current trend.  We had a 37% increase last year built on a 25% increase the year before.  I do not expect the curve to keep going straight up but we are positive that we can maintain the current gains and maybe increase them.  This reflects the downturn but also the positive outlook for dairy.  That might be slightly thwarted at the moment but farmers are pragmatic and look to the long term.  It also reflects the root and branch examination we had of our programme content.  We had extensive discussions with a huge network of stakeholders.  This included interviewing farmers, farm organisations and anyone connected with the business.  It was a massive undertaking.  We listened carefully and implemented all the recommendations.  Of 42 recommendations, 41 have been implemented.  The depth and range of our courses reflect the needs of people.  Those coming into our courses have the choice of attending an agricultural college or attending locally or doing it through our e-college.  There is great flexibility.  We are proud that we have an outreach.  People do not travel in agricultural education.  If one is in Mayo, one is not likely to go to Kildalton college to attend a course.  Some people will travel, but in general one must have an outreach centre.  Our outreach centres are working very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">We are using the full facilities in Teagasc.  Our colleges have integrated with research colleagues.  Ballyhaise is connected to Moorepark.  A number of research projects are ongoing.  Deputy Brady is aware that we were always criticised because the Meath and Cavan dairy farmers could not relate to Moorepark because they were three weeks behind in terms of grass growth.  We have extensive trials in Ballyhaise.  Commercial farmers have been in there and, in the past two or three years, they have been impressed with the research under way.  Not alone do we have an agriculture college, we have applied research under way.  We are playing to our strengths.  We are optimistic about that.  Mr. Browne will answer the question on horticulture.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">Deputies Doyle and Creed referred to a nursery, which is an excellent location.  We use it extensively for student placements.  Regarding the question on the shortage of qualified managers, since we went into third level involvement with Waterford IT and Blanchardstown IT we are producing more graduates at ordinary degree level.  This is specifically designed for management of a situation like this.  Perhaps it is at the expense of operatives.  The operatives situation has been met in the past few years by immigrant workers.  We do not know where this will go.  We do not anticipate a shortage at management level.  If a shortage has occurred in recent years it is probably because many people went into self-employment because of the boom.  We do not see this as an issue in the coming years.</p>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_103">At a meeting on the climate I raised the issue of emissions.  It seems to be accepted that Ireland must do something about its methane emissions.  However, we do not have an international assessment table and it should not be taken that we must take drastic measures.  New Zealand uses a different method to the one we use.  It is critical that we hold to the point that until we establish a common system of calculation of what a unit of food costs in carbon emissions we should not decide to reduce our dairy herd because it is responsible for such a high percentage of our national emissions and allow in product from a less efficient source of production.  Other reasons for emissions also exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Prior to my arrival at this meeting, did the committee discuss the conference to be held in January?</p>
        </speech>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_25">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_106">It is worth attending because a great deal of discussion will take place on this matter.  However, I am concerned that we must act.  We have acted but we should not accept that we are inefficient.  From a broad figure on tonnages I believe we are far more efficient than the EU average.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_107">On this point, Deputy Doyle is correct.  If emissions are expressed per tonne of output of product we are extremely efficient and we are far more efficient than countries in Latin America which would be the beneficiaries if we were to reduce our cattle herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Chairman raised a question about Warrenstown which I wish to address.  I endorse the comments on the outstanding contribution made through the years by the Salesian order and the staff at Warrenstown in agriculture and horticulture education.  I assure the committee that as far as the closure of Warrenstown is concerned and the absorption of the staff at Warrenstown into the Botanic Gardens and Kinsealy, the commitment to the horticultural industry will be maintained and enhanced under the new arrangements.  I reassure the committee that we are taking every care to ensure the students and staff affected by this movement are facilitated.  Teagasc has always been sensitive to the real issues affecting people there and we have this in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">A question was raised on the staff subvented by Teagasc.  The private college staff we present in our handout are all funded by Teagasc.  Other staff were engaged directly by the Salesians who are funded by them.  Technically these are not Teagasc employees but for all practical purposes we treat them as such.  Therefore, in the arrangements we must put in place to move the staff and students to the Botanic Gardens and Kinsealy we are treating them as if they were fully engaged by Teagasc.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">With regard to Grange, it is a major centre in the beef industry.  We will establish a demonstration farm there in the near future to demonstrate to farmers the benefits of research in suckler beef systems.  We also established a better farm programme in association with the <i>Irish Farmers’ Journal</i>, which involves an intensive advisory and research commitment to target a number of beef farms throughout the country.  We have placed two dedicated full-time advisers on this to help increase the level of productivity in the beef sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Recently, at the Grange centre we established an animal bio-science facility which is the new wave of research in bio-sciences.  We have already built up a strong dynamic unit of young researchers who will be the researchers of the future, particularly with regard to upgrading the genetic quality of our beef herd, which is a key objective.</p>

This committee hopes to visit some of the research centres during the coming year.  We were extremely impressed when we visited Grange and Moorepark over the years and we look forward to visiting Teagasc again.</p>
