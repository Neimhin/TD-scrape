          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_3">Before I put my question to the Taoiseach, which I have no doubt he will answer in full with a fully amplified answer, I wish him and his the very best for the future, whatever that might bring.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> There has been major disruption at Dublin Airport over the past of couple of days. Flights in and out of the airport have been cancelled or delayed and people's travel plans have been thrown into chaos. Some were booked onto later flights, many had to make alternative arrangements and others faced the prospect of booking expensive accommodation they had not budgeted for. Airport users have told stories of being sent from pillar to post when seeking information following the cancellation of their flights and there has been serious frustration, confusion and a sense of "Here we go again". I appreciate that a spell of extreme cold weather presents challenges, and I also accept there have been some knock-on effects from disruption at other airports. However, we cannot shy away from the fact that once again, there has been a real failure to prepare at Dublin Airport and there has not been a word from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, or from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">It seems the lessons of the summer have gone unlearned.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> We have a right to expect that part of the contingency planning for wintertime at a major European airport would be a plan to keep flights going during a cold snap, yet it seems planning for the de-icing of aircraft and runways was only an afterthought, as management was taken by surprise. Once again, we see authorities scrambling around rather than being prepared for a scenario that was entirely foreseeable and we have been here before. In the summer, the failure to plan at Dublin Airport brought chaos and the situation, as the Taoiseach will recall, spiralled out of control because the Minister for Transport failed to get to grips with the crisis. Now it seems the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is asleep at the wheel again.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Christmas is the busiest time of the year at Dublin Airport. Approximately 1 million people will pass through the airport during the holidays. It is a time when people reconnect, when many of our young people who have emigrated will return home to their families and friends, and the only scenes we should see at Dublin Airport at Christmastime are scenes of joy, happiness and reconnection. We cannot have a return to the mayhem that enveloped the airport during the summer. It is the responsibility of the Government, and the Minister in particular, to ensure all preparations are made. Ours is a small, island nation; we rely heavily on our airports to ensure our connectivity with the rest of the world. Along with the personal distress, episodes of significant disruption damage Ireland’s international reputation for business and investment. That is the reality. The Minister must wake up and do his job to ensure Dublin Airport runs properly. We cannot afford more chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> Tá an cur isteach mór atá ag tarlú ag Aerfort Bhaile Átha Cliath doghlactha. Tá an tAire Iompair, an Teachta Eamon Ryan, ina chodladh arís. Caithfidh sé a chuid oibre a dhéanamh agus a chinntiú nach mbeidh cíorthuathail againn san aerfort i rith na Nollag. The Government must step forward and be proactive. There has to be a plan for this. Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister about the current disruption at Dublin Airport? Has he instructed the Minister to intervene immediately in order that we do not have a return to travel chaos at Dublin Airport this Christmas?</p>

          <p eId="para_9">First of all, I thank the Deputy for her initial comments and her “this is it” approach. I thought there was an Elvis Presley moment coming on me there, like in his song "I Miss You" or whatever.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_5">

          <p eId="para_10">In the first instance, the national emergency co-ordination group has been meeting in response to the severe weather situation. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. We are experiencing a period of extremely cold weather. It has settled over Ireland, with severe frost, freezing fog, ice, wintry showers and the fall of snow. The national directorate for fire and emergency management crisis management team has been meeting daily since Friday, 2 December, liaising closely with Met Éireann, and the national emergency co-ordination group was convened and has been meeting daily since Sunday to assess the national and local preparedness in light of the forecast prolonged period of extreme cold weather. The group will continue to meet for the duration of this weather event.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who is sitting here beside me, was at that meeting on Sunday. He is wide awake and was wide awake throughout the weekend in respect of this issue. In particular, he met representatives of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA. Issues with the DAA that the Deputy raised do need to be followed through with the authority. We need to make sure that capacity exists within the Dublin Airport Authority in terms of de-icing and preparing for extreme weather events to make sure that key connectivity through aviation is maintained. State agencies are established by law, they are resourced and people are appointed to senior positions. There is an obligation on the agencies to be prepared and respond to situations such as this. That said, Dublin Airport is not the only airport that has had challenges through this period. Manchester Airport has had challenges and Heathrow Airport has had significant challenges, some of which have spilled over to Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">More broadly across the transport sector, the local authority severe weather assessment teams are monitoring the situation and co-ordinating responses. Winter plans are now in operation. Widespread gritting has happened and will continue. Transport Infrastructure Ireland is also involved. Sufficient salt is available across the country to facilitate work particularly on our more dangerous minor roads. We urge the public to be very careful when travelling on our roads in these dangerous times.

I accept that the Dublin Airport Authority and the airlines have a case to answer here, but ultimately public confidence will only be built if there is a sense that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, actually has a plan. I accept that others have met and made contingency arrangements during a snap of very hard cold weather. This close to Christmas with so many people coming home we need public reassurance that the Minister is fully engaged. I ask the Taoiseach to give more detail of that. He said there was a meeting with the Dublin Airport Authority. What was the upshot of that? It is not the only airport on the island, but it is the key hub airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">At the risk of another Elvis moment, I wish the Taoiseach well in our last engagement on Leaders' Questions. I wish him well in whatever his future role may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The Taoiseach may wish to indicate at this point in what role he will be returning to the Dáil in the new year. Suspicious minds - Members can see what I did there - are suggesting that it will be in a new role as Minister for Foreign Affairs but the Taoiseach may wish to confirm or deny that on the floor of the Chamber. Elvis has left the building now. </p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On a serious note, the Taoiseach has been assuring us that his Ministers have been wide awake and not asleep at the wheel. It certainly appears that the officials of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have been having some sleepless nights rushing through the drafting of the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022, which will be rushed through this House through all Stages this week. On 1 December, the Labour Party wrote to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, expressing our concern at the rushed-through nature of this planning law. The Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is, as we have said, and through our colleague, Senator Moynihan, the latest in a long line of housing, residential and planning Bills that have been sought to be passed into law at the last minute before either a summer or Christmas recess. While we completely support measures which might see the acceleration of delivery of housing, our concern is that this Bill will not see the delivery of homes, which is so badly needed, and will not deliver the much-needed planning reforms. More importantly, it will not expedite the actual delivery of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Last week I raised the fact that there are 28,000 live planning permissions in the Dublin City Council area alone which have not been activated, which had gone through the planning process, but where we are seeing a delay in delivery. These undeveloped sites are fuelling high rates of homelessness, escalating rents and lengthening housing lists with more than 11,000 people now on the housing list. We also see the sort of substandard living conditions I have spoken about in my own constituency, where 27 tenants were recently evicted and were living in what was essentially a firetrap of a building.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Will the Taoiseach, the Government, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, take account of the warnings from its own agency, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, that there has been hoarding and speculative behaviour in which developers and investors are acquiring planning permissions to hold as an asset and engaging in what we have seen described as land banking or land hoarding. This is a key issue and obstacle to the actual delivery of homes across cities and towns across this country. We have seen this concern raised not only by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service but also by the ESRI in a report stating that State intervention is now needed to end land speculation and land hoarding and to see a speeded-up delivery of housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_35">In particular, we in the Labour Party introduced a Bill to enact the Kenny report, a report which if enacted - this report will be 50 years old next year - would have done a great deal to ensure an end to land hoarding. Will the Taoiseach speed up and see to the passage of our Kenny report Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_20">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T14:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">I thank the Deputy for her very kind comments in advance. I have good news for the Deputy in that today, at Government, we approved legislation relating to land value sharing, which deals fundamentally with the issue of excessive profits being made following the zoning of land. Given the level of public infrastructure and investment that takes place in the State on any land that is zoned for housing, a portion of that value must accrue to the State. This is very radical legislation and is Kenny-like in respect of the Kenny report of many decades ago. This legislation will be introduced and there is also a zoned land tax, which will be a further feature to deal with hoarding in respect of planning permissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> If the Deputy combines all of the measures that have been taken, a fairly radical approach is being taken now, both legislatively and policy-wise in respect of the utilisation of land, preventing land speculation and endeavouring over the medium term to get land pricing down, so as to get house prices down.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In parallel with that, we have an unprecedented investment in housing to the tune of €4 billion per annum. The legislation which the Deputy has referred to, which is minor but essential legislation in respect of interim measures for An Bord Pleanála, also has measures to deal with exempting from Part 8 the building of social and affordable homes on publicly owned local authority land to accelerate the planning process. I have been in this House for quite some months where people have been saying that this housing crisis is an emergency and that we need to act urgently. The Minister's amendment is designed to enable us to move quickly, particularly with rapid-build housing on local authority land for social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I do not see why anyone in the House could object to that, given that we need to increase the number of houses we build and build them more rapidly. That is the agenda. The Bill relates to the appointment of an interim chairperson of An Bord Pleanála, which is very important given what has happened in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> Across the board, there is now a range of schemes to deal with the housing crisis, including the Croí Cónaithe towns and cities scheme, the help to buy scheme and the first homes scheme. This year, there were 16,000 first-time buyers, the highest number since 2008. About 18,000 social homes have been built since 2020, the highest figure in a long time. This year we aim to get to 10,000 social houses, with 8,000 built, which is the highest number in many decades. We are building momentum but we have to go faster and do more. That is the objective of the legislation, namely, to give us the capacity to go faster and get more houses built more quickly so that young people who are looking for housing can get them it an affordable level.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">We will support any measures that will see the delivery of housing. However, the difficulty for many people is that they are not seeing that outcome. They are hearing the Government listing off plans in progress, preparation being made or issues that will deliver on momentum, but they are not actually seeing the delivery of affordable homes for themselves or their children, friends and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> This is now eating into many different areas of life. As we know, it is affecting the ability of schools to attract teachers and the ability of hospitals to attract nurses and doctors. It is affecting every small business across the country in their ability to attract staff. We are seeing a failure of Government to deliver on outcomes. That is the key issue in housing. When we put forward constructive measures like the Kenny report Bill a year ago and renters' rights Bill in October 2021, they are the sort of measures we are putting forward as constructive ways to achieve the delivery of affordable homes. We ask the Government to take them on board and go with them in order to deliver on those outcomes.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I do not disagree with the need to pursue as wide a range of issues and initiatives that we can. This year, we will exceed our targets in Housing for All. There will be more than 26,000 home completions, the highest number of houses built in any one year since 2008. Measures in Housing for All are having an impact. It is not just about announcing strategies and plans; they are having an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The issue is that we need to build more than 30,000 houses per annum. Prior to 2020, we were at about 20,000. The need to pick up and increase capacity has been there. The good news is that there are now 40,000 more people working in the housing construction sector this year than last, and 20,000 over the 2019 level. The pipeline in terms of apprentices in the construction industry is strong, thanks to the good work of the Minister, Deputy Harris, in terms of the increased numbers coming through to work in construction trades. That is something we need to continue. We are building capacity at all levels for the long haul. We have to build 35,000 houses or more every year as we go through the decade. We have to build up to that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">The Taoiseach is no Elvis; he might be more Daniel O'Donnell. I congratulate the Taoiseach on his term in office. His many years experience as a parliamentarian have stood to him. He has been courteous and balanced, generally speaking, and has maximised, in an understated way, the art of the political announcement. I doubt there was ever a Taoiseach who was as successful at creating photo opportunities and making announcements. In fact, there were many announcements made by the Government that never got the next stage, except for when the next stage was the re-announcement of projects, such as the MRI scanner in Wexford, the 96-bed ward for Wexford General Hospital or a new university campus for Wexford. I presume the new Taoiseach will announce all of those projects again when he comes back into office.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> In saying that, I do not doubt the Taoiseach's commitment to public service and the office of An Taoiseach, nor do I doubt his sincerity. However, one thing that surprised me about him was his commitment to process rather than the delivery of projects, which is the hallmark of his Government. Many worthwhile projects are caught in political processes which collapses their delivery. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> One other thing that struck me was how the Taoiseach responded to the adverse findings by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, in respect of a senior public official. Instead of giving teeth to that finding and ensuring accountability, the Taoiseach's Government undermined SIPO by appointing that public servant to a State board, he having had a most damning finding made against him. In light of the revelations today in the European Parliament as regards the scandal of breaches in ethics and standards, and having listened to the response of the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, does the Taoiseach agree that it is now time for him to do the following? Will he give a commitment when Tánaiste that he will overhaul our standards in public office legislation to enable it to give effect to findings, ensuring he can in future stand over best practice in both standards and ethics in public office and, where they are proven to be breached, ensure rigorous, meaningful accountability? In this area of public administration we need transparency in the process to produce an effective regime, not an internal job developed by people who will be subject to the new ethics regime and who have a vested interest in limiting independent oversight. We need accountability in the public service and the Civil Service, and now is that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I thank the Deputy for the introduction earlier, although I am a bit bemused that I have earned the title, apparently, of the most successful at creating photo opportunities. I think many colleagues all over the House will be disturbed that that accolade has been passed on to me. I assure the Deputy that anybody in the Government ranks who knows me knows I am all about delivery, not photo opportunities or process. I am a very impatient politician when it comes to moving from concept to reality and to getting things done.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> As for South East Technological University, we now have five such institutions established, four, I think, during the term of this Government. That is putting concept into reality. We have been very active, particularly in respect of South East Technological University, which has been a long-running story but is so important to the economic, social and academic development of the south east more generally. The campus in Wexford is well in hand. I think Deputy Murphy and the Minister, Deputy Harris, know that. I will sound one general note of warning. All of us, politically, should be careful about chasing particular sites or land - I am not saying Deputy Murphy is doing so - because all that does is raise land values generally. The State should go in low-key when it wants to acquire land for education, health or whatever other purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">That is called agility on the floor.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> As for SIPO, I think Deputy Murphy has raised this issue over some time and I think I have been consistent in saying to her that no public official or CEO of a local authority should ever place conditions on or endeavour to influence the output of a local radio station. That is a very strong view I hold. That is fundamental to democracy. In other words, I am not saying that this happened in any given situation, but one cannot say that the consequence of one's having spent money on advertising and so on is that the station should somehow align with the views of the council or not be critical of the council. There has to be editorial independence at all times. SIPO made a judgment in that case and it fell to the county council to deal with it. We have a devolved system. We delegate to the local authorities. The Government does not have a role in a situation like that. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has engaged in a very comprehensive review of SIPO. He went out to public consultation. He has received numerous submissions. He brought the outcome of that to the Cabinet today. I wonder if there is some mental telepathy going on in the House in terms of Members' understanding of what was passed at the Government's meeting today. That was passed as well at the meeting today and approved by the Government to move now into not updating but fundamentally advancing the legislation underpinning SIPO into the future. That will eventually come to the House as well, and Deputy Murphy's input would be very much appreciated in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I begin by wishing the Taoiseach well. We have had no run-ins and we were always constructive. Hopefully, today will be no different and I will try to remain constructive. Some 100 years after the birth of the Irish Free State, this Chamber, which sits at the heart of our democracy, should be a forum in which Members are free to discuss issues which are of grave concern to the people we are here to represent. I would hope that we could do so in a sensitive but robust manner and that our Parliament can avoid becoming a place where there are unspoken rules that discourage certain questions being asked and where groupthink or complicity in silence becomes the order of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> For an increasing number of people, one of the issues that is demanding of more serious and frank levels of open debate is that of immigration, its impact on housing, health care and education and the apparent dysfunctionality that surrounds our entire asylum application process. As policy issues, these must be treated like every other area, where a clear assessment of successes and failures can be discussed honestly. They cannot and must not become no-go areas in our political discourse. Unfortunately, that is what appears to be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Every time my Independent colleague in the Seanad, Senator Keogan, tries to speak on these issues, she is shouted down. If I or my Rural Independent Group colleagues try to raise concerns we are accused absurdly and ridiculously of trying to tear apart the fabric of social cohesion. Yet what we are saying has inevitably proved correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Like many others, I am deeply concerned about the pressure and the anger that is building up in communities relating to the way in which the State has chosen to house those seeking international protection. I am more than alarmed that despite our obvious capacity deficits and the scale of the emergency, hundreds of applicants were still in tented accommodation until a few days ago, in freezing temperatures. We are at the tipping point of a real and profound social catastrophe. The rate of people entering the country from states and areas designated as safe by the EU is increasing by hundreds of percent in some cases. Our hotels are at maximum capacity. Our emergency accommodation is beyond breaking point. Our own homeless numbers are breaking records. Yet still there seems to be no plan to press the pause button.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> The key point here is that we need sustainable solidarity. What we have at present is not sustainable. We need a system that is not burdened to the point of collapse yet that is what we have. We have to adopt a new approach. We have to press pause. It is a painful but obvious truth that we must recognise. Does the Taoiseach agree?</p>

          <p eId="para_65">First, I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I assure her that no issue should be excluded from debate and discussion in this House. It is fundamental to our national Parliament that we would have open and free debate and that the voice of contrarian is always heard. I do not apply that to the Deputy in this context but the voice of the contrarian should always be heard. Groupthink is always dangerous and we should not always follow the herd on any issue, be it the economy, education or anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Historically, if you go back 100 years, or go back further than 100 years to 1916, an interesting key ingredient of our revolution was that it was internationalist. It was not a narrow nationalism. It was internationalist from day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">I am referring to the idea of Ireland taking its place among the nations of the world. Our membership of the League of Nations and UN has been about adherence and loyalty to multilateral rules-based order. Stemming from this are our obligations as members of the UN and, laterally, the EU. Ireland will soon be celebrating 50 years of EU membership. That means that when the international rules-based order is attacked, we cannot stand alone as an island that is not impacted. The war in Ukraine is a war on the international rules-based order; be in no doubt about it. Putin does not want a thriving democracy on his doorstep. Fundamentally, that is what is at stake. He has raised issues of geopolitical security. They can be dealt with and agreed upon. Leaders of the EU have said to President Putin that they are open to discussions to resolve issues to do with the security architecture of Europe. However, as we speak he is bombing innocent women, children and families. He is also bombing energy infrastructure. He is deliberately, as part of a hybrid form of warfare, creating migration, energy and food crises. I do not believe that, morally, we can stand aside. Sixty-six thousand people have come to this country from Ukraine. I acknowledge it is a huge challenge. The vast majority of Irish people have opened up and said they will do what they can. This is a wartime situation; that is what we are facing. We cannot allow Putin to win by sowing the seeds of division among us because of the pressures and challenges that inevitably arise from migration flows.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> With regard to international protection more globally, climate change and more conflict in places such as Ethiopia, in Africa, and the Middle East are all leading to increased migration. It is not only in Ireland but across the world. That is a reality we will have to continue to deal with and we have to stand up to our responsibilities and do the best we can on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I am very aware of the horrors of war, as we all are from watching what is happening, but I made the point in my speech that there are people coming in from areas designated as safe. The number of such cases is increasing all the time. This needs to be properly monitored and there needs to be a reasonable debate on the issue. We need a proper, functioning immigration policy. I suggested to the Taoiseach that the pause button be pressed. Can a meeting be sought with representatives in the EU so we would have some mechanism to pause what is happening here? People are being failed. If we are bringing in people, we are not giving them a céad míle fáilte if they are in tents or on hotel floors, as I have said previously. It is not right that people who do not need protection are coming in and abusing our system and, indeed, our hospitality. That is not right. There are people coming in from safe areas. It clearly proves our immigration policy is failing. There is no proper, functioning policy. These issues need to be looked at. There needs to be engagement with EU representatives because we have to press pause.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">First, there is a robust migration policy within the State. Yesterday, we had a Cabinet subcommittee meeting involving all the relevant Departments, which I chaired. We consistently monitor the situation concerning those seeking asylum in the country. When people come into the country to seek asylum, there is a process to deal with that. There is no choice but to deal with it once an application comes in. I assure the Deputy that, at the European Council meeting this week, the issue of migration will be on the agenda, although it was not initially. Other countries are raising it because of the general increase in migration across Europe, apart altogether from the situation in Ukraine. To my mind, the fundamental way to address these issues is at source, having regard to the societies people are seeking to leave. Questions need to be asked as to why they are seeking to leave. It may be because of authoritarianism, conflict or war. It may also be because of climate change, which is creating a migration trail as many areas are now experiencing the ravages of drought and various other weather events. Such events are creating real crises in many communities across the world. It is a very challenging situation. We need to be honest with ourselves and people more generally. It is not something you can stop; it is not that simple at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">It is not agreed. I asked the Taoiseach about the response of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, to the chaotic scenes we saw again at Dublin Airport. In his response the Taoiseach set out some of the work done by Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien. I am not satisfied with that answer. I am very concerned as we now come very close to Christmas, with huge numbers of passengers passing through Dublin Airport, that we cannot see the type of chaos, delay and distress that we witnessed during the summer. I ask that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, presents himself to the Dáil, makes a statement on the planning for Dublin Airport, and takes questions from Members.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I already raised on Leaders' Questions our concerns about the rushing through of the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill. These concerns were set out in our letter, sent by my colleague Senator Rebecca Moynihan, to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, on 1 December. I want to raise it again and our representative on the Business Committee also raised the concerns about the tabling of business in this House. We are absolutely in support of measures to speed up the delivery of housing but we have very serious concerns about the extent to which the measures in this Bill will not have the proper scrutiny they deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">We need a Dáil debate on the issue of this cold snap. We need a debate on how we will help people to keep their homes warm despite the massive increases in gas and electricity prices. The Government will say there is the €200 credit, but there are households who are burning through that €200 energy credit in the seven to ten days of this cold snap alone. Some of these households are on pay-as-you-go and could face the threat of disconnection this Christmas. There have been a lot of Elvis Presley references here in the past hour but it is now or never on this issue. We need a Dáil session to be organised on this, and if necessary the Dáil needs to meet on Friday to discuss it. We cannot have people being disconnected over Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I object in the strongest possible terms that here we are yet again at the end of a Dáil term seeing important planning legislation being rushed through without sufficient time for scrutiny. The current Bill allows for the concentration of power into the hands of the Minister when it comes to the appointment of members of An Bord Pleanála. It brings us back to the situation we got rid of in 1983 for very good reasons. It is highly regressive. This is not the way we should be doing Dáil business. Is the Taoiseach aware that with Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill we have 45 minutes to discuss 41 amendments? How is that meant to work?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">On behalf of the Rural Independent Group and in support of Deputy Carol Nolan, I ask for a reasonable, balanced, understanding and civil debate. The Taoiseach has said debate is not being stopped or suppressed in the House, but it is. Why can we not have a debate on the situation of migration? I am not talking about the war in Ukraine, which the Taoiseach has an obsession with, as I said previously. I am talking about migration from countries that have safe places and where there is no war. I have quoted figures previously to the Taoiseach. Some 3,100 people have come from Albania in the first ten months of this year with no documentation. Níl píosa amháin acu - nothing - and others have come from many other countries. The Taoiseach said our immigration and border controls are working but they are not working. How are they getting in here? We cannot afford to have them here.</p>

This is a minor amendment which enables us to get houses built more rapidly on public land that is already zoned for housing. Local authorities are getting help as well because the Minister has allocated substantial funding to them to take away historic debt and to enable them to get on with building rapid-build houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">Believe it or not, it is now seven months since the Northern Ireland Assembly election in the North and the people are still without a Government as the DUP maintains its boycott of the political institutions. It is my understanding the Tories' very reckless Northern Ireland protocol Bill has been put on ice until the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> In her address to the Oireachtas recently, the European Commission President, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, made it clear she is hopeful progress can be made on the protocol. I share that hope. Space has now been created for negotiations. The question is whether this space is being used to get a deal to restore the institutions. Mr. Rishi Sunak became British Prime Minister at the end of October. He has yet to engage properly with parties in the North. Has the Taoiseach been in touch with Mr. Sunak?</p>
          <p eId="para_350">What steps is the Irish Government taking to use the space now created to achieve progress, a result, the retention of the protocol and, crucially, government in the North?</p>

          <p eId="para_351">Generally speaking, one of the big regrets of the whole Brexit saga has been the degree to which proper thinking of the impact on Northern Ireland was never really carried out. We are living with the situation ever since Brexit and it has had a negative impact on the overall sets of relationships in respect of Northern Ireland. The British Prime Minister when I last met him, as well as everything we have heard from his office and from the secretary of state for foreign affairs, indicated a view to getting this resolved by negotiation. President von der Leyen was hopeful last week, as the Deputy said. We hope the European Union, with the United Kingdom government, utilises this opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues in relation to the protocol. Parallel to that, the DUP should go back into the Assembly and facilitate the restoration of the Executive and the Assembly.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">We heard today the Cabinet will not approve the updated climate action plan before the Dáil rises for Christmas. I understand the plan is to go to next week’s Cabinet meeting just before Christmas. That means we in opposition will not have the opportunity to scrutinise the plan in a Dáil debate. It means yet another delay in publishing much-needed plans to tackle the climate crisis. The latest update to the current plan shows 23% of targets due for completion by the end of September were missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> When will we have the opportunity to debate it? Will it be as early as possible in the new year? How can we have confidence the Government will meet climate targets if everything is subject to such delay? We are seeing delays in the publication of the climate action plan, just as we saw delays in the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.</p>

The challenges facing us in respect of achieving our emissions targets are extraordinary. A wide range of measures must be taken by every sector in society to deal with climate change. There will be ample time in this House early in the new term to debate the content of the plan. More than just debate, we need a collective resolve to implement the plan because it is extremely challenging.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">Currently, a person who is abusing a partner can refuse to relinquish their rights under a joint tenancy in social housing. If a person has a barring order against a former partner for domestic violence, the partner's name remains on the tenancy and cannot be unwillingly removed. For example, if a person needs to transfer housing, this has to be agreed to as a joint tenant. The law is inadvertently facilitating that kind of abuse. Domestic violence is a very complicated issue and there are few easy solutions but in this case an amendment to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 would make a significant difference to people, mainly women and children, in vulnerable situations. In his last few days in the role, I ask the Taoiseach to begin the process of making the necessary changes to the legislation to support victims and survivors of domestic violence.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">Householders are burning through their €200 energy credits at a rate of knots in this cold snap. I spoke to a woman on the north side of Cork city last night living in a council house with a poor building energy rating, BER. She is spending €10 per day on electricity, €10 per day on gas and €7 per day on coal and blocks. She is a pay as you go customer and her next €200 credit will not cover her until January. She will be all right as there are two wage packets coming into that house, but what happens in the house where that is not the case? Will people be disconnected in Christmas week or the week running up to New Year’s Day?</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Today, as the Taoiseach reminded me, the Government signed off on a €10 million energy poverty fund. Does the Taoiseach seriously expect people to be beating a path to the door of MABS, Alone or the Department of Social Welfare in the days running up to Christmas? Why will he not bite the bullet on this issue and extend the gas and electricity moratorium not just to bill pay customers but to all customers, including those on pay as you go?</p>

It is a good measure that is designed to target a group that is not captured by the other significant range of payments that have been made through social protection and other measures. People will not be cut off during Christmas week.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">Today I will take the opportunity to seek a commitment to retain the 9% tourism VAT rate, which is vital to my constituency of Wexford, the coastal sunny south east. Tourism businesses, hotels and restaurants, are collectively our largest employer and prior to the pandemic that industry supported over 270,000 livelihoods nationwide. That included 10,000 jobs throughout County Wexford, generating €227 million in tourism revenues annually for our local economy. In light of the turbulent times ahead, it is therefore worrying that the Government plans to increase the tourism VAT rate to 13.5% at the end of February. This will turn tourism business models on their head at a time when there are ever-increasing operational costs. On behalf of the hotel, restaurant and cafe owners and their staff throughout County Wexford, I urge that all parties to the incoming Government retain the 9% VAT rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. To be fair, the Government has been very supportive of the hospitality and tourism sector over the past two and a half years making unprecedented interventions during Covid-19. There was the reduction in the VAT rate to 9%, which has also been advantageous to the industry. The Government will give all of these issues due consideration across all of the parties the Government has in 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">The Taoiseach is aware of who Cara Darmody is. Cara is here in today in the Gallery with her dad, Mark. She is directly in front of the Taoiseach so he might give her a wave. She is the most high-profile autism advocate in Ireland today. She recently sat the junior cycle maths exam at only 11 years of age to raise awareness for the lack of therapies and assessments for autistic children. She received an incredible result of 97%, which was delivered live on the "Late Late Show". She has received the award for Munster Young Carer of the Year, she has received a Tipperary person award and she presented testimony at an Oireachtas committee only last week. She will now sit her leaving certificate at the age of 12 in an effort to raise awareness of the crisis for the 1,800 children who are waiting for assessments and supports. While her family could get an assessment for her brother, Neil, it cost approximately €1,730. Why is that so? Why can the HSE not deal with these people? She has to sit and watch Neil - and I was in the house last night - who has the mental age perhaps of a six-month-old. At the age of 12, she sees self-harming and him injuring himself and she has to endure that.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. We met in the office some months ago where we discussed these issues. It is not acceptable and I have said this repeatedly. I have convened meetings with all the relevant Ministers in the areas of education and health. There is an issue with the roll-out of the progressing disability services programme. That had an impact, in my view, on the availability of therapists in special schools and therapists more generally, which is patchy across the country. There is not a sufficient number of therapists in place to provide for children on the health side of things. While the education side has responded well, the health side has not. The HSE is saying that the recruitment of therapists is its biggest problem and challenge for assessments. We will go back to get this issue sorted.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">I wish to raise the issue of autistic children in mainstream schools who are excluded from the special care dental programme that autistic children in special schools and in special class are included in. I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter after I was contacted by the Dublin 12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion in relation to a health centre on Old County Road, Crumlin. The reply states that the dental service is not resourced to provide comprehensive dental care to all children, including those with special needs. The special care programme prioritises children in special schools and in special classes in mainstream schools, while children with special needs in mainstream classes are not targeted in special care programme. Parents whose autistic children are in the mainstream are already burdened, as the Taoiseach has mentioned, by the lack of services and huge financial burdens of paying for speech and language therapists, and physiotherapists etc., just like parents of children who are in special schools and classes.</p>

We have to look radically at this to make a broader provision for people, and particularly children with special needs. They should be prioritised in any service. There has been a long-standing, ongoing issue which includes industrial relations issues, pay issues and so forth. We have a highly privatised dental service more generally.

          <p eId="para_376">Since the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is present, I would like to ask question about the new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES. For too long, we have penalised and docked payments for farmers for having bits of habitat on their land. For the first time ever, we have a proper agri-environmental scheme in ACRES that will actually reward farmers for working with biodiversity, with payments of over €10,000 in co-operation areas. Outside the co-operation areas there will be payments of up to €7,000 per farmer per year. At the moment, it is expected that only approximately 30,000 applicants will admitted into the scheme. However, some 46,000 farmers have applied to get into this scheme, which proves that farmers want to work with biodiversity and want to farm in an environmentally-friendly manner. I ask that the capacity of ACRES be increased and that we allow 46,000 farmers to participate in the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I thank Deputy Christopher O’Sullivan for raising this issue, for which he has been a great advocate. It has also been a key priority for the Government, as well as for the three parties in government. The uptake in appetite among farm families for the scheme has proven very strong. We have had 46,000 applicants, when the expectation was that we would have approximately 30,000 in the first tranche. I would love to bring all 46,000 in. We want to be able to enable all farm families to participate in this and to back them both in their farm incomes and by working to contribute to the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> There are number of issues that need to be worked through to see if that is possible. The first is the budget and the second is the process and the capacity of the system as to whether it will be able to manage that, to ensure it gets up and running smoothly, that it works well and that people get paid on time. I am looking at all those issues. I do not know yet whether it will be possible. If it is possible, I would like to do it. It is great to see such a strong response from the farming community. As we always have done, we will continue to back farm families both financially and in making a contribution to emissions reduction and to ecosystem services.</p>

This has been ongoing for the past 11 months and it needs to be resolved. Rail passengers, including students and the elderly, who travel for up to three or four hours are still unable to access catering services whether that is to get a bottle of water, a mineral or a cup of tea on Iarnród Éireann’s intercity network across the country. Commuters cannot for the life of them understand how these restrictions are currently in place with no sign of catering services to be put in place any time soon. I think of routes such as Cork to Dublin, Westport to Dublin, and from Kerry, Cork and Limerick. Station-based shops are only available in bigger rail stations. I am calling on the Taoiseach to take up this serious matter with Irish Rail. We are now past the point of excuses from Irish Rail about short-staffing and cost issues.

          <p eId="para_381">In the 21 years of the existence of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, only once has its members had a split decision, and that was in respect of the actions of the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, in leaking a confidential document to his friend. The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman, both members of SIPO, did not accept his implication that his actions, in his then role of Taoiseach, which he judged to be appropriate, cannot be questioned by SIPO. In a podcast interview this week, the Taoiseach clearly disagreed as well with the Fine Gael leader's defence and made clear that taoisigh are not and cannot be above SIPO investigations. Considering that, what action does he plan to take in regard to his Cabinet colleague?</p>

          <p eId="para_382">That was a very summarised summary of what I said on the podcast. All members of the Government are held accountable to this House primarily, under our Constitution, and we should never lose sight of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> In respect of SIPO, it has made a decision on this. Every member of SIPO is equal. The Deputy's point is a new departure. I have no issue with there being transparency around the decisions of SIPO, but if we are now saying that because two of its members went one way and three went another way, the three who voted in one way are in some way inferior to the two who voted in an opposite direction, that creates real problems-----</p>

          <p eId="para_388">The Taoiseach has been the recipient of many good wishes today and I thank him for his support and that of his Government for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence initiatives over the past two and a half years. Unfortunately, the majority of murders in Ireland still have a domestic violence motivation. A total of 53% of sex crimes have a relationship aspect and most killings and sex crimes happen in a residential setting. Seven hundred and forty-four women were for sale for sex on International Women's Day this year in Ireland. On 19 January, the Taoiseach led tributes to Ashling Murphy following her death, and since then, with the assistance with the Ceann Comhairle, I read into the record of the House the names of the other 243 women who had died in those circumstances since 1997. Will the Taoiseach commit, irrespective of the changes at the weekend, to retaining his support for the work the Government needs to continue to do regarding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, particularly on the education front and through the introduction of a new relationships and sexuality education programme to lead the broad cultural change we need to give effect to the changes needed in Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_389">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I assure her this is a whole-of-government priority that is embedded within the programme for Government. The programme for Government is the glue that holds the Government together, and the Government collectively and the three parties in government have an obligation to follow through on all aspects of it. With regard to domestic-based violence, the agenda that has been set, with a new strategy published by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, seeks to deliver that, particularly in terms of getting an adequate number of refuge spaces in place in a comprehensive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> As for the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme in our schools, progress is being made by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, especially in respect of the junior cycle, for which the review is nearly concluded, involving the updating and modernisation of that curriculum. In parallel to that, exercises have also been way regarding the leaving certificate cycle in respect of RSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">This year, 28 December marks the 50th anniversary of the despicable and heinous crime of the bombing of Belturbet, County Cavan, which caused the deaths of two young teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly from Belturbet and Patrick Stanley from Clara, County Offaly, and injuries to many others. In September 2020, I put on the record of this House information that had come to me through the good investigative work of Dr. Edward Burke, then of the University of Nottingham, regarding the Belturbet bombing and other loyalist operations in County Cavan. Subsequently, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, confirmed to me she had referred this information to An Garda Síochána for investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> I welcome the recent announcement by An Garda Síochána of further investigations being carried out into this despicable atrocity. I wish An Garda Síochána well with this extremely important investigation and hope there will be co-operation from the public North and South, and from all authorities North and South, that will help to identify the perpetrators of that heinous crime. I pay tribute, as I have done in this House on many occasions, to the O'Reilly and Stanley families, who have always campaigned for justice for their loved ones, seeking the truth. They have always campaigned with the utmost grace and dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that every possible support will be provided by the Government to ensure this further investigation by An Garda Síochána is progressed as soon as possible and that we will at least get the truth in regard to that atrocity?</p>

He has been a persistent and constant advocate for the O'Reilly and Stanley families in respect of the horrible murders of Geraldine and Patrick. Every resource will be given to An Garda Síochána. I welcome the fact there is a further investigation and all authorities North and South should make available whatever documents or evidence they have in respect of it. No effort will be spared to bring those who are responsible for these terrible crimes to justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">It has been more than 50 years since five citizens were tried for their involvement in an attempted arms importation, although they were acquitted. The arms crisis had a long-lasting impact, particularly on Captain James Kelly, whom the Taoiseach spoke to before he died and whose family members I have been speaking to. Prior reviews have failed to include key source documentation, especially the unedited statement of his superior officer, Colonel Hefferon, which verified his testimony. The Taoiseach and I know Captain Kelly was acting under orders. Before he departs the office of Taoiseach, will he recognise that Captain Kelly was acting under orders and that the State covered up its involvement in the arms importation?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_444">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment first met on 8 July 2020. It has met on 23 occasions, most recently on 28 November. The next meeting has not yet been scheduled.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> Membership of the committee comprises the Taoiseach; the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Employment and Trade; the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, and Transport; the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht. Other Ministers or Ministers of State attend when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment is responsible for issues relating to the economy and investment. The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment had an initial focus on developing the July jobs stimulus and has since overseen the development of the Government's economic recovery plan, as well as the review of the national development plan. It has overseen the development of the Government's national digital strategy. Regular updates and analysis of economic developments are also provided at these meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> Issues relevant to agriculture can arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees. This includes the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment but can also include other Cabinet committees, such as the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change. The agriculture sector is the largest indigenous industry in the country and has a key role to play in the economic and social vibrancy of our towns, villages and rural communities, as well as in achieving our decarbonisation targets for 2030 and 2050. The Government works closely with all stakeholders in the sector on key challenges facing the agriculture sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_449"> In July, the Government reached agreement on sectoral emissions ceilings, including for the agriculture sector. The emissions ceiling for agriculture has been set at a level requiring a 25% reduction in emissions below 2018 levels for the period to 2030. Further work is ongoing to finalise a sectoral emissions ceiling for the land use, land use change and forestry sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> The revised climate action plan is at an advanced stage of preparation to ensure that the actions it contains are sufficient to meet the reduction targets that have now been made explicit. While openly acknowledging that achieving these targets will be challenging, and that agriculture has a central role in this effort by virtue of its share of Ireland's overall emissions, the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings are an essential framework to guide our efforts. No sector is, nor can be, unaffected by this shared, all-encompassing but necessary transition.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> We will continue to support all sectors through this transition. In October, Government approved the Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan for the period from 2023 to 2027. This will provide almost €10 billion of support to farmers and rural communities, with a specific focus on the contribution of agriculture to environmental and climate goals. This funding, including carbon tax funding ring-fenced for environmental actions, will support sustainable farming practices in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, most notably the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment. As outlined in the national development plan, the Government is clear in our commitment to deliver quality transport infrastructure and services in a way that addresses the objectives of compact, sustainable growth and regional connectivity, and meets our climate and environmental targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> As with all policy areas, agriculture, transport and economic issues are regularly discussed at full Government meetings, where all formal decisions are made.</p>

            <p eId="para_461">Three years ago, the Dáil voted in favour of a Sinn Féin motion which described the proposed Mercosur trade agreement as a bad deal for Ireland and for the planet. Both Fianna Fáil and the Green Party supported this motion which mandated future governments to reject this deal at a European level. This agreement would flood the European market with 100,000 tonnes of South American beef produced at a cost of up to twice the carbon footprint of Irish beef. As the Taoiseach knows, the European Ombudsman found that the Commission's failure to complete a sustainability impact assessment of the agreement constituted maladministration. The Tánaiste said the Government is seeking further enforceable commitments, as he called them, regarding climate and deforestation while Brazil has announced an expansion of its production equivalent to Ireland's national herd by 2031. Surely Brazil can provide no commitment sufficient to allay the insurmountable, unsustainability of this deal. When the Taoiseach attends the European Council later this week, I ask him to formally communicate Ireland's opposition and make it clear that we will neither support nor ratify this deeply flawed agreement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_462">The Taoiseach again referred to the revised climate action plan due to be brought before Cabinet next week after the Dáil has risen.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">I reiterate the concern I expressed earlier in the delay in the publication of this climate action plan. Indeed, it feels like Groundhog Day because the sectoral emissions ceiling earlier this year were not published until the Dáil had risen for the summer recess. There seems to be almost a strategy of delaying publication of these essential documents seeking to ensure that we meet our climate targets until after the Oireachtas has risen, thereby depriving us of the necessary scrutiny and debate. I renew an appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that we will be publishing these climate action plans in the future in better time and not with the sort of delays we have seen to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> I also raise with the Taoiseach a large question about economic investment, one of the largest capital projects of the State, namely, the national children's hospital. We have seen that the final bill while still unknown is likely to exceed €2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> On the issue of the hospital itself, I am aware that the Taoiseach will be aware of the campaign to name the hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. I lend my support to that campaign as Dr. Lynn was a suffragette and active participants in some of the key movements leading to the foundation of our State. We unveiled a portrait to her in the corridors of this House in the past week, a very worthy portrait. She was a trailblazer in so many ways, not least in her founding of St. Ultan's Children's Hospital in my constituency of Dublin Bay South back in 1919, and in her work to tackle poverty and disadvantage, especially for children. There could be no better person after whom to name the children's hospital than Dr. Lynn. We have named too many public buildings after men and I appeal to the Taoiseach, on his last session of Taoiseach’s Questions, to lend his support to the campaign to name the hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.</p>

            <p eId="para_466">There have been many reports in the past number of weeks on different sectors in farming. I am extremely worried about the focus of these reports. Any change in policy which impacts on our ability to produce sustainable food will be termed a failure. We have the modern technology which can allow us to achieve our emissions reduction and we cannot hinder our production base because that will ruin the foundation upon which our agri-food industry is based.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_165">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_467">On 9 April 2020, more than 1,000 Debenhams workers received an email telling them that they had lost their jobs. The researchers who are making a film about the Debenhams dispute have just uncovered evidence which suggests very strongly that the three vulture funds, and a consortium including Bank of Ireland, had orchestrated this liquidation precisely one year before, in order to get around Irish law where that consortium, including Bank of Ireland which I want to stress, loaded €200 million of debt onto Debenhams Ireland and the Norwegian branch, which branch was later released from this debt, so that the entire debt was loaded onto Debenhams. That debt, however, could not been enforced against Debenhams Ireland unless one year had passed. Exactly one year to the day after the debt was fixed, the 1,000 workers were sacked. Involved in this was a company headed up by somebody who is an ex-KPMG employee. KPMG was later appointed by Debenhams as the liquidators.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> This poses very serious questions about the orchestrated sacrifice of 1,000 jobs in Debenhams and raises questions about what the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment knew when it was notified by KPMG of the liquidation and of the tactical and cynical manipulation of, essentially, the Debenhams group to sacrifice 1,000 workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> I have sent the Taoiseach the material because I cannot go through it all here and I ask him very seriously to look into this.</p>

            <p eId="para_472">Did the Government discuss the issue of redress for the 100,000 apartments and duplexes affected by defects at the Cabinet meeting this morning? I know that the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, had a webinar last night with many apartment and duplex owners. They were not satisfied with that, certainly the ones I spoke to, because there was not a clear commitment to 100% redress, nor was there a clear timeline for having a redress scheme in place, nor was there a clear commitment to retrospection. The Not Our Fault campaign is having a protest tomorrow outside of the Dáil at 7 o’clock in order to press the point home that this 100% redress, with retrospection, is the only just and workable solution. If it was not discussed at Cabinet this morning and if it is the intention to discuss it next week, is that not quite problematic? Is that not a deliberate attempt to avoid parliamentary debate and public debate by doing it in the week before Christmas when the Dáil is no longer sitting?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_169">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_473">I concur with the comments of my colleague, Deputy Cahill, in respect of the ill-informed commentary that is made sometimes in respect of farm food production and its contribution to climate change. Thankfully, over many decades, there has been a very significant investment by the State and by the farming sector in modernising their farming techniques and in lowering emissions. Recently, there was a report from the Food Vision Beef and Sheep Group, and one of its proposals would provide for a sharp reduction in the suckler herd. That is not acceptable under any circumstances. It is a huge contributor to the rural economy and to our export earnings and it is similarly the case with the dairy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_474"> Again, the lazy and ill-informed narrative from so many areas in regard to climate change, the role of food production and of farming techniques does not take into account that if Europe substantially reduces its food production, then food will be imported from other systems, particularly from South America, where their farming systems are not nearly as sustainable as we have in Europe. We need a balance in this debate and we also need an assurance to the farming community, and to the food industry in general, that it will be able to continue to produce food in such a good and progressive way and that their food production systems will not have to be reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> One has to go back to 2009 when we started to grow food exports substantially. Food Harvest 2020 provided for a sharp increase in food production. Let us remember that during the years of a very serious economic downturn, it was that sector which provided very valuable and much-needed employment in every parish in this State.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">We all know that the housing shortage is creating a void in respect of the number of workers who are available in essential services like education and health, but this is also true in transport. Thankfully, recently, the Minister for Transport did a U-turn on the insane idea that we need 1 million e-vehicle cars on the road to replace 1 million petrol cars, with a much greater concentration on public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> How does the Government propose to deal with both the question of recruitment and retention of bus drivers in Bus Éireann, in Dublin Bus and in Go-Ahead Ireland because all three companies are having very significant difficulty in retaining bus drivers? The main reasons for this, and this has been shown through their unions and in surveys, is because the companies start the drivers on much lower pay compared to their more senior colleagues. The second reason is because the shifts have become very onerous. They have very little work-life balance and time with their families and it does not suit young workers. Will the Government sit down with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and look at the model where companies have to compete with each others for contracts in public transport, which are effectively driving a race to the bottom and causing us to lose, and not to retain, hundreds of young drivers.</p>

            <p eId="para_478">There is a major problem with the market structure in farming at the moment in this State. There are three main elements to that market structure. There are farmers, then, typically, factories, and then there are supermarkets. What is happening across a number of product ranges is that the factories and the supermarkets are an oligopoly, which means that they have massive buyer-power and can force the prices and the terms and conditions out of the farmers. We saw it in the beef sector in which they pushed the price of beef below the cost of production for a large number of years, meaning that farmers were making a loss every time they sold a beast.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> The same is happening now in pig production and in poultry production, especially in the production of eggs. In Cavan and Monaghan recently, farmers have had to go to supermarkets to protest about the prices they are getting for these products. Will the Government start the process of fixing the market structure in this sector and will it bring about or support the Aontú Bill to prevent the below cost-of-production sale of agricultural items in this country so that these two massively powerful elements of the agricultural sector, the factories and the supermarkets, are no longer allowed to abuse the power they have and to force farmers into poverty?</p>

            <p eId="para_480">This is one of the last Taoiseach's questions in this Dáil term. We are now 12 sleeps away from Christmas. Many children, having written their letters to Santa, are anxiously awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus. I know Santa, Mrs. Claus and all the elves are very busy making all of the presents and the arrangements for them to be delivered across the world. Can the Taoiseach confirm that arrangements are in place for Santa and reindeer to enter Irish airspace on Christmas Eve?

            <p eId="para_484">I thank Deputy Devlin for raising that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> Deputy McDonald raised the Mercosur beef deal. I am of the view that the deforestation of the Amazon has been terribly damaging in respect of climate change. I also believe there has to be balance in terms of how the food chain and food production systems across the world work. This will not be on the agenda at this week's meeting of the European Council, but I have certainly made the point at previous meetings that Mercosur is now a real problem given its irreconcilability with sustainability issues. When the motion was passed, President Bolsonaro was leading Brazil with a strong deforestation agenda. It remains to be seen how the new government will discharge its duties in respect of the Amazon, biodiversity restoration and sustainability more generally. </p>
            <p eId="para_486"> We have one of the more carbon efficient food production systems in the world, even within Europe. Therefore, it does not sit well that we would jettison or reduce a relatively carbon efficient food production system in place of a system that is much worse in terms of climate and sustainability more generally. That debate has to happen a bit more globally than it has to date. It certainly has to happen with the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> Deputy Bacik asked about the climate action plan and sectoral emissions. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has joined me. I am sure he would agree with me that there is no strategy to arrive with a climate action plan towards the end of the Dáil recess. I can assure the Deputy that in the new Dáil term in January and February, there will be ample time to resolve the matter. Perhaps now is the time to resolve this with all parties present. We will create space for a significant debate on the climate action plan when the Dáil resumes in January. That is the way to approach it. There is no strategy. It is a comprehensive plan that involves huge challenges for society. The issue will be delivering on the plan. There is no attempt to, in any shape or form, prevent the Opposition from debating the plan because we want it to accept the plan, and all of its challenges. We want Opposition and Government to collectively to resolve this and, as a society, to try to change direction and meet the targets contained in the plan. As I said, that will be extremely challenging. Deputy Bacik also raised the issue of Dr. Kathleen Lynn, a leading suffragette and key leader during the revolutionary period. Senators Mary Fitzpatrick and Catherine Ardagh have been strong supporters of the campaign and have urged me to lend my support to it. She would be a very worthy choice in terms of naming the new hospital. A lot would lend favour to naming the hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> Deputy Cahill raised an important issue in respect of meeting our climate obligations and maintaining a sustainable food production system. Travelling the length and breadth of the country, I have met many farmers who are very keen to fulfil their obligations. From what I can see, they spend a lot of time on this issue unlike other sectors of the economy. They examine it in detail because it is their bottom line in respect of farm enterprises. They want to do things properly and above board. In other words, they do not want to fight it or be told to reach a particular percentage without knowing how to get to that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> In respect of anaerobic digestion, microgeneration and a range of other schemes, farmers need to see delivery of those to assist them in meeting the targets contained in the new climate action plan. Across the globe, the world is under pressure in terms of food production and security. We need balance in terms of the variety and diversity of our food production system. We need to be careful of over-intensive and monoculture farming. I recently visited Devenish, as did Deputy Cahill, and was struck by how it can develop a carbon neutral farm with zero emissions in terms of multi-species swards, better quality soil and so on. Farmers are willing to adapt to new technologies to improve and render our food production systems more carbon efficient. That is the challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Debenhams. I do not have access to that material. He acknowledged that he sent it to me today but I have been in the Chamber for most of the day. It is not possible to address that. I will look at the issue and talk to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Deputy needs to be clear. There is no agenda in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to be involved in any shape or form in any conspiracy to liquidate any company that will involve the loss of 1,000 jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_495"> In response to Deputy Murphy, there were 46 items on the Cabinet agenda today. The Minister has made it clear that he wants to publish his proposals in advance of Christmas. There is a session of Dáil Éireann in January and February. There will be ample time for Deputies to discuss this issue with those most involved, namely, apartment owners and residents, in respect of redress for apartments and defects. The Minister has been very clear on this and has committed to it. He undertook a review and so forth and he will publish the details of the redress scheme very quickly. It is to be hoped he will be in a position to bring it to Cabinet next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> Deputy Smith joined with Deputy Cahill in respect of our food production system and broader system and the need to grow the industry sustainably. Over the past decade or so the dairy industry has grown exponentially from where it was when quotas were removed. That has to be factored in. Around the Border area in Cavan-Monaghan there are some very innovative entrepreneurs involved in food production, in particular poultry. I discovered that Silver Hill Duck is the dish of choice in Singapore.</p>

            <p eId="para_500">Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of the shortage of transport workers, in particular bus drivers, in terms of pay levels. In terms of the broader issue, there has been an expansion of services which has to be factored in. Our population is growing and there are normal industrial relations practices which facilitate terms and conditions in respect of the industry. We should have more EVs in the country, as well as more active travel and public transport in parallel with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> Deputy Tóibín must be aware that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, published an ombudsman Bill which is designed to provide price transparency in respect of the agricultural industry between primary producers, factory others and supermarkets.

We discussed the ongoing contribution to peacebuilding and the ongoing work churches undertake at community level in Northern Ireland. Both the church leaders and I recognise the importance of engagement with and respect for all communities and traditions on these islands. Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">I wish to mark the recent passing of Bethany Home survivor and campaigner, Derek Leinster. With the love and support of his wife Carol, he fought a tremendous battle for all the Bethany Home children, who suffered such horrific neglect and abuse. We owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude. Our thoughts are with his daughters, Deborah, Amanda, Gail and Kerry. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> What engagement has the Taoiseach had with church leaders on their respective contributions to the mother and baby home redress scheme? Has progress been made on the matter? I must note again my disappointment with the Government's decision to exclude from the redress scheme children who were boarded out. Religious orders and the State had a direct hand in the exploitation of such children, who were in effect abandoned to devastating exploitation, neglect and abuse within the families and communities to which they were boarded out.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> Finally, the Adoption Authority of Ireland has confirmed it is unable to respond to applications for birth and tracing information within the 90-day statutory timeline and that it will be early autumn before current applicants will receive their information.

            <p eId="para_524">The revelations of abuse from Blackrock College and the Spiritan order have led to many more survivors coming forward to disclose abuse in other schools run by religious orders, including the Vincentians, the Dominicans and others. I ask for an update on the Government commitment to hold an inquiry into these abuse claims. It has now been nearly a month since that indication was given, and it was reported then that the Government hoped to announce more detail of the plans for an inquiry before Christmas. I know the Minister for Education has been engaging with survivors, and that is very welcome. However, I have heard from survivors in recent days and weeks wondering when we will hear an announcement as to whether the inquiry will be a statutory one or whether there will be a scoping inquiry similar to that conducted in respect of the Ferns report or the Scally scoping inquiry. Will the Taoiseach indicate to survivors when they are likely to see a decision made on this important issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_527">Last week Archbishop Eamon Martin, the most senior Catholic archbishop in Ireland, backed protests outside maternity hospitals by anti-choice activists. He claimed it was "perfectly reasonable" to intercept pregnant people on their way into medical appointments. He said that to have safe zones would be "tantamount to enforcing a ban on pro-life activities, including prayer and respectful witness". Of course, it would do no such thing. Those who oppose abortion are still free to campaign against it. People are obviously still free to engage in prayer. What the legislation does is state that those who are going for medical appointments cannot be subject to intimidation by anti-choice activists. Did the Taoiseach discuss this and the need to stop these intimidatory, misogynistic protests in his discussions with church leaders? Will he expedite the long-awaited legislation on safe access zones in the new year?</p>

            <p eId="para_529">I support the request by Deputies Bacik and McDonald in respect of abuse in the past, but I also ask the Taoiseach, in the interest of balance, if the State has ever made any effort to quantify the positive contribution by the churches in this State. I think of the Covid crisis, for example, and, when many people were dying on their own and isolated from their families, the support they got from many religious in this State. Many religious buried people during the Covid crisis at great threat to themselves. They were the only group the State never thanked for the help provided during Covid. I think of Fr. John Joe Duffy, for example, who managed to hold together his community in Creeslough. I think of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Trócaire, Fr. Peter McVerry, Sr. Stan, the Capuchin Day Centre and all the schools that do tremendous work in educating our children. Is there any quantification done by the State of the positive impact that has on society?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_204">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_530">I agree with Deputy McDonald and join her in expressing our sympathies and our thanks for the work Derek did. As for the redress scheme, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, wrote to the churches seeking a contribution to the redress scheme. My understanding is that legislation is still going through the Houses, or perhaps it has gone through already. I note the Deputy's concerns about some aspects of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The point about the Adoption Authority is a fair one. I read about that during the week. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and he is concerned about it, so we are seeking to see if we can expedite and accelerate a solution because that is a bit long for people to have to wait. I think the authority underestimated the level of interest and the number of applications. It is good that so many people are applying and using the facility provided by the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> On the inquiry, which was raised by Deputy Bacik, the Minister for Education has met with the victims concerned. I think all of us were appalled again by what we saw on "The Late Late Show" last Friday night. What the two brothers featured revealed was shocking. I will come back to the Deputy. I think the Minister spoke to Opposition spokespeople and is assessing the best course of action. We will consult with Government colleagues as to the most effective way forward to get to the truth of this. That is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> As for what Deputy Paul Murphy raised, I did not realise Archbishop Martin had made those comments. In my view, hospitals are no place for protests, no matter what the issue is. They should be safe spaces. People generally visit hospitals under stress and strain for a variety of reasons. The last thing they need to see is someone protesting, any agitation or anything to do with that. It just runs counter to what hospitals should be all about.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> Deputy Tóibín made a fair point. I do not think there has been such a quantification. I was at the Presidential Distinguished Service Awards ceremony last week and there was a Fr. O'Riordan from Cork there. He spent most of his life in South Africa and did time in jail there because he lived among the black townships in the apartheid era and was imprisoned for that. So many members of churches throughout the world have led with great bravery. Unfortunately, there are those who have been involved in terrible abuse also, but there has not been quantification of the positive contributions. Most recently, I attended a new homeless facility in Cork, Edel House. An order of sisters established that many years ago and provided shelter to women who were homeless or being abused or for whatever other reason. That thrust has been maintained in the modernisation of that centre now and its mission to provide safe shelter to women in various vulnerable situations. Deputy Tóibín's point is a fair one.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 27, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> The Government recognises the importance of regular engagement with all sectors of society. In recent months I have had a number of engagements with social partners in a variety of formats. This includes through mechanisms such as the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which brings together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market and which are of mutual concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> The most recent plenary meeting of the LEEF, which I chair, took place on 5 December. It was an opportunity to look at current challenges, in particular in the areas of energy, the cost of living and winter challenges. Under the auspices of LEEF there has been significant progress on issues such as the introduction of statutory sick pay, workplace safety during Covid and the report of the high-level review group on collective bargaining.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">Other engagements I have had with social partners include meetings in recent months with both the community and voluntary pillar in August and the environmental pillar in October to discuss how social dialogue can be further strengthened, as well as issues of concern to the sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> Social dialogue and engagement between Government, trade unions and other representative groups also takes place through structures like the national economic dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council, the national dialogue on climate action, the national competitiveness and productivity council, through many sectoral groups and with Ministers and Departments directly. Citizens assemblies, including the current assembly on biodiversity loss and the recently concluded assembly on a directly elected mayor for Dublin are other models for broad-based social dialogue.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> November saw the launch of the first civic forum for the community and voluntary sector, which I opened and which will further support dialogue between the sector and local and central government.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> The Government looks forward to continuing its engagements with the social partners in the period ahead as we continue to strengthen social dialogue and work collaboratively to tackle major challenges facing the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_548">I thank the Taoiseach for his briefing and update on LEEF. We know the high-level working group on collective bargaining has reported under the auspices of LEEF. Beyond that, can the Taoiseach say what specific measures the Government will take to improve collective bargaining rates and how to provide for that in law? On a related topic, given the forthcoming EU directive on adequate minimum wages gives us two years to transpose it into law and given that it contains specific measures to ensure that where the coverage rate of collective bargaining is below 80% member states must establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining, how does the Government propose taking concrete action to reach 80% given that we currently rank 15 out of 23 countries in collective bargaining coverage with only 33% in Ireland? For the Labour Party this is a huge issue given that in particular we have some of the highest rates of low pay in Europe. The directive on minimum wages and wage setting itself is very welcome but it is also welcome because it will see us having to promote collective bargaining in law and having to move away from the voluntarist model that has characterised collective bargaining for too long in this State.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_549">I want to raise two issues that I have raised before on which progress has not been made. First is the imminent closure of the Mater Hospital long Covid clinic as a result of a HSE decision not to fund its work. Frankly, I find this decision inexplicable. I have written to the Taoiseach on this and I know Dr. Jack Lambart has done so too. The Taoiseach previously undertook to investigate the matter. What progress has been made? Is it the intention of the Minister or the HSE to respond formally to the Mater's request?</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> I also raise the transfer of disability functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. No progress has been made by either Department in the distribution of emergency one-off funding for services announced in September's budget as a consequence of the protracted delay in concluding the transfer. It was the Taoiseach's view last month that the transfer would be brought to a conclusion quickly and that the additional funding and resources would follow. That has not happened. The services concerned are in desperate straits. Will the transfer be completed by the end of this month?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_551">Budget 2023 delivered significant emergency support to cushion households from the worst affects of the energy crisis. One key welcome change was the expansion of eligibility limits for the fuel allowance payment for people over 70 years. The income threshold for those over 70 years has been increased to €1,000 a week. That is a significant and very welcome improvement to the scheme. I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for making this important change. Will the Taoiseach commit to asking the Minister to arrange for a publicity campaign to let people know about the positive change coming into affect in January?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_552">To be clear about what I was saying about Debehams, the Debenhams group which had been taken over by three vulture funds including two banks, Barclays and Bank of Ireland, saddled a floating charge of €200 million on the Irish operation. That would have been clear to anyone who was looking at it and should have been clear to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when KPMG informed it of the liquidation. It did demonstrate that this was a cynical, tactical liquidation that was orchestrated precisely to the day a year in advance in order to ensure that 1,000 workers who had given decades of service to that company would lose their jobs and not get a cent because artificial debts were imposed on the company. An ex-employee of KPMG, which I remind the House, is the liquidator, was involved in this transaction that took place a year to the day before those workers received their notice. Had it been received anything less than one year the €200 million debt would not have been there. It could not have been done. It explicitly exploited a loophole in company law which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have known about and which KPMG should have and I suspect know about. Did it tell the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment what was going on? These are the questions that need to be answered. I am asking the Taoiseach to look into them as he was the Taoiseach when all this happened for the sake of the 1,000 workers and others who could face a similar fate.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_553">Currently, over 3,000 civilian staff work with An Garda Síochána. These are people who applied for civil servant roles and were allocated, under the Department of Justice, to work in An Garda Síochána. At the moment, they can transfer out to work in another civil servant role. They are 100% civil servants like any other civil servant. However, the Government's new Policing Bill would have a dramatic impact on their employment conditions. It would effectively cordon them off and make their employer An Garda Síochána. It would mean that they could no longer transfer out of An Garda Síochána. They could no longer apply for open competitions and would likely have a significant impact on their terms and conditions down the line. Their union, Fórsa, says there has not been engagement on this matter. Will the Taoiseach commit that the Government will not proceed with the Bill as currently written without the consent and agreement of these workers who will be very badly affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_555">I have raised this very serious issue with the Taoiseach before. Small-scale childcare and ECCE services throughout the country are in serious trouble as a result of the core funding plan by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. They are going out of business. They are getting loans to pay for staff over Christmas. They are letting their children go. No other businesses will be able to open in their place. I understand that more money is going into it and that there is benefit for some but there is a sector which is far worse off and will leave and will not be able to provide a service very shortly. These are in small towns where no one else will go near it. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to meet with them?</p>

            <p eId="para_556">In his discussion with the social partners, did the Taoiseach discuss the employment regulation order for the security industry which is being held up because of a court challenge by a number of big security companies? This is pretty pathetic especially since the Government recently made arrangements to lift the pay limits on very-well paid bankers but security workers who are paid the minimum wage and are entitled to a pay increase and improvement in their terms and conditions are being held back for the last year because of this court challenge. Will the Government intervene? Will it show that it supports the workers in this court challenge and not allow them to be held back the way they are? We can intervene on bankers pay. We should intervene for this group of front-line workers who are very low paid and very badly treated.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">Deputy McDonald raised the Mater Hospital long Covid unit. That is a matter for the Mater and the HSE. I do not know what is behind all this or what is going on in there in terms of the various sets of relationships. I know the Minister is here.

            <p eId="para_561">Deputy Devlin mentioned the fuel allowance for the over 70s. It is a very good idea to have a publicity campaign to ensure that people are aware of the increased eligibility thresholds so that people who heretofore did not qualify will avail of the free fuel allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">It is a very good idea, in terms of the publicity campaign, to make sure people are aware of the increased eligibility thresholds such that those who did not qualify heretofore for the free-fuel allowance, for example, may now avail of it. The Minister should please take note.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of the Debenhams Group. I hear what he is saying. I have not seen the material but will of course examine it. I will ask the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to do so also in respect of the issues that have arisen.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> On Deputy Paul Murphy's point, in any State or Government initiative we always protect the terms and conditions of employees within the public service. That has happened with Irish Water and so on. However, the broader issue of the Bill relates to policing reform and the policing commission's recommendations, so that reform has to proceed. Parallel with that, the issues can be resolved through the normal channels and mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> On Deputy Tóibín's point on small-scale childcare and the early childhood care and education scheme, the Minister responsible, Deputy O'Gorman, has announced a review of the sector. He has had discussions with the federation regarding it, and it called off its action in response. I hope the review can bring to light the issues the Deputy has raised and see them resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of the employment regulation order for the security industry. Again, that is in the courts. We do not intervene in the courts. The comparison made is false because there was no court case regarding the banking decisions. The matter arose from a review carried out concerning the banks themselves, particularly those not owned by the State and in which we have no involvement. We do not get involved in court cases normally but we are keeping a very strong watching brief on the matter to make sure the employment regulation order is ultimately adhered to.

          <p eId="para_573">We will now hear expressions of sympathy on the death of our former esteemed colleague Bobby Aylward, former Fianna Fáil Member for the constituency of Carlow–Kilkenny. I am very happy to welcome his beloved wife and life partner, Helena, who is accompanied by Bob, Triona, Lisa, Dylan, Leah, Taylor, Mark, Margaret, Jack, Kate and Ella. It is particularly gratifying to see three generations of this illustrious family in the Gallery today. Before introducing the Taoiseach, I extend my sympathy and that of the House to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Bobby Aylward was a unique individual. There have been few people here in my period as highly regarded and respected as Bobby. When you think about it, you will realise that respect was born of a few very simple things: his absolute sincerity, the genuine nature of the man and his authenticity. What you saw was what you got. There were no airs and graces and there was no pretence. His commitment was to his family and the people in his community, constituency and country. He never let them down, ever. In his very persona and his service, his life was an example to every one of us who has the privilege to occupy a seat in this Chamber. Long may the Aylwards continue to want to be involved in the business of public representation.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_575">Gabhaim buíochas le muintir Aylward agus le Helena, Bob, Triona agus Mark ach go háirithe. Táimid go léir anseo chun ár meas a léiriú ar fhear grámhar a raibh sárthuiscint aige ar a mhuintir sa dáilcheantar Cheatharlach agus Chill Chainnigh. Is maith is eol dúin go léir go raibh Bobby go huile is go hiomlán ar a shuaimhneas i measc a phobail ina cheantar féin. Is fíor an seanfhocal a deir nach bhfuil aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin agus ba é sin dearcadh Bhobby. Thuig sé tábhacht na gcomharsan agus fiúntas an phobail ag comhoibriú le chéile. Duine de mhuintir Aylward a bhí ann agus seirbhís den scoth tugtha ag an teaghlach mar pholaiteoirí den scoth ag freastal ar mhuintir an dáilcheantair agus ar an tír seo. Mar pholaiteoir, deirim le cinnteacht go raibh aidhm ag Bobby a dhícheall a dhéanamh ar son mhuintir a dháilcheantair féin agus freastal air i ngach aon slí ab fhéidir leis.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The true strength of a democratic republic is never found in loud and angry speeches or the national headlines; it is found in those who do the quiet work of building a link between the communities they serve and the parliaments to which they are elected. It is found in those who have a positive agenda, always looking for ways to develop their country and always motivated by a strong sense of place and determination to serve. Everybody who had the privilege to know and work with Bobby Aylward saw this strength in him. It is important that we take the time today to remember him and the contribution he made before he sadly passed away.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> The name Aylward has long been associated in this House with the great county of Kilkenny, the promotion of rural Ireland and steadfast democratic republicanism. The Aylwards are renowned for being a close and supportive family, sharing their many achievements and the burdens that can come to us all. I welcome the Aylward family today, in particular Helena, Bobby's wife, who was his steadfast partner and companion for so many years. Everyone Bobby talked to during his final illness heard from him about how important it was to him to have such wonderful support from Helena, as well as from Triona, Bob, Mark and their families, whom he loved so dearly. I also want to remember his sisters, Clare, Margaret and Kathleen, and his brothers, Liam, Pat, Morris, Eddie and Sean, as well as their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Bobby was also devoted to his community and country. He used his time to make a difference and leave behind him progress that will endure for many years to come. I had the privilege to get to know Bobby during his time on Kilkenny County Council, particularly when he was its chair. Together with his brother Liam, he made sure Kilkenny's concerns were always known and that the benefits of sustained progress were felt not just in Kilkenny but also in other communities throughout the region and the country as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> It was during the by-election in 2015, however, that I got to know Bobby in much greater depth. Politically, that was a contest that shocked many, who could never understand that people outside this place might not just follow a national narrative. During that campaign, I saw the passion and empathy that made Bobby such a special person. I saw the humanity that made him such a close friend of colleagues and political opponents.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> South Kilkenny is no ordinary place. Throughout Irish history, one will find it stitched into the narrative of our nation. In the cultural, political and social movements that have defined our history, there always has been a special place for Kilkenny. However much time Bobby spent in the corridors of the Parliament or at important meetings, it was in Kilkenny, among its people and walking its fields, that he was happiest. It is not simply that he knew his way around his constituency but that he felt a deep connection with the stories of former times, his constituency's landscape and the spirit of its people. Most of all, he had a profound understanding of the challenges and needs of his county's communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> As every Minister for Education of the past 30 years will confirm, Bobby Aylward made an enormous effort to push for investment in local schools and seek help for children with special needs. The benefits of this work are undeniable in a network of schools, which are the beating hearts of their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> With the beauty of so much of Kilkenny so obvious and timeless, Bobby believed in investments that would allow people to remain in their communities. In supporting investment in roads, transport links and communications infrastructure, he was always looking to the longer term. Within Dáil Éireann and the Fianna Fáil Party, Bobby was a consistent advocate for farmers and the wider rural economy. He understood the value of building a much wider agenda than in the past and brought an intuitive understanding of this to debates, shaped by personal experience and his ability to listen to people. Price transparency and fairness for farmers comprised a very personal issue for him. The legacy of his work in putting these firmly on the political agenda has this year come to fruition in the form of ambitious new legislation. All his colleagues know this important moment for farmers was reached because of the momentum he created.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">For 100 years, the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny had been one of the toughest in the country. It has often had amongst the highest quotas required to get elected and there is always huge competition. For a candidate from outside the major urban centres, it is always an enormous challenge. Bobby got a huge vote in the last election and fell short by just a few hundred votes of helping us to win an extra third seat. His continued good humour was an example to us all, giving a sense of proportion, which stood in contrast to those who put politics above everything. Bobby was proud member of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Kilkenny party organisation, which has always been among the strongest in the country. He could see the progress that had been achieved and he believed that the key to progress in the future was to be found in the practical republicanism of the party's founding generations. For his colleagues, he was always a trusted confidante and friend. He was a constant source of honest advice, who never stopped bringing to our attention the views of the people of Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> There was, of course, another enormous dimension to him, one where he left a major mark on a national pastime. He did this in such a modest way that many here may not be aware of it. To Bobby Aylward, hurling was not just a recreation: hurling was a deep passion and an expression of community values. Throughout his life, he played a central role in securing one of the most dominant hurling forces ever seen. His club, Ballyhale Shamrocks, is by far the most successful club team in modern hurling. Last week they won their 12th Leinster title, adding to a roll of honour that includes 20 county championships and eight all-Ireland championships. A total of 20 county hurling championship titles in Kilkenny is an achievement on a scale we can only marvel at. What is striking about this is that it has been achieved in just over 50 years. It did not come from the luck of having one group of brilliant players or a single inspired manager. You become a dominant force like this across multiple generations because you have an exceptional club and a strong tradition. Bobby Aylward was central to the success of the Ballyhale Shamrocks. He served in most of the positions in the club that were important to developing its facilities and players, and he is remembered as one of the club's greatest chairmen. All who knew Bobby know that for him politics was about service, and that to be elected to represent the people of one's community was a profound privilege.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> At his funeral in July his family, community and colleagues gathered in the beautiful rural church for his funeral. It was a very sad occasion but it was also an opportunity to exchange stories and to remember what made Bobby special. I was deeply honoured to be asked by the Aylward family to speak about a departed friend. In preparing for that I spent most of an evening talking to people and trying to find a way of expressing what is special and essential about the role representatives like Bobby play in democracies. I reflected then that we find in history a near constant reflection on the place of one particular type of legislator, who is the citizen farmer: that person who serves in important representative offices but who never stops being rooted in their community and the eternal link we have with the land, along with a belief in common sense and respect for others. That was Bobby Aylward.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> As Taoiseach, and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our sympathies to Helena and the Aylward family. I assure them that we will always remember his spirit and his services. Bhí sé paiseanta faoina chontae dúchais féin agus faoina thimpeallacht. Mo chomhbhrón arís ó chroí le Helena, Triona, Bob agus Mark, agus le gaolta Bobby ar fad. Solas na bhflaitheas ar a anam dílis uasal agus leaba i measc na naomh go raibh aige.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">As Tánaiste and leader of Fine Gael, I extend my deepest sympathy to Bobby's wife Helena, his children Bob, Mark and Triona, and his family and friends. Bobby dedicated his life to public service. Today his constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny are grateful for his service to their community, a community that is much better because of him. Mar Thánaiste agus mar cheannaire Fhine Gael, ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh lena theaghlach agus lena chairde agus le muintir Chill Chainnigh agus Cheatharlach.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Coming from a family with such a strong tradition of public service and hard work, as a councillor Bobby knew what it took to represent his constituents well. The Aylward family have given lifelong service to the people of Carlow-Kilkenny - his father before him, his brother, and now his nephew. Representing the people of Carlow-Kilkenny as a Deputy from 2007 until 2011, and then again from 2015 to 2020, Bobby was tireless in bringing the voices of the people of Carlow-Kilkenny to the floor of this Chamber. From looking back over the debates we both took part in, his was a voice that was honest and forthright. His approach to politics was a very simple one: respect and time for others, always looking out for them, straight up and straightforward. For those reasons, he was liked well across all political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> My party colleague and fellow Kilkenny man, Deputy John Paul Phelan, tells me that while they came from very different political backgrounds and political parties, Bobby could not have been more helpful and encouraging to the then young John Paul in those early council elections. From Mullinavat, and a long-standing member and chairman of Ballyhale Shamrocks GAA club, Bobby knew the value and importance of community.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Perhaps the day that best connects the two of us was Friday, 22 May 2015. This was a day of great pride. Bobby was re-elected to the Dáil following his successful by-election campaign, and the referendum on marriage equality was passed. It was an important day. I know it was also a powerful shot in the arm for his party, which from that day believed it could win again and indeed did. Retiring from politics after the 2020 election, he left behind a community and constituency that is much better for knowing him. He would be proud looking back on what he achieved locally and nationally for Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> My thoughts today, and those of the Fine Gael party, are with Bobby's family, friends and community. Farewell. Ar dheis de go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">On behalf of the Green Party I would like to join the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in expressing our sympathies to all three generations of the Aylward family.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I remember Bobby first from the 2007 election, when he replaced his brother and joined this House. In that time we would not have had day-to-day dealings. With myself as the Deputy for Dublin Bay South and he as the Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny, we did not have immediate interactions over the course of the time of that Government, which went through a fairly arduous and difficult process for four years or so. However, one actually gets to test the character of the individual when one goes through very difficult times, when the voting is hard, when going out to the press is not easy, and when one must face constituents or go canvassing when times are tough. I remember Bobby at that time being a rock of sympathy, sense and support and with a good gallows humour in a way that gets one through a difficult time. It is a true test. He lost a seat in that election, like a lot of us did, but he showed that strength of character to come back. I remember reading the obituaries this summer, when the Taoiseach described that by-election when Bobby clearly impressed and moved the Taoiseach with the connection to community and to the people he clearly had. His decency did shine out. In the last election I must admit there was a certain amount of joy in our party when Deputy Malcom Noonan caught up. In that game and race, we are all engaged in the counts and we watch people jostling. Bobby just hit the last fence, as it were, and did not get that last seat. I was glad Malcolm did but the decency, strength and the regard the Aylward family have was notable at that time. It was with great regret that we took Bobby's seat. I commend him and his family on the service they have shown over the years, and continue to show, to the people of Carlow-Kilkenny and to our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">Cuirim fáilte roimh chlann Aylward, roimh Helena, Bob, Triona, Mark, Lisa, Dylan, Leah, Taylor, Margaret, Jack, Kate, and Ella. It is easy knowing they are a political dynasty the younger members of the clan being so totally at home in the House. It is an omen of things to come, perhaps.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> I was very saddened to hear of the passing of Bobby Aylward in July. I really liked Bobby. He was a good and decent man who cared deeply about people. As was said, he had a deep love for Kilkenny and especially for his own local community of Mullinavat.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Bobby was also a passionate GAA man. He lived and breathed for his beloved Ballyhale Shamrocks. I understand he was proud to be cathaoirleach of that famous club, a position he held until the time of his death.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> As the Taoiseach has said, he gave so much to those he represented, first as a member of Kilkenny County Council and later, on the national level, as a Teachta Dála. Bobby came from staunch Fianna Fáil stock. His brother Liam held the Dáil seat in the constituency for 30 years, later becoming an MEP, and their father, Bob, served as a Senator in the mid-1970s. Bobby was highly respected within the ranks of Fianna Fáil as he carried a family tradition of public service. As has been said, Bobby was an energetic campaigner during elections and I understand he brought that energy to the internal Fianna Fáil dynamic as much as he did to the rest of us. When he lost his Dáil seat in the 2011 general election, he demonstrated great resilience and staying power and was re-elected in the by-election of 2015. Bobby was a quintessential man of the people. As a public representative, he never saw a problem as too big or too small to warrant his attention. If he could help somebody, he always tried his level best; I can bear personal testament to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I got to know Bobby when we served together on the Committee of Public Accounts. I found him to be friendly, upfront, decent and above all, genuine. He always had a smile and said hello and he was always up for a chat and for the craic. I recall, a number of years ago, I was in Hugginstown to address a commemoration for the Manchester Martyrs. That is the commemoration when you carry a lit sod of turf so it was freezing cold. Following the event, I popped into the local pub, English's, to warm my bones and lo and behold, who would rise to greet me only the bold Bobby Aylward. He proceeded to introduce me in detail to everybody in the pub with great enthusiasm and humour. It was a moment of warmth that was so typical of him and one that I greatly appreciated and will always remember.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Bobby's loss is greatly felt by all who knew him, and especially by those who loved him so dearly. Ar mo shon agus ar son Shinn Féin, I extend the deepest of condolences to Bobby's beloved wife, Helena; their three children, Bob, Mark and Triona; his grandchildren; his brothers and sisters; Bobby's wide circle of family and friends; and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party.

          <p eId="para_600">It is wonderful to hear the sound of young voices in the Chamber, which represents a wonderful continuation. I want to extend to Mrs. Aylward and her family, on behalf of the Labour Party, our deepest sympathy on the passing of Bobby. I was first elected to the Dáil in 2007 and I served on the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with Bobby. Like every Member of this House, I found him to be a warm-hearted and decent person who was collegiate. He was partisan in the sense that he was staunch Fianna Fáil but he was the type of person you could work with and he was decent, affable and amiable. We all miss him and it is hard not to sense his spirit here. We are deeply sorry for the Aylward family's loss. He will be remembered and he is remembered beyond the enclave of south Kilkenny. There are others here from across the land who remember him fondly as a decent person. I extend our deepest sympathies to the Aylward family.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">I too would like to welcome the Aylward family and to extend my sympathies and the sympathies of the Social Democrats to Helena, his wife; his daughter Triona; his sons, Bob and Mark; and their extended family. I was aware that Bobby had grandchildren and that tells you something. Like Deputy McDonald, I served on the Committee of Public Accounts with Bobby. When you were in the Dáil with him you were acutely aware of where he was from. He was most definitely from Kilkenny and I knew that well.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I was sad to hear of his passing earlier this year and I had not realised that he had been so ill. His biggest personal attribute was his likeability, which takes you a long way. By-elections are different and there was some surprise that he was elected in the 2015 by-election. His likeability explains a lot of that, as well as hard work. As someone who won a by-election, I know they can be different and that tells you something about Bobby.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> As I said, we were on the Committee of Public Accounts together and there are different ways of approaching things in that committee. You can be combative and probing or you can be chatty. I remember when Bord na gCon was before the committee, he was particularly effective in that he just chatted to them and got some replies we were a bit surprised about. None of the rest of us were capable of doing that on that day and that stands out for me as a particular way of doing things. It shows that you need variety in the Dáil and you need people who do things differently because we all bring something different. Bobby will be remembered and again I express my sincere sympathy.</p>

I know their nephew Robert well. He is a garda in Wexford and Clare, Bobby's sister, lives not far from me. Although our paths never crossed as I am quite new to politics, I am well aware of the great dynasty of the Aylward family. They are not far away in Mullinavat and we have a lot in common, including a lot of neighbours in common.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> From the perspective of the conversations I have had about Bobby, I know his first love was his family. His second love was probably the GAA and politics came in third. From that perspective I know that it is a tough time of the year. Christmas is always a little more lonely for some reason. I can see in Helena's expression how much she misses him and I want to say, with our deepest sympathy, that we will keep her in our thoughts and prayers.</p>

Cuirim fáilte roimh his wife Helena, his long-standing partner; his family, Triona, Bob and Mark; agus an Athair Eamon. Bobby often got a refuge for us in Dublin and sent many friends up to Fr. Eamon's house, where he looked after us well. I too want to say what a contrast there is in the weather. The sun shone so gallantly on Mullinavat on the evening of his wake and the day of his burial. Crowds turned out and they all wanted to tell us stories of the love they had for Bobby and the turns and efforts he made on their behalf. It is wonderful to see his grandchildren here, especially at this time of Christmas when they are all getting ready for Santa Claus.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> There was more to Bobby than this House. The GAA was his love and he loved farming, the land and sport, including greyhounds and coursing. He fought gallantly on coursing and he had an understanding of coursing, the odd race and the odd flutter. Bobby was a man to argue his point strongly but you would go away then and have a deoch beag and a bit of craic with him and that was the end of it. Any bit of animosity was left behind in the Chamber or wherever and he socialised with everybody. Bobby is a tremendous loss to his wife Helena.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">His late father and his brother Liam were here and his son is a councillor, so it is a legacy. The family has given to the community and the county of Kilkenny. We often had different words at a time of a Kilkenny-Tipperary semi-final or all-Ireland final. I know how much he loved his club, his family and the countryside. All the things that were really important to him were of and in the community - the land. I was aware of the new hedge-cutter and tractor he bought. He always had those chats with me about them. He loved the animals. When they did well and he sent them to the factory, you always got that from Bobby. You got an understanding of farming from Bobby if you had never farmed or had anything to do with farming because he was able to impart that knowledge. Ar dheis a lámh Dé go raibh a anam dílis. </p>

We became very close friends during the few years we were together in Dáil Éireann. Indeed, I have to say that Bobby was everyone's friend. He loved his family, politics, farming and hurling - all the things country people tend to live for. He served his people with distinction and was a proud Member of the Dáil. He told me how elated he was when he won back his seat in 2015. I was devastated when I heard that he lost it in 2020, because it was not because he was not working but there are winners and losers in every election. Bobby was a great man and I am glad to get the opportunity to wish his family well. I know they are broken-hearted, as we all are, on his passing. He suffered a tough couple of years and at least we know he is in a better place now. Coming into Christmas, all I can say is God is with you because Bobby was that kind of person and he lived for his family and the people he represented here; a wonderful and powerful man. I will never forget him. Things are not the same this term as they were the first term. We became very close friends on a daily basis while we were up here and I thank him for that.

          <p eId="para_610">The Aylward family is synonymous with Fianna Fáil. Through farming politics, I became very friendly with Liam when he was an MEP in Brussels. My first contact with Bobby on a personal basis was campaigning on the 2015 by-election. I had recently got the nomination in Tipperary to stand in the 2016 general election. We were marshalled to go across the border to canvass for Bobby. I remember we canvassed on a very wet day in Urlingford. We were very wet when we came in about 4 p.m. to get some refreshments and we definitely had a very enjoyable evening thereafter in Butlers. That was one of my first intimate encounters with Bobby.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Fianna Fáil had a very successful general election in 2016 and a number of people were elected. Very quickly, a group of Members started to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday nights in the Dáil bar. It included Margaret Murphy O'Mahony - all five foot of her as Bobby used to refer to her, John Curran, Kevin O'Keeffe, Eamon Scanlon, Dara Calleary, Michael Moynihan and myself. The banter would be fairly vicious and the scuds would be flying low and hard. There was great craic and camaraderie and we really miss it. He was the cornerstone of that conversation - sitting in the corner with his back to the wall - and was definitely the chairman of that group. As a Tipperary man, the pulling was often low and hard during the hurling talk between us. I really enjoyed coming back in 2016 and 2019 after the summer recess and us winning two all-Ireland championships and beating the oul enemy. We had had a lot of reverses in previous years but they were two very enjoyable encounters when I came into the bar. He would be sitting there when I came in and I can still see him in the corner with a scob waiting to congratulate me and get the ordeal over with. I see Laurence in the Gallery. He was more than his PA. He was an exceptionally loyal friend to Bobby and was always looking out for him and was always there throughout Bobby's illness. </p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Myself and Bobby were cut from the same cloth. Both of us came from farming stock. We had an awful lot in common. It was a privilege to call him a friend and may the sod of his beloved Kilkenny rest lightly on him. </p>

The one thing Bobby could never understand is when he discussed hurling, I would discuss cricket. It was one thing he could never agree with me about. We travelled a bit and went to weddings in Kinsale. Everywhere you went, people loved Bobby. He was gregarious and his personality was infectious. As every Member who has spoken so far has said, you could not but be his friend. I have never heard a person say a bad word about Bobby Aylward. He helped those of us who came in here all the way through. He gave us perspective, including about the job we do, because he put his family first. He loved his party but we loved him and still do and will never forget him.</p>

          <p eId="para_615"> I got to know Bobby in around 2009. I was elected to the council and was very new to the whole electoral system. Although Bobby was not on the council at that time - he was a Deputy - he was extremely helpful and kind. I got to know him even better during the 2015 by-election because I was running in it. We had some of the best times during that. Obviously, we were rivals but at the same time, you could always have a laugh with Bobby. He was so helpful, particularly to somebody new. You are not always sure about procedure and have nerves around speaking publicly. He was incredibly kind and helpful. This has been my experience of Liam and Councillor Eamon Aylward with whom I served on the council for a few years. He was unbelievably helpful and kind and really worked for the constituency and the good of Carlow-Kilkenny. I offer our sincere sympathies to Helena and the wider family. </p>

          <p eId="para_617"> I also had the privilege of travelling to Tanzania with him. We met the public accounts committee there. He left a lasting impression on me, although I did not know him very well. He had a unique way, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, of deflating pomposity and getting to the kernel. I have a photograph on my phone of him holding a hurling stick in a convent school in Tanzania. That is my memory of him.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">First, I welcome Bobby's family, including his wife Helena, his sons Bob and Mark, his daughter Triona, his seven grandchildren and his siblings. Bobby was fortunate to have served as a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny, replacing his brother Liam, from 2007 to 2011, and then from 2015 to 2020. I know that Bobby was deeply committed to the people of Carlow-Kilkenny as a public representative. He was always very supportive of me. He was a great friend to my father, and they had many a drink together. Bobby was a proud Mullinavat man, very much a part of his community, and of course the biggest cheerleader for Ballyhale Shamrocks. He would have been so proud of the team this year. I am sure he was smiling down on them as they won their 12th senior club hurling title. Just as he did for his club, he gave a tremendous amount to the people of Carlow-Kilkenny over the years, and he was a champion on behalf of his people and his area. I hope we can all take some of that, because we all knew Bobby, and put it to good use in our own way by keeping a smile on our faces, making plenty of time for chat, keeping the graces without the airs as he did, and by always trying to be fair. Whatever we do, we should always fight the fight for the people of our counties.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">I welcome Helena and all of the Aylward family and the extended family. I am reminded of the chill that runs down your back when you hear the next generation or the generation after that making their first contribution to Dáil Éíreann. I am sure that would not be lost on Bobby, if he was here today. I served with Bobby on the county council and in the Dáil. I also served and soldiered with his brother Liam as a young man in politics when he addressed meetings in the Metropole Hotel, and I knew his father, Bob. In all of that time, I learned from all of the Aylwards that family and community are the keystones to their political beliefs. Everything stems from that. When Bobby contributed either at a committee meeting or in the Dáil Chamber, he held firm to those beliefs. In the parliamentary party meetings of Fianna Fáil, he held firm to those beliefs and was not afraid to take on a Minister or anyone else who held a view that watered down the republicanism of the party or the policy that was being discussed at the time. However, he was never angry; he was always a gentleman. That hid the fact he was a formidable figure, representing a formidable family, as we have heard in the contributions made today. When they went canvassing, you did not see anything like it. Nothing stood in their way in their attempts to get elected. Again, that goes back to the values of family and community.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> On the day that Paul Shefflin was buried, Bobby led out the guard of honour. He was at an advanced stage of illness and was very weak. Triona was there with him and we chatted as we left the graveyard that day. What struck me about that day was the sense of community and the sense of place. The Ballyhale Shamrocks, the GAA and Fianna Fáil turned out in numbers, and colleagues from the other political parties and none travelled to the constituency to pay tribute to Bobby Aylward and his family, to express their sympathy and to come together as a community in support of someone they had lost. When I spoke to Bobby that day, he was extremely weak but yet he turned out and walked the distance for his club and his club member. That underpins his commitment to the GAA, Ballyhale Shamrocks, the family and so on. It would be remiss of me not to mention Bobby's son Mark and his role in the game next Sunday. I know Bobby would be proud of it. I wish Ballyhale Shamrocks victory over Ballygunner. I am sure it is okay to say that here.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> I also remember the 2015 by-election. I acknowledge the former Members who are in the Public Gallery today. It is not just the current Members who are paying tribute to Bobby Aylward. As friends, they have turned out today to be part of this celebration of Bobby Aylward and his contribution to Fianna Fáil, Irish politics and his own community. The party is represented by Seán Dorgan, who I see in the Gallery, and other people who worked with Bobby and became his friends. I note Joe Malone from the Kilkenny City Vocational School board is present. In his day, Bobby Aylward made a huge contribution to the development of the school. That contribution has been acknowledged by Cathy McSorley.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I became close to Bobby because we sat together on the benches on the other side of the Chamber. We were forced to sit together when we were voting. During that time we shared stories that may never have shared had that not been the case, because of the competitiveness of constituency colleagues and so on. I only got to know then that he did the crossword over a cup of tea, and that he loved watching the videos that are a bit craic on his phone. I also found that he knew intimately every single case that was brought to him. He was prepared to go the extra mile for those who came to him and for the community projects he was involved in. In whatever he had to do, he was prepared to go the extra mile. I have fond memories of Bobby. In the 2015 by-election, someone said he was the authentic voice of rural Ireland. That was very true. Until the last day that he served in the House, he served rural Ireland and the people of Carlow-Kilkenny. He made a definite and positive contribution. All of the Aylward family can feel very proud of that Bobby did.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Before I finish, I also want to mention Deputy Cowen. In 2015, he was given the unenviable task of pulling together two dynasties that were at each other for a lifetime in order to win that by-election. I do not think anyone else could have done it better than Deputy Cowen. May Bobby rest in peace. His family and friends can take comfort from the huge contribution he made to Fianna Fáil and to the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_625">I join others in welcoming Bobby's family: Helena, Bob, Triona, Mark, Fr. Eamon, his siblings and his grandchildren. I think nearly half of Fine Gael Deputies have made contributions. I welcome Bobby's family to the House today and the opportunity to say a few words about Bobby. He was the worst type of political opponent you could have because, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, everybody genuinely liked him, so much so that when it came to my own campaign, all the members of my team loved him. The campaign was made all the harder because of his gentleness and kindness. He was a big, warm, kind person. We fought nearly every election together. His first local election was in 1999 and his first general election was 2011, as were mine. The by-election was in 2015 and the general election was in 2020. As the Taoiseach said in his comments earlier, not being from a massive population centre makes it hard to get elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> As the crow flies, there are a few miles, and mostly cows and trees, between Knockmoylan and Smithstown, where I am from. I echo Deputy McGuinness's comments about the Aylward family campaigning. They were a sight to behold. Deputy McGuinness mentioned the Aylward siblings. There were eight or nine of them, along with their mother, Kitty.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">She always canvassed on our road. Everyone loves an Irish mother and Kitty was a doughty campaigner herself. They all had that warmth and way and that sense of place, which I always envied from an opposition party perspective but I grew to love when I got to know them all so well over the years. I, too, was beside Deputy McGuinness at Paul Shefflin's funeral. While the end was no surprise when it came, it was still greeted with tremendous shock and sorrow for somebody who epitomised all that was good about the old style of Irish politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I remember being in Andy's Bar in Ballyhale after the local elections and European elections of 2014. The European Commissioner had not been appointed. Bobby looked over at me, obviously knowing far more than I did about who the European Commissioner was going to be and the likelihood of a by-election coming up in Carlow–Kilkenny. He was the epitome of the perfect candidate for a big two-county rural constituency in that his name was known and he had such a warm way with people. That was a vital election for him and his party after the 2011 election defeat. He was the perfect person to take it on and win it.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I remember my early days as an opposition Senator in the other House when Bobby was a new Deputy. I had a very difficult query that I had to solve for a prominent Fine Gael family in my area. I went to Bobby and the then Minister, Mary Coughlan, and the problem was solved. He knew he would never get a vote when he helped but the problem was solved; they were his friends too. The abiding memory I will have of him is his gentle way and support for people. Regardless of what colour you wore in politics, Bobby respected people who were elected and helped them as best he could.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> On behalf my family and I and, indeed, the Fine Gael members and supporters in Carlow–Kilkenny, I express to Helena and all the Aylwards our very sincere sympathy with them on their loss and share with them our remembrance. We will not forget that he was really good man who left his mark here and in other places. I attended the county convention of the GAA last night in County Kilkenny and he was mentioned again, as he will be in places like Irish's Bar in Hugginstown. I never heard it referred to as English's Bar; there will be talk in Hugginstown tonight about that. He represented Carlow–Kilkenny and, in particular, his part of south County Kilkenny, with distinction and honour all of his life. We will never forget him for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">Ar dtús, cuirim fáilte roimh an gclann Aylward anseo inniu.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> I was first elected to Kilkenny County Council in 2004. Bobby had served for a few years on the local authority at that stage, so I had the privilege of serving with him for a few years before he was first elected to Dáil Éireann. Even on my first day, which, like anyone's first day after an election can be a very daunting experience, Bobby was the first person over to me to offer his support and whatever help he could. That was the measure of the man he was. I was elected mayor in 2009 and he wrote a beautiful letter to me. Both of us contested the 2015 by-election. Like Deputy Funchion said, it was always a great pleasure to meet Bobby out canvassing wherever it was. When you saw an entourage of Bobby's team coming down the street, you knew you were defeated anyway. It was great, however. He was great fun and a great companion.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> One of the early challenging issues we had to address shortly after being elected in 2004 was a Traveller horse project in County Kilkenny. I will never forget the way Bobby spoke in favour of that project. Discussions around issues concerning Travellers could always be challenging in local authorities back then and it still is the case at times. I will never forget it. It struck me then at that early stage that Bobby was a man for the common good. From that day on, I could not but be deeply impressed by his sense of justice and what was right. We are hearing in spades about the measure of Bobby Aylward this afternoon. He was a man rooted in his community in rural Ireland; his beloved Ballyhale Shamrocks and farming. As I said, though, above all, he was also a man with a deep sense of the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Back in 2015, when I contested my first by-election, we had fun in the hustings but in debates as well. He brought that common-sense approach. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, that was always deeply impressive from him. I express my sympathies to Helena and the whole Aylward family. We are very privileged for having met a man the measure of Bobby Aylward. It is a great privilege to have known him. The tributes paid to him today are testament to what he represents.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_637">That Dáil Éireann has confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O'Brien TD.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The Minister took up office at one of the most difficult moments in our modern history. The largest public health crisis and fastest moving recession to ever hit our country had brought a sudden halt to most aspects of economic and social life. It was a moment of great uncertainty about the future, and for every Minister. They were responsible for making sure public services kept functioning and urgent help was provided to families, businesses, and communities facing threats to their health and livelihood. The Minister dealt with the challenges faced by his Department with great dedication and commitment. He ensured local authorities received extensive aid at a critical moment of need and that services were restored as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Critically, he also did not wait to begin work on addressing the most important challenge he and all public representatives face, which is to significantly increase the supply of homes for people to buy or rent. No matter how serious a problem is, there are those who are willing to claim that nothing has been achieved until everything has been achieved. The only way to deliver more homes to buy or rent is to implement a full series of actions which deal with every element of the problem. More training places for critical trades, faster planning and development procedures, a new era in social housing, support for affordable homes for lower and middle income earners: these and many other elements are essential to step-changing housing delivery for our growing population. The plans the Minister has developed and is implementing are already making a difference. Tá na pleananna atá forbartha agus curtha i bhfeidhm aige ag déanamh dul chun cinn suntasach agus athrú chun na maitheasa cheana féin fud fad na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> When you put aside the angry bluster and populist nonsense, you see a hard-working and creative Minister who has led his Department well in the past two and a half years. He has substantially changed the direction of housing policy, introducing a new era of building social and affordable homes, and is implementing the first comprehensive programme for action, not just on one or two elements of the housing sector but on every element. What is more, this action is starting to work. In spite of being directly and personally targeted by Opposition parties and their online trolls, he has won every debate on this topic, exposing the vacuum which lies behind the mock anger and book-length emptiness of those who pretend to care about housing but just see it as another topic to exploit.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">This is unfortunately a very populist moment we live in. It is increasingly hard for even the most important issues to be debated in a serious way. For example, during the roll-out of the vaccines, even one of the most successful programmes in the world was relentlessly attacked in political and media circles for failing to deliver everything immediately. According to this approach, until everything has been achieved nothing can be acknowledged and there is no such thing as a complex answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> There is a clear and widening divide between those in this House who want to serve the people and those who are only interested in playing cynical politics. There is a difference between those believe ours is a country which has achieved great things but must overcome urgent challenges and those who will mount any passing platform to claim nothing has ever been achieved in what they claim to be a failed state. They fake empathy for every group but systematically fail to show how their growing cascade of promises can be achieved. We are perhaps unique in Europe in having an Opposition which stands on every side of most issues: claiming to support action on climate but touring the country to find groups who want to hear them oppose every concrete step to combat the climate emergency; pretending to support Europe but systematically voting against it and condemning it at every opportunity; and showing mock concern for workers but constantly attacking policies central to supporting thousands of well-paid jobs. </p>
          <p eId="para_644"> Housing is perhaps the area where the Opposition trots out its rehearsed anger most but where its actions are almost breathtakingly cynical. A collection of people who angrily demanded we implement the disastrous zero-Covid policy has not the slightest credibility to anyone who cares to take the time to examine exactly what they propose when attacking the Government and its Ministers. It is important for us all to note that Opposition Members are not the slightest bit interested in more homes being delivered. The sole reason we are having this debate is they thought it would give them another opportunity to attack the Government. Their problem is they are attacking a Minister who is already making a significant positive impact. The measures he has put in place are starting to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> Any honest debate about housing must start from the central fact that there has been a major increase in the demand for homes due to a rising population and a rising number of separate households. Within this, we have the exceptional response required to deal with supporting people whose homes are under attack in a vicious invasion and war against a democratic state. Any honest debate about housing will hear the stories of those in difficulty but also acknowledge the full picture. It will hear about those who find house prices impossible for them but acknowledge that new policies are having an impact, with 16,000 first-time buyers in the past 12 months. Honest debate must acknowledge that of all the public policy areas, this is one which requires sustained action for reform and investment over a significant period. </p>
          <p eId="para_646"> The Housing for All policy agreed by the Government and being implemented is unprecedented in scale and ambition. It represents a radical direct public intervention in the housing market. The claims it is an ideologically market-driven strategy are manifest nonsense. The Government has agreed and put in place funding of €4 billion per year to implement the plan. For a dramatic demonstration of the emptiness of Opposition housing policies, look no further than the fact that this is 40% bigger than the amount called for by Sinn Féin. When it comes to public investment in housing, we are delivering significantly more than the Opposition demanded.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">Our plans address every element of housing provision, starting with the most basic of training for more craftspeople to build and renovate homes. Thousands of new apprenticeships are in place and people are being trained in new and urgently-needed skills, including those who will support our programme to insulate social and private housing to reduce energy bills permanently and help meet climate targets. As a result of our policies, there are today 20,000 more people working in construction than before the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Any fair person knows a major blockage in housing is also found in the length and complexity of our planning procedures. Almost no other country experiences the type of systematic objections and legal actions used to try to stop so many projects. Added to this is the policy of the largest Opposition party to oppose systematically significant developments using an ever-changing list of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Every single politician and party has spoken against some projects but no one has ever come near the industrial-scale opposition to constructing homes which is a defining part of Sinn Féin’s electoral strategy. There are thousands of homes which they have sought to block in Dublin alone, more than 5,000 since the last election. While they have not always succeeded, they have often delayed vital projects. This is not an accident; it is a policy and it is an abuse by a party that desperately wants housing to remain as an issue to be exploited. </p>

          <p eId="para_654">Reform of planning laws is an essential part of delivering more homes and faster. We must protect the right of individuals to be heard and for legitimate concerns to require the revision of projects. However, the balance to date has made Ireland an outlier in how long and how often legitimate projects are delayed. This must change and it will change with the new legislation which we will be publishing shortly. Priority will be given to speeding up decisions relating to social, affordable and cost-rental housing. It is unfortunately already clear that the Opposition will vote against this legislation, once again claiming to care while trying to block action. This Government believes in the State playing the central role in providing for people who cannot otherwise find housing. That is why we have initiated a new era in the State purchasing, building and renovating social homes. There have already been more than 18,000 social homes added under the Minister, Deputy O’Brien’s tenure, including over 11,000 newly constructed social homes. We are implementing a range of major supports to tackle derelict sites and to bring them back to use as homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> The time available in this debate does not allow me to go into detail in every area, but the progress we have made in helping people buy their own homes is not even acknowledged because the Members opposite hold an ideological position of opposing schemes that help people to own a home. In these and in many other areas, any fair evaluation of the record of the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, and the Government will acknowledge the progress has begun despite the unprecedented challenges of the last two years. He has not only produced a clear and ambitious strategy, but he is also implementing it and it is making a difference.</p>

          <p eId="para_657"> In the growing division of politics between those who want to solve problems but those who just want to exploit them, the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, has shown his ability and his commitment to delivering the sustained action which is the only way of providing the homes our people need.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">It is hard to switch from one subject to another. We have been speaking about Bobby Aylward and what people said is on my mind. That description of him as a republican stuck with me and I cannot stop thinking about it. I was watching the Civil War television programme last night on RTÉ. I do not know if anybody else saw it but it stuck out that people who were the best of friends were fighting each other. They were on the same side one week and then the next week they were at odds. Many of parties in this House have roots in that republican tradition. In fact, the very socialist parties, I would imagine, would claim a similar understanding of that, which is that we are all equal. That is the first premise of socialist thinking. From a Green Party perspective, one of our founding principles is trust in the people, trust in constitutional democratic systems and trust down to the lowest, most effective level. We, too, have a republican bone in the very centre of our body.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> I mention that because I do not think that it matters whether you come from Malahide or Mullinavat. It is important how you see the world. If you come with that republican tradition, that is a central test in this democratic House as what you will deliver, what you will do and what decisions you will make. I think the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, who is from Malahide comes the same republican tradition of which we just heard about the Aylwards in Mullinavat. That is important in a world in which, as the Taoiseach said, it is so easy to play it up and say, “You are the bad guys and we are the good guys”, or to divide our country between young and old, or rural and urban. That does not work for people either rural or urban.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> There is a depiction of Ministers that if they cared, they would address the housing crisis or that if they had similar ethics or a belief in the people that some people have, we would all be sorted and there would not be not a problem. In my mind, that is false argument which I do not believe to be true.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The Minister, Deputy O’Brien’s job is not easy, nor is anyone’s job in wider Government. It is never easy in politics but this has particularly been the case in recent years in the delivery of housing, where there have been a number of headwinds. There is the fact that during Covid-19, we could not get people working on buildings at the time when we most needed people working on buildings. There is the fact that interest rates have just risen and a lot of the projects that would otherwise get built and funded will now not happen. This is a real challenge. There is the fact that global inflation, the price of steel, the price of all the raw materials and the supply chain are proving difficult and will add to all those headwinds. It is not easy, but I believe the broad approach that has been taken by the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, has been the correct one.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> In the Housing for All programme the word “All” is republican in its perspective. This Government is looking to deliver that - housing for all our people while prioritising social housing for those most in need who cannot protect or provide for themselves. The statistics or the numbers are clear in terms of meeting our targets this year despite all those headwinds. In particular, we have scaled up social housing delivery in a way that has not been done in this State for many decades, or for most of my lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I could cite other examples of real progress. In Cabinet today, we were discussing the various elements that we, as a party, have been arguing for decades, which is that we listen to that constitutional case which was made four or five decades ago that the increased value from zoned land does not belong to the landowner, but to the wider people. We are legislating for that. We are also legislating for what condemned and killed this country's housing for decades, which was the storing of land as a wealth gaining measure. We will take that on by introducing a land use tax that taxes land that is zoned but has not been developed. During the week, I heard others arguing against that and I can understand their concerns, but I think it is right and the republican thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Similarly, there is the redefinition by this Government of what is possible in housing with the introduction of cost-rental housing. This is a critical, historic change towards creating a new form of public housing that is open to everyone. That will bring the price down in a real way. We all agree that the rental sector and our young people are being hit hardest, particularly those who are trying to raise a family. That cost-rental housing offers real hope. I have heard the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, speak about how he is determined, as this Government is, to scale it up massively. I believe that will be seen as one of the most transformative changes that will come in this time of real change.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I could go on. Croí Cónaithe, the town centres first philosophy, is a change from the abandonment of towns that has occurred for the past four of five decades and it will start bringing people and life back into the centre. That is happening under this Government with all of the challenges that are involved. There is Croí Cónaithe, Project Tosaigh and the planning reforms. In Cabinet today we discussed a significant and essential upgrade of the planning system so that we can help to deliver housing for our people. We cannot on the one hand hammer everyone, saying they are not doing enough on housing, but then when they start deliver, saying that they are doing too much or that they are doing the wrong thing, as though there was there was a magic, easy, alternative formula. I do not believe there is one.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I will vote in support of confidence in the Minister, our colleague. I will do that in the determination that in the next two years of this Government we will deliver the housing our people need and we will deliver the change, particularly in how we see public housing. We will build back into the centre and build communities. This is still ringing in my ears from hearing about the Aylward family.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">We deliver community when we deliver good housing, and we are determined to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">Sinn Féin does not have confidence in Deputy Darragh O'Brien as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Opposition in this Dáil does not have confidence in the housing Minister and, more important, the people do not have confidence in him. How could they have confidence in a housing Minister who, with a straight face, says we do not have a housing emergency, or in a Minister who has turned to denial when the consequences of his failures are writ large in the everyday lives of people who, despite doing everything right, still cannot put a secure, affordable roof over their heads?</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> It has been three long years since the most recent election and the Taoiseach said his would be the Government to fix housing. He sang that from the rooftops. He has spent those years telling us housing is the number one priority for the Government. If that were true, we should have seen real action, ambition and urgency from the Minister, but we have not seen those things. We have abject failure from a tired Government and a housing Minister clearly out of his depth. The Minister has simply recycled the types of policies that got us into this mess in the first place, putting the interests of big developers, wealthy investors and corporate landlords ahead of those in housing need every time. Of course, this Minister is just the latest in a long line of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael housing Ministers wedded to the belief that in the end, the market will resolve the emergency, and it is the people who live with the dire consequences of that approach, namely, record house prices, record rents and record homelessness. That is the reality of the Government's housing legacy and it is Deputy O'Brien's legacy as housing Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The Taoiseach gaslighting Opposition Deputies, the Tánaiste telling desperate young people that the grass is not always greener, and mindless, delusional, self-pitying guff cannot disguise that fact. You would imagine that when faced with such a social catastrophe, the Government should respond with ambitious social and affordable housing programmes. The Government has been told repeatedly that large-scale public housing is the answer - only this week, the ESRI restated that reality - but we get housing targets so out of kilter with the gravity of the emergency that the Minister's own officials have rung the alarm bell. We have targets set and targets missed, deadlines set and deadlines missed. That is the performance of the Minister amid the most serious housing emergency in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> A common refrain from the Government, reiterated by the Taoiseach and the Minister, is that housing cannot be resolved overnight. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have had more than a decade to resolve housing and they have succeeded only in making things worse. Not alone has the housing emergency robbed people of the ability to put a roof over their heads but now it is impacting on education, healthcare and jobs and investment, areas vital to Ireland's progress, prosperity and success. Teachers and healthcare workers throughout Ireland are struggling to find affordable housing, schools and hospitals are struggling to recruit and retain staff, and schoolchildren and patients are the ones paying the price. As a result of Government failure, many teachers and nurses have simply given up. We are now losing them to the chance of a better life abroad. Business organisations now tell us the lack of a coherent direction from the Government on housing is turning off investors. Reports from chambers of commerce in counties such as Waterford contain case studies of people turning down good jobs with good salaries because they cannot find an affordable place to live. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has himself admitted that the housing crisis has placed the regional enterprise plan in real jeopardy.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> There we have it: a housing emergency, with healthcare, education and investment in jobs affected, and it goes on and on. This contagion has happened because successive Governments have stood back and hidden behind excuses. First, the then Government could not fix housing because of the international financial crisis and the crisis here designed by their good selves. Then it was Brexit, then it was the pandemic and now the Government says it cannot fix housing because of the inflationary crisis. People are not naive. We all know these developments brought challenges - for sure - but those were challenges to be met with ambition and determination, not difficulties to be hidden behind by a Government to cop out of its responsibilities. The common denominator in this never-ending housing crisis is the presence of a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-led Government with a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael housing Minister. An entire generation has come of age listening to those parties' jaded excuses and broken promises, they are sick of a Government talking about the construction of houses they will never be able to afford-----</p>

          <p eId="para_674">-----and sick of walking past fancy apartments they will never live in. So, locked out of affordable housing and of opportunity by the policies of the Government, our young people now look to the airports and to life in Toronto, Boston or Sydney. We are now losing again our greatest resource, another generation raised for export. Forced emigration is back with us, not because of fear, famine or recession but because of the housing emergency, because Deputy O'Brien has been a housing Minister for more of the same and because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael refuse to change. Our people need change like never before and nowhere is this more urgent than in the area of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Let me be clear: this emergency and catastrophe does not have to be this way. I believe, indeed I know, that with the right policies, housing can be fixed. I believe that the homes our people need can be delivered and that we can give this generation the chance to build a good life here in Ireland, but that means the largest social and affordable housing programme the State has ever seen. It means cutting rents by putting one month's rent back into tenants' pockets and banning rent increases for at least three years, backed up by a far more ambitious tenant <i>in situ</i> scheme. It means a real strategy for bringing thousands of vacant and derelict homes back into use. It means an emergency plan to reduce the numbers of people and families presenting as homeless and speed up people's exit from emergency accommodation. These are the ambitious actions our people need. That is what a Sinn Féin-led Government would deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Ba mhór an tubaiste í feidhmeannas an Teachta Darragh O'Brien mar Aire Tithíochta, Rialtais Áitiúil agus Oidhreachta.

Tá an géarchéim tithíochta chomh scaipthe anois go bhfuil sé ag cur isteach ar chúram sláinte, ar oideachas agus ar an ngeilleagar. Is leor sin. Caithfidh an tAire imeacht agus ba cheart don Rialtas teipthe seo a mhálaí a phacáil leis. Tá olltoghchán ag teastáil uainn.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> The Minister has been in office for two and a half years, that is, two and a half years too long because on every level by which we might judge the performance of a housing Minister, he has failed to get the job done. In any other job or walk of life, he would have been sacked by now. He needs to go. Nevertheless, this goes far beyond one Minister. The longer Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are in power, the worse the housing crisis will get. Housing was the test for the Government, and three years on from the election, it has failed that test spectacularly. The housing crisis is now so bad it is undermining our health system, our education system and the economy while also pushing another generation of young Irish people to emigrate. Our people simply cannot afford for this mess to go on any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Not only do we need a change of housing Minister, but we need a change of government. We need a general election.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_679">Yesterday, I had a phone conversation with an incredibly distraught family in County Kildare. Their son Wayne is sleeping tonight in a tent in County Meath. Wayne suffers from very extreme mental health challenges in his life and he has been homeless for about two years. Since I and my colleague Deputy O'Rourke have been working with this family, we have found that there is simply no emergency accommodation either in Meath or in Kildare that meets this very vulnerable man's needs. The real concern of the family is not just the impact on his health. Given the temperatures on our streets this week, this young man's life is at risk. I do not say that as an idle throwaway comment. Over the last two days we have read newspaper reports of a young woman who had been sleeping rough in my constituency in Clondalkin and who tragically died at the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> Why is this happening? The answer is very straightforward. It is happening because the Government's housing plan is failing. It is happening because the policies the Taoiseach and the man beside him have been implementing for six years are failing. Let us look at the plan. Social and affordable housing targets are way below what is needed and they are not being met year on year. Homelessness is at levels we never thought possible. The current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage called for his predecessor to resign when homelessness was approaching 10,000. Today, it is 11,500 men, women and children on his watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> While the Taoiseach will deflect and claim it is always somebody else's fault, he should read Friday's ESRI report. It states two very simple things. It states that the plan the Taoiseach so eloquently celebrated only moments ago will not meet its own targets over the medium term. The ESRI has called on the Government to implement the very policy proposals we have been outlining for years: to dramatically increase direct State investment in social and affordable homes; take real action on vacancy; use new methods of building construction; and take action on land management. These are things the Government talks about doing but never does.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Until recently, every time a Government Member spoke, they told us of increases in planning permissions, commencements and new homes. That is not what the data now indicate. Every major report for months has shown that commencements are down, planning permissions are down and next year's and the following years' targets will not be met. I do not know how the Taoiseach can stand here and blame anybody in the Opposition for the failure of him and his Government's housing plan over the past six years. Shame on him.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I say to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that the level of frustration and anger we feel is not only because we have a disagreement on policy. It is because of the real human stories we hear week in and week out from the victims and survivors of the Government's housing policy who come to us for help. That is why everybody on this side of the House will reflect on those. Let us be very clear, despite the Taoiseach's misdirection and misrepresentation and despite his blaming of everybody else, his plan, his Minister and his Government are failing. That is why Wayne's life is at risk tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> I make no apology for saying I have no confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is nothing to do with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as a person. It has to do with the policies that he and the Government have been pursuing for years. They caused this crisis. They are making this crisis worse. Only a change of government, a change of Minister and a change of housing plan will allow us to finally bring about an end to the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael housing catastrophe.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">People Before Profit's policy states that it is critical that we break immediately from the failed living-with-Covid strategy and implement a strategy based on elimination - the Chinese approach. This would have our economy in shutdown for a third Christmas. Construction sites would be abandoned and we would deprive people of their basic liberties for far too long. Fewer houses would have been built in the past year under People Before Profit, if any would have been built at all. I accept that a left-wing government would mean radical change; radical change for the worse for the vast majority of people. It would involve a self-defeating retreat from Europe and the world in pursuit of an ideological experiment that has brought misery and oppression to every country that has tried it.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I acknowledge that we have much more work to do, especially on housing, but the Government has helped our economy and society emerge strong from Brexit, Covid and the war in Ukraine. A record number of people are in work in Ireland at the moment. Trade and investment are at record levels. Notwithstanding inflation and rising incomes, we are generating budget surpluses due to prudent management of the public finances. We are using that money to help families and businesses with rising energy costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I know the Government needs to do much more on housing in the next two years. It needs to be a whole-of-government approach and it will be. It is a crisis that cuts across all age groups and one that demands results as well as actions. The no-confidence motion was heavy on analysis but light on solutions. There was not even one proposal as to how we could build houses more quickly. It is easy to invent slogans and raise targets but much harder to design and execute solutions. In Housing for All we have a plan that is thought through with a series of actions that complement one another.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> We are providing grants to help people renovate old buildings and breathe new life into them, thus creating new homes in towns, villages and rural areas throughout the country. Well over 35,000 first-time buyers, singles and couples, have benefited from the help-to-buy scheme and we have extended the scheme for another two years. We are helping thousands of first-time buyers to bridge the gap between their deposit and the mortgage they can get, and the price of a new home through the first-home scheme. Some 16,000 individuals, couples and families have bought their first home in the past year. That is the highest in 15 years and we want it to be higher still. These people would not have been helped to buy if those in People Before Profit had their way. They want to take away the help-to-buy scheme and they do not believe in the first-home scheme. They want a State-sponsored rent-for-life model of housing, not one based on homeownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Our mission for the remainder of this Government is to turn the corner on housing for everyone - renters, first-time buyers, those experiencing homelessness and those in need of more suitable accommodation. Our mission is to restore the social contract and to make home ownership affordable for the many again. We will build more houses and apartments and get more people living in suitable, affordable accommodation. We will build even more social housing because it benefits everyone. It takes people off the housing list, frees up private rental properties for others and puts downward pressure on rents and house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> We should not forget that 8,000 or 9,000 new social homes will be provided this year, which could be the highest in one year in the history of our State. People hark back to the 1970s, 1980s, the 1920s, the 1940s and the 1960s, periods when they believe the State was building more social housing; that is not the case. Through local authorities, approved housing bodies and other mechanisms, we are providing more social housing than has been the case for a very long time. We will also scale up our cost-rental programme as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I want to finish by paying tribute to the Minister, Deputy O’Brien. I know him since our days on Fingal County Council in the 2000s. We both got elected to this House in 2007 but I have only had the chance to work closely with him since 2020 when this Government was formed. I know him to be a tireless worker, pleasant and approachable, and always available to take a phone call. He is a good man, a man who cares, and a man who is doing everything he can to turn this situation around. He played an instrumental role in the programme for Government negotiations after the general election, helping to form this historic three-party coalition, while others in the Opposition barely even tried to put together an alternative and organised a range of public meetings instead. Tough as it is, Darragh did not hesitate in taking on the role of Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and he, like all of us, has more to do. I know he will be undeterred by tonight’s motion and will be back at his desk this evening working on how we can shift the momentum on housing and help people through this difficult winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I commend this motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">The construct of the no-confidence motion put forward by Solidarity-People Before Profit leads us here today. This is a motion that is disingenuous and wide of the mark. The fantasy it purports is of the removal from office of one of our most capable Ministers one year into a ten-year strategy, which has seen some 28,000 units built, which is a fact and is not fiction, and is the highest number built since 2008. There are more than 16,000 first-time buyers, which is also a fact and is not fiction, and it is also the highest number since 2008. The idea is this motion will somehow magically solve our housing challenges. Those supporting the motion took to the airwaves over the weekend to engage in their usual populist sloganeering, fighting the need for fundamental change. Are Solidarity-People Before Profit seriously suggesting that to increase supply as quickly as possible, we should stop what we are doing, which is implementing the single most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State with unprecedented levels of multi-annual funding, and start all over again?</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Let us talk about what is happening in Waterford under Housing for All. Should we stop the repair and lease scheme, under which 71 residential housing units for older people have been delivered in the former St Joseph’s Convent, which is inner-city living for inner-city people, appropriate to their needs and with the wraparound supports those people need? The completion date for this project is in the first quarter of 2023. Let us talk about affordable purchase delivery at Mount Neil, Carrickpherish, where there are 32 affordable purchase houses with a completion date of the first quarter of 2023. Deerpark, Williamstown has 25 affordable houses with a completion date of the fourth quarter of 2022. Summerfields, Kilbarry has 62 affordable units in two phases, both of which are to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Let us talk about price. The projected sale price will be between €214,000 and €243,000 per affordable unit. That is delivery, that is Housing for All, and that is what is happening the length and breadth of the country. It may not be happening quickly enough but it is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> The Opposition continues to call for a general election and for a new government to solve the housing crisis. In reality, many of the Opposition parties shirk from the challenge of office in the wake of 2016 and 2020-----</p>

Its Members voted against the first ever Affordable Housing Bill, the Land Development Agency Bill, which aimed to build social and affordable houses on State land, and against important planning legislation. They opposed the help-to-buy scheme, the first home scheme and the vacancy grant scheme. The list is endless. That party should give the people more credit.

          <p eId="para_710">I have no confidence in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in government to tackle the housing crisis. For ten years, from 2011 to 2021, we have had a lost decade in my home county of Donegal. There has been almost zero public housing built on public lands. Instead, the Government forces thousands of families into private rental accommodation and, of course, that takes us to a very significant increase in the cost of rent in Donegal which people just cannot afford. Families are emigrating to Australia and Canada, not because they do not have work but because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads. The dream of owning their own homes is not attainable. That is the story throughout all of Ireland and is not unique to Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> What makes this worse is the defective concrete blocks crisis. We have a perfect storm in Donegal. We have all of the elements of the housing crisis we have in the rest of the State, and then this defective blocks crisis. The Minister knows very well these families had to have an uprising after the disgraceful and discredited 90-10 scheme. Twice they came to Dublin in very significant numbers, where 20,000 were estimated to be present at the second protest. These were very significant numbers from Donegal, Mayo, Clare and the west. The responsibility was on the Minister and his Government to deliver a scheme that gave them justice. These are traumatised families, people whose lives have been destroyed and who are victims of the scandalous system of regulation of the construction industry in this country. They are victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I will never forget the campaigners in the Public Gallery last July. They were absolutely distraught. They were betrayed. They had engaged in good faith with the Government to arrive at a scheme which was just and fair. They wanted 100% redress. They had proposals that would have cost the Government and the State nothing and which made complete sense. They had 80 amendments but the Minister ran the legislation through because he said it was urgent to have a scheme which people could work with. Here we are now, almost at Christmas, and we still do not have a scheme and it is still not in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> What we have, however, is the spectacle of a Government party Senator making completely outrageous comments in the other House last week, attacking the traumatised families and the victims and talking about a good scheme which nobody in Donegal believes in. It is no wonder, when you hear his comments, that we can see the failure of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> It is not just a matter of the Minister himself. I have no confidence in Fine Gael and in Fianna Fáil to do what is right by our people when it comes to housing based on lived experience.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">I have no doubt it was said the Minister is working hard, and we are not disputing that, because I do not really know. What I do know is it is absolutely not working for the people in Mayo. To say we are doing our best is difficult to listen to because the Government designed the system that is not working, in the form of the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and everything else, and by privatising the very thing people need, which is their shelter and the roof over their heads. This area was privatised under the Government and it must now own that decision.</p>

He named out all of his friends on the local football team and said it is very unlikely - some of the Members present know what football team that is - that they will be able to field a team next year because they will have to emigrate. So many people young people are forced to emigrate because they do not have a roof over their head.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The great tragedy for the Minister is that he and the people sitting beside him do not even realise this. They do not realise how bad the emergency is. Some of the Members there are smiling and that is just absolutely shocking.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I have nothing against the Minister personally but I have something against his policies and plans because they have not worked. He has been in office for two and half years and I have listened to everyone describe all that the Government has done. I will tell this Government about families. A lady contacted me, a mother and grandmother, who cannot close the door of her bedroom because she has had to put another bed in there to put her grandchild in because her daughter has nowhere to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I know another lady who does not smoke or party and works hard. She has a lovely home but has received a notice to quit. In April, her and her four-year-old daughter will be homeless. That is why we have no confidence in the Minister. His plans do not work. The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, spoke about facts or fiction. In Cork, in January 2000 Fianna Fáil councillors voted against social housing on the Skehard Road. That is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">Housing is the foundation on which a decent and functioning society is built. Precarious housing leads to precarious lives. For this and the previous Fianna Fáil supported Government's abject failure on housing, the citizens of Ireland and our society and economy will pay a severe price. I do not want to be flippant or in any way dismissive given the seriousness of the crisis we now face but, quite frankly, I have more faith and confidence in Santa Claus than I do in the Government to fix the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The housing catastrophe we are experiencing is on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We have seen seven years of wasted prosperity and two failed plans to build the private, public, voluntary and affordable homes we need. We have a rental market in chaos. Home ownership is beyond the grasp of many people who are educated, skilled and work hard for a living. Funds are competing with first-time buyers and councils, soaking up good homes off the plans. To our eternal shame, this Christmas 11,000 people, including children, are paying the ultimate price. They are homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> By any objective measurement, the Minister's plan is failing. In any job, the basic metric should be whether things are going better than when the person first took on the job. They manifestly are not. They are, in fact, getting worse. Unfortunately, the Minister holds some records, not the kind he is likely to pin to the wall. We have the highest rents ever recorded. We have the record for the highest house prices and the highest numbers of people who are homeless. In life and in business, when one is in a job and the plan is not working, one either steps down or changes the plan. One has the humility to change the plan. The Minister is prepared to do neither. For that, this Government will pay a heavy price.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> These are not just political charges that we expect to see in the Chamber in the course of our business. Rather, it is the harsh, cold truth. The truth is that the numbers are only going in one direction. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, referenced Waterford earlier and did so selectively. In Louth the reality is that house prices have gone up by 7% in the past year. There is planning permission in place for 11,000 new homes, but only 1,282 are still under construction or expected to be completed this year. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic and before the Minister's plan, there were 1,076 completions. That was before Housing for All, yet we still say that Housing for All is a success. Just over 10% of all permissions in place and a fraction of what is needed to house people is being built this year. There have been 41% fewer permissions granted across Ireland in the third quarter of this year than in the same period of 2021. They are not my figures; they are figures from the CSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Rents are up 13%, if people can find a place at all. The reality for the people I represent is ten to 12 years on the housing list. That is the reality of life in Louth and the lived experience for too many across the country in 2022. Yet, the Government still sticks to a plan that is not working, indifferent to all of the warning signs from the Opposition and independent experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Housing for All has many of the fundamental design flaws of Fine Gael's Rebuilding Ireland, a plan that Fianna Fáil, in terms of confidence and supply, supported. There was a massive over-reliance on private developers to solve a problem that only the State has the scale, authority, mandate, capacity and resources ultimately to crack. Even as developers, in particular apartment developers, make it clear that they do not have the finance and are getting out of the game, the Government still sticks to its Housing for All plans and metrics and fails to change tack fundamentally to wrap up what we need to do, namely build social and affordable homes on publicly owned land by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> When supply in the private market slows, the Government looks for scapegoats. That is what is happening. Residents' associations are using their constitutional right to take a judicial review, for example, a right Government now wants to deprive certain citizens and bodies of. There is a rush to reform - I use that term advisedly - An Bord Pleanála, a body badly in need of reform but not in the rushed way the Government plans. The Government wants to limit Part 8 powers for local authority members and local authorities more generally. This sounds to me like a solution in search of a problem, if I ever saw one. We all saw this coming. We knew that putting most of our eggs in the private sector basket was a Hail Mary strategy. That is why the Labour Party, in our costed budget launched last September, said that we should spend an extra €1.5 billion on public housing next year and scale up its ambition on cost rental. The truth is that anything positive and progressive the Minister might have done on his watch in terms of housing was done because he had to be carried, kicking screaming, and led by the Opposition to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I refer to the winter eviction ban, something the Government simply refused to introduce. It was dragged kicking and screaming to introduce it this year. It introduced an increase to the income threshold for social housing, restrictions on AirBnBs and the tenant <i>in situ</i> scheme, which has worked well, where it has worked, for HAP tenants who are at risk of homelessness and landlords who are selling up. The Government increased stamp duty on buying multiple units in housing developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> In all of those circumstances, the Minister and his ministerial colleagues had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the Opposition to do the right, practical, pragmatic and constructive thing. We in the Labour Party are doing our best to be constructive with the Minister, but he is sometimes making that very difficult. It is his policy that we have a problem with, not him.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> The Minister will survive today's vote because the Government has the numbers and this is a numbers game. However, the plan should not survive this vote. The very least the Minister should do is have the humility to change his plan. It is a plan that is not working. He should listen to the constructive proposals being provided by the Opposition today. The Minister must change his plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">It is notable how little time the Government has spent defending its record on housing. Instead, it has used most of the time to talk about any other issue or attack the Opposition. That says a lot. Someone who contacted me yesterday said, regarding the motion of confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_736">I am 45 in January and I am living back in my childhood bedroom. I have zero chance of ever getting a home of my own. I'll be homeless when my parents pass. I work and have two children, but I cannot afford to rent anywhere. Homelessness numbers will only rise daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">There is no doubt that when it comes to ensuring people can access housing they can afford, the Government and Minister are failing terribly. Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party who are voting confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are backing a Government with the worst record of any in the history of the State on housing. They are voting confidence in rents, house prices and homelessness at record levels. They are voting confidence in a housing system where rents have never been so unaffordable. Rents are now much higher than mortgage payments and have increased by a staggering 85% in 2010 compared to an average increase across the European Union of just 18% in that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> They are voting confidence in a Minister presiding over a situation where there are now 11,397 people living in homeless emergency accommodation. In the past year, homelessness has increased by 29% and child homelessness by a shocking 38%. Some 3,480 children will spend this Christmas in emergency accommodation. They are voting confidence in a Minister who is failing people in their 20s and into their 30s and beyond who are still living in their childhood bedrooms. An entire generation feels left behind and simply wants to be able to get on with their lives, move out and be independent. A generation is giving up hope of ever being able to afford somewhere to live and is asking themselves if emigration is the only option.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> They are voting confidence in a crisis in our schools with teacher shortages and a crisis in healthcare with shortages of key workers caused by the housing disaster. There is a crisis across all sectors of Irish society where positions cannot be filled as people cannot find somewhere affordable to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> They are voting confidence in a rental system full of loopholes and get-out clauses exploited by landlords. Rent regulation excludes large parts of the country, leaving renters subject to massive rent increases and a system that allows landlords to carry out mass evictions of renters, as is happening in Tathony House, Rathmines and other locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> They are voting confidence in a collapse in levels of homeownership among adults of prime working age and in a Government that promotes build-to-rent so heavily that only a minority of new-build homes are available to people to buy on the open market.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> They are voting confidence in a Minister who never misses an opportunity to use more and more public money to provide subsidies for developers and a Government that is now spending more than €1 billion a year on long-term leasing sweetheart deals and other rent subsidies that push up rents, making them ever more unaffordable. They are voting confidence in a Government that is somehow leaving millions of euro allocated to build new homes unspent, a Government whose capital underspend in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was €702 million at the end of November and a Minister who has reallocated elsewhere €337 million that was earmarked to build new local authority homes this year. How is that possible in the middle of a housing disaster?</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Government party Deputies supporting the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are voting confidence in a decline in the number of new homes getting built, with commencement notices for new homes 14% down on last year. They are voting confidence in a Government that allows developers to sit on planning permissions, hoard land and drip-feed housing supply to ensure the prices of homes become ever more unaffordable. There are 80,000 planning permissions around Ireland that are not activated.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Deputies supporting the Minister are voting confidence in a Government that has failed to tackle the shortage of skilled construction workers and failed to encourage enough apprenticeships in key construction trades. The number of apprenticeships in bricklaying is just 31% of the 2006 number, while the number of apprenticeships in plastering is just 17% of the 2006 number.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Deputies supporting the Minister are voting confidence in a Minister interested more in spin than in delivering the homes people need. They are voting confidence in a Government that forever tells us what it is going to do about housing in the future but cannot stand over the record of what it has done. They are voting confidence in a Minister that keeps missing the targets he has set himself on delivery of affordable, cost rental and social homes. They are voting confidence in a Government that is congratulating itself that 28,000 new homes will be completed this year when even the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage admits we need at least 42,000 new homes each and every year. Deputies who back the Minister are voting confidence in a Government that has blown the chance to borrow billions at historically low interest rates to invest in building the tens of thousands of public homes we need and a Government that has failed to make the most of the suspension of the EU fiscal rules to invest in much-needed social and affordable homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> There may well be a majority in this Dáil that will vote confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but they should make no mistake that, outside in the real world, where people are paying higher and higher rents, living in constant fear of becoming homeless and worrying if they will ever be able to afford a place of their own that they can call home, there is no confidence in this Minister or in this Government on housing. There is only despair, a lack of hope and the constant worry of how this housing disaster is impacting people's children and families and across society. That is what we must change.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I will vote confidence in the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, this evening, and not just because of his incredible dedication to his role, his resilience, and the effort he puts into making a difference to all that this Government wants to do better. I will vote confidence in him not just because of those qualities, which I see regularly. I will vote confidence in him because of the difference I see him make, including in my constituency and my part of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> A list is not the most attractive part of any speech, particularly in a debate like this, but the following is a list that must go on the record of the Dáil this evening. It is a list of new homes, a list of differences being made, and a list of examples of delivery of Housing for All in which the Minister is playing a critical role: Sean Foster Place, 30 homes; Dominic Street, 70 homes; O'Devaney Gardens, 56 homes; Dorset Street, 63 homes; St. Finbar's Court, 46 homes; and Infirmary Road, 38 homes. They are not homes being delivered by some unbridled free market, to which Deputy McDonald made reference earlier. They are homes being built by Dublin City Council and into which families and tenants who need homes are being moved. I experience and see the same pressure, to which many Deputies have made reference, in our citizens who need more homes and in those who come to our clinics worried about their rent or about where they will live. The lived experience to which Deputies refer, which we on this side of the House experience as well in our clinics and in the work we do, is also to a degree matched by the reality of the homes I see being built and the families and the tenants who are moving into them.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">-----a plan we know needs to do better and a plan we know needs to deliver more, and it will due to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the commitment and work of this Government. In contrast, we have an Opposition, especially a Sinn Féin Opposition, which says it wants to build more homes and to deliver more rental accommodation when it has turned landlords, developers and banks into terms of abuse. That is what they are in the Opposition's lexicon.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">That is what they are in the Opposition's world. The people we need to build more homes, the people to whom we need to lend more to get those homes built, those we need to come back in to provide rental accommodation, in the Opposition's world, are terms of abuse and have been throughout this Dáil and before. When the Opposition then says it will spend more and build more, with what money will it do so, and from where? Is it the corporate tax revenues that everybody is warning us we should not spend?</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Is it the corporate tax from the companies whose executives it does not want here and whose workers it wants to tax more and whose data centres it wants to run out of this country? </p>
          <p eId="para_774"> We know that much more needs to be done. We know we need to make a difference but in Housing for All and in the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, we have a plan that is making a difference that is making a difference in my constituency, in my part of Dublin and is doing the same the length and breadth of this country. </p>

          <p eId="para_776">I will try to get through it. People Before Profit-Solidarity tabled a no-confidence motion in the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, thinking it would get some easy media headlines with some cheap digs at this Government. It is a tired, cynical game, which is straight out of the Sinn Féin populist play book. It is being seen for what it is: a stunt that will not see a single house built. It has no solutions, no ideas and no legislation. Housing and delivery on housing is the number one issue for this Government. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and this Government have already introduced a raft of actions to increase supply and will produce more in the coming days. All in all, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has passed 17 pieces of legislation over the past two years across areas as varied as the winter eviction ban to protect renters, new strategic approaches to delivery, enhancing affordability and 11 of those legislative items were completed this year alone. Just last night, I saw the Minister engaging with homeowners who were impacted by defects. I saw a Minister who is absolutely sincere, who understands the issues and is dedicated to seeing follow-through. For people out there, I want to set out the fundamental difference in approach between this Government and the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> People Before Profit-Solidarity and Sinn Féin want to pull the wool over the eyes of those seeking to buy their own homes. They do not want them to know that the State is now the biggest actor in housing when it comes to affordability and social housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">Sinn Féin has also proposed a tax credit for renters and proposed an outline cost of €300 million when it cost €600 million. Again an uncosted plan that is not credible. People do not accept the interventions by the Minister around protecting renters and around increasing supply and driving affordability of housing. They do not recognise that Part V has been increased to 20% or the progression of a residential land-zone tax, as well as a vacant homes tax. These are the facts rather than the ongoing rhetoric. They want to cut the legs from private supply at a time when every avenue must operate in tandem. Those who need housing right now want delivery not dogma.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">Housing was a real test for this Government and almost three years from the general election, it has failed and failed spectacularly. Its inability and continued failures are so bad that they are undermining our health and education systems and are undermining our businesses, while pushing another generation to emigrate. Affordability has gone through the roof. Today a three-bedroom house in Edgeworthstown will set someone back €1,500 a month. That is in Longford, a county that did not qualify for an affordable housing scheme. In County Westmeath, it is €1,800 in Athlone for a two-bed, €1,600 in Mullingar where a so-called affordable housing scheme listed properties more expensive than 75% of similar properties on the market. I could go on and on. I could go on with the ever-growing list of young buyers pleading for help to get a home; the principal with a woodwork teacher living in their box room; the renting grandparent under notice to quit moving into their adult children's home. Yet during this time there was a Minister who was borderline gaslighting the public with statements that there was no housing crisis, that the plan is building momentum and that people just do not feel it yet as if it is somehow their problem and not the problem of failed policies. All the photo opportunities and glossy brochures produced by the Minister will not deflect from the cold hard fact that he is failing miserably. If he picks up a Goodbody Stockbrokers report or an ESRI report, it will show that commencements are down, planning applications are down and all the while there is a capital underspend. Is it any wonder that so many people across the country have never been more pessimistic about owning a home? The longer Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are in government, the worse this housing crisis is going to get.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">It is incredible to hear the Taoiseach suggest that when he hears anger from the Opposition on the issue of housing, it is rehearsed anger. If I ever needed any more clarity of the Government's attitude towards housing and how it simply does not get it, it was from the Taoiseach here tonight. I heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is also missing, suggest that Opposition parties are engaging in divisory politics; that it is old versus young; urban versus rural. If this Government has done anything, it is to unite people in urban and rural areas and older and younger people all under the same issue of not being able to access secure and affordable housing. It is impacting the people in our cities and rural areas and it is even impacting people on our offshore islands. It is not just impacting young people. It is seriously impacting older people. I see people coming into my clinic in their 50s, 60s and 70s who cannot access housing. A man who is nearly 70 was paying over €1,000 extra over HAP. He knows that once he retires, he will not be able to afford that any more. There was a week in Galway city when six households were turned away from emergency accommodation. That resulted in six people having to live in their cars and three in tents. Coming up to Christmas, there is no room in the inn for Galway city homeless and there certainly are no wise men in this Government who are going to do anything about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">I have 11,397 reasons I have no confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. This is the number of homeless people who were in emergency accommodation in October. Many more are sleeping rough tonight on the streets of this capital and of towns right across the State. This winter, the past week of which has brought even more untold hardship, suffering and death on our streets, the housing emergency, crisis and debacle that the Minister oversees as the member of the Government responsible for housing is soul-destroying. Generations of ordinary people have been locked out of homeownership. Rents, which are among the highest in Europe, are leaching the lifeblood out of our young people. In the past 12 years, rents have risen by over 85% by comparison with the EU average of 18%.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> My county, Wicklow, which has the highest rents in the country outside Dublin, has witnessed a year-on-year rent increase of 16.6%. Rents are rising at the highest rate since the height of the Celtic tiger era. This equates to an average cost of €1,846 per month for ordinary people to fork out in a crushing cost-of-living crisis. This is a measure of the Minister’s failure; a failure that continues to ruin the lives of many people right across the State. It is time for the Minister to go. In fact, it is time for the entire Government to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">People Before Profit’s no-confidence motion had nothing to do with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, as an individual. It had nothing to do with cynicism and certainly was not a stunt. Rather, it was a desperate attempt to force the Government to acknowledge its housing policies are failing thousands upon thousands of real human beings in the most terrible way. It is about more than 3,000 children who are going to spend Christmas in emergency accommodation, some for the second, third or fourth time. It is about the fact that 100,000 families and individuals are on housing waiting lists in desperate circumstances, waiting a decade or sometimes up to 20 years for a secure, affordable roof over their heads. It is about the fact that thousands of people are facing the imminent prospect of being evicted from their homes even though the Government claimed it protected them. It is about the fact that four Dublin city councils did not add a single new council house to the public housing stock in the first half of this year, despite the fact that we are facing an unprecedented housing crisis. It is about the fact that the Government has failed to spend €750 million when facing this absolute catastrophe, affecting children, families and individuals, including workers, at the wrong end of this housing crisis. That is why we submitted our motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Of course, to ensure we could not present our alternative proposals, which we have done time and again, the Government tabled its own motion. This means People Before Profit has but six and a half minutes to make its case. If our motion had been allowed, we would have had 40 minutes. Instead, we have the cacophony of people standing up to say how wonderful Government policy is and how well it is working. That is typical of the manipulation and spin that occur when dealing with an absolute catastrophe facing families.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Let me give a couple of examples of those who really matter. Jacqueline and Richard, a couple in their 50s with two teenage children, rang me on Thursday bawling crying because they got a notice stating they will be in court in February, when there is supposed to be an eviction ban. They are to be thrown out of the house where they have lived all their lives. They are working people who have paid their taxes. Nothing the Government has done will protect them or provide them with a home. They are terrified they will be in a car. Jacqueline is terrified that Richard will literally not survive this.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> Our motion was also about a woman of 55 who is on dialysis for nine hours per day. She submitted an application for housing priority on medical grounds last November but the authorities are still looking for additional medical information, without which they will not process it. It is about a 73-year-old man with a spinal condition who is sleeping on his daughter’s couch. Despite his situation, the council is looking for more information about his health. It is about a 59-year-old man with Alzheimer’s disease who has been in seven different housing assistance payment tenancies in nine years although doctors have said specifically that he needs a secure, affordable place where he will not be moving around. That is what is going on. These things have been said time and again to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> During the summer, we tabled a motion to reduce rents, just as we put forward Bills to do so. We introduced the right-to-housing Bill, a Bill to stop evictions where there is no fault or where people are being evicted on grounds of sale, use-it-or-use-it policies, and measures to establish a State construction company to accelerate the delivery of public housing on affordable land, but the Government voted against them all. Why? If we ponder the fact that Cairn Homes’ profit increased by 129% last year and Irish Residential Properties REIT, the biggest landlord in the country, is making a profit of 50% on every tenant, we will have some idea of what is really going on.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">Three and a half thousand children are forced to spend Christmas in emergency accommodation, some for the second Christmas, some for the third and some even for the fourth. It costs €20,000 per year to rent a house in Cork city and €25,000 per year in Dublin. The price of a house has gone up by more in one year than the annual wage of many a young worker. A generation of young people cannot afford to buy or rent and are forced to live at home with their parents or emigrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Could the Minister answer a couple of questions? Why, when apartment starts were down 29% in the three months up to October and housing starts are down 23%, does the Minister not step up public housebuilding and make a case for it to be key? Why does he not shut down the nonsense of gifting developers more tax breaks? Why did he appoint an individual to the board of the Housing Finance Agency when the Standards in Public Office Commission made a significant ruling against that person? I have no confidence that the Minister, the rest of the Government and the capitalist market will solve the housing crisis. They are all part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</p>

I do so because I see every day the work he is doing. I know he absolutely cares about the people affected by the homelessness crisis, the people struggling with rents and the people who aspire to homeownership. I also know he cares about those who are now being placed in housing because of the massive increase in homebuilding the State is engaging in, those who are now benefiting from new cost-rental homes for the first time in the history of our State.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I know the Minister cares about all of those who are now applying for, and successfully achieving, affordable housing for the first time in this country in well over a decade.

          <p eId="para_841">I work closely with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, every single day. He works harder than anyone in this House to address and tackle the housing crisis. That is the truth. He has secured an extra €11 billion for housing in the national development plan out to 2030. In 2016 the housing capital budget was €435 million. In 2020 it was €1.4 billion. Next year it will be €2.3 billion, added to by the Land Development Agency, and the work of the Housing Finance Agency. In 2016, 604 social houses were built in this country. The last Government increased investment and increased the number of homes that were being built. Last year there were more than 5,200 new direct build homes, in terms of social housing. When we add acquisitions and leases, more than 9,200 homes were added to the public housing stock despite Covid 19. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has delivered a range of new affordable housing through measures that have been put in place, such as, a new affordable housing fund; a new affordable housing grant of €150,000 per unit for cost rental units; the extension of the help-to-buy scheme by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe; the Land Development Agency has now been put on a statutory footing; and we have a first-home shared equity scheme up and running. If they were to tell the truth, Opposition parties simply do not believe in home ownership. They have come up with affordable housing schemes where the applicants would never actually own the house. We have a rapidly growing population in Ireland. Despite all of the Opposition's attempts to portray Ireland as some kind of a failed State, why is it that people from all over the world want to come to our country to live, to build their lives and to build their careers? Since 2015, Ireland has had net inward migration every single year, long before the war in Ukraine and long before the international protection crisis. This year we will have net inward migration of more than 61,000 people. Ireland's population is up by more than half a million people since 2011. This underlines the scale of the challenge we face.

          <p eId="para_847">The Opposition never talks about the hard yards, the issues that are actually involved in delivering housing supply, such as, the reforms to the planning system; access to affordable finance; the apprenticeship system; tackling materials inflation; land availability; and access to private capital. If we want to deliver 33,000 homes per year, and the Opposition says we need more than that, then we need at least €7.5 billion in private capital to complement what the State is doing. The truth is the Opposition is hostile to private investment and hostile to the market. The Opposition thinks we can just say we will build 20,000 social and affordable homes and it will happen just like that. The Opposition says it would spend all of the money we have. We have that money because we did not pursue the anti-enterprise policies advocated by the Opposition, because we did not oppose every EU treaty, and because we did not oppose every free-trade agreement this country signed up to. Were we to do that we would not have the resources the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Government are using to tackle this housing crisis in the best and most effective way we possibly can.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">When this Government took office it was made clear that delivery on housing would be our number one priority. At a time of global upheaval, be that with Covid, the cost-of-living pressures, or the war in Ukraine, the Government has sought to deliver on that, led by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. We did not, nor do we, underestimate the challenges involved, nor do we underestimate the awful impact the housing crisis has on so many of our citizens. This is why the Government is working to deliver on our commitment to provide social housing, to provide affordable housing, and to provide affordable rental. There cannot be any end to the challenge we face in housing until we see an increase in supply, and supply is now increasing. To the end of September, more than 55,000 homes were either commenced or completed. I see this in my own constituency. Only one month ago, the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, I and others, saw already under construction the first phase of the Church Fields development, built by Fingal County Council and funded by a huge capital investment secured by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. That will deliver more than 300 social, affordable and cost rental homes in the middle of my constituency. These positive developments are not just happening in Dublin West. Work has already commenced on the largest public housing scheme in the State, in Shanganagh, in Shankill in County Dublin. The Shanganagh development will deliver 597 social and affordable homes. The first of these will be the completed in 2024. Importantly, more than half of these homes will be cost rental. Cost rental is a viable new form of tenancy in Ireland that was introduced by this Government. A total of 900 cost-rental homes have been approved in Ireland in just over one year since the Affordable Housing Act was enacted, providing the basis for this new sector. By 2030 we aim to have 18,000 cost-rental homes in the State. The introduction of cost rental as a new form of tenure will be one of the most important legacies introduced by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> I will conclude on a final point. Through managing the housing crisis we have, of course, had to manage the crisis created by the war in Ukraine and the real pressures provided in housing and services by the arrival of more than 71,000 people to our country. Throughout that, I recognise the work the Minister, Deputy O'Brien has done in supporting my Government and for being a staunch voice in support of our Ukraine response, whether it be setting up community fora, resourcing a director of services for the Ukraine response in every local authority across the country, mobilising rest centres, working on pledged properties, or working on the refurbishment of institutional buildings. On top of the huge challenges faced by his Department, and the huge challenges the Minister is rising to in delivering housing and responding to the crisis, the Minister, has assisted the huge work the Government is doing on Ukraine. I express my thanks to him. I know that work will continue with him in his role as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">If I was to be politically brutally honest I would say that one of Fianna Fáil's mistakes in recent years was to extend the confidence and supply agreement beyond three years. It was probably compounded when we voted confidence in that Government's housing Minister and its housing policy. It did, of course, allow the Opposition the opportunity to portray Fianna Fáil as compliant and complicit in Fine Gael's and Labour's policies since 2011. As we all know, that simply was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Despite that misrepresentation, we emerged from the election as the largest party with a responsibility to form a Government. We sought to do so and to put in place a programme for Government, while the Opposition ran for the hills when this country needed to overhaul housing policy. That programme for Government prioritised housing. Fianna Fáil insisted on the portfolio of housing. Its responsibility to deliver on a need was offered and afforded to Darragh O'Brien. As Minister he has enacted 22 Acts to date, more than his three predecessors. As was said already by many here, we have record funding for Housing for All, affordable schemes when there was none, cost-rental schemes when there was none, first homes schemes when there was none, and a Land Development Agency that will build public housing on public lands, but the Opposition still opposed it. We extended the help-to-buy scheme, introduced the tax credit for renters, and increased the grant aid available for derelict houses from €50,000 to €80,000 in urban and rural areas. The Minister initiated a development land tax that has a use it, lose it, or pay for it clause associated with it. Whether the Opposition likes it or not, the national target has been met. In my county of Offaly, for example, when councillors from all parties and none sought 470 solutions, they got 580. In Tullamore today 500 homes are being built. Have we it sorted and is it solved? Is it likely to be solved in the very near short future? No. We accept, acknowledge and appreciate that. What are we doing today? On the planning logjam, for example, which is unavoidable and is there for anyone to see, moves are afoot to ensure that at times of crisis and emergency Opposition parties and their own supporters do not object to and hold up housing at this time of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> I just heard Deputy Mairéad Farrell mention the wise men and the time of the year that is in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I have listened especially to our colleagues from Sinn Féin and considering its performance in government in the North in recent years, it is akin to the same three wise men getting lost and blaming nobody but the camels.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">Tonight I have witnessed some uncomfortable Members on the Government benches and the lads all know what they have to do. They must defend their man or face an election. That is what has brought them in here because there could not be support for the record of this Minister on those benches. It is either that or the Government Deputies do not hold constituency clinics, answer the phone or look at their emails. If they did they would know what it is like for people out there and they would understand why we are opposing this motion of confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that he knows the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, cares but we are not talking about a compassion deficit; we are talking about a competence deficit. It is not personal; it is about policies. The Government's policies, as delivered by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, are failing on every measure. The Minister is responsible for the highest rents, house prices and levels of homelessness ever seen. He is quite the record-breaker and the evidence of this can be seen in all the parents who are saying goodbye to their adult children in Dublin Airport and in those who will spend their last Christmas with their kids as they head abroad in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> Colleagues should not take my word for it; rather they should listen to what the Minister's constituents say. Breda says she was private renting for almost two-and-a-half years and the house was sold and the tenancy notice validated. She is currently couch surfing on her sister-in-law's sofa in Balbriggan. She is registered with Fingal County Council and has been accepted for social housing but she cannot find anywhere to live. She is going to viewings and doing everything she should but she is till sleeping on a sofa. It is not just individuals who are suffering but it is impacting businesses. Tommy Fanning, the head of strategic policy at IDA Ireland said that the lack of housing "is a major problem". It is not a compassion deficit, therefore; it is a competence deficit, which is why this Minister needs to go. While he is at it, he can take the rest of the Government with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">For all of the bluff and bluster from Government Deputies, they cannot hide from the plain fact that its housing policies and its Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are failing.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> Far from resolving the housing emergency, the Minister denies that there is an emergency at all. The emergency was not of the Minister's making, although his party played a starring role, but he has singularly failed to get to grips with it. On all the parameters that matter to real people, the figures do not lie. We have the highest levels of homelessness since records began and they are getting worse. We have the highest house prices on record and they are getting worse. We have the highest rents in the history of the State and they continue to soar. The Minister has established himself as the Harry Kane of Irish politics; missing targets and missing them wildly. The Minister has an advantage over Mr. Kane, however, because he simply moves the goalposts by setting targets that he knows go nowhere near the level of output that is required to resolve the daily crisis that is the lived housing reality of too many of our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The Members opposite know all of this but no doubt the Minister will receive the support of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies this evening, with some of them probably holding out vain hope of a nod for a position as a Minister of State this Saturday. Make no mistake about it but were this motion to be decided by those trapped in the limbo of emergency accommodation, by Ireland's fleeced renters, by those on social housing lists waiting for years, with many more years of waiting to come, by young people desperately trying to buy their first home or by the thousands of others who have lost hope and have again scattered to the four corners of the world in search of a better life, then there would be no contest. It would be a clear and emphatic no confidence vote in this Government. There would be no confidence in its failed housing policies or this Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I listened to the Taoiseach's speech and he excelled himself in his last week. Before he died the theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking, wrote about the possibility of there being a parallel universe. The Taoiseach's speech represented a parallel universe to the experience of most people living in this country. It is clear that the measure of success or failure for a Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the provision of an adequate number of houses for their people. It is as simple as that. This must be done either through public provision or through a functioning market that can provide those houses. On that basis, the Government is failing severely. It is an incredible situation and it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to say that.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> For this Government to have adequate housing, we need to build 50,000 homes every year for the next ten years and it is miles away from that. Even the target the Government set itself last year, of 28,000 homes, was missed. Therefore, this year the Government reduced the target by 5,000 homes. The most worrying and frightening aspect of this for most people is the current figures on commencement notices and the fact that they are significantly down and likely to remain significantly down for next year. There is a massive human and societal cost to what is happening. We have record homelessness, record local authority housing waiting lists, record rents and record house prices. How could we have confidence in a Government or Minister when that is the result of their work?</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> People are literally dying on the streets because of this in our towns and cities. Aontú has found out that more than 357 people have died on the streets of this capital alone in the last five years, an incredible figure and a national disaster, equivalent to a Boeing 747 crashing. That is just in this city; no other local authority in the State records the number of homeless people who die on the streets. I have asked for that to be done and it still has not been done, which is incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> We have young couples who are putting off having their children because they are living in a box room in their parents' homes. We have young parents who do not see their kids from one end of the week to the other because they are commuting three hours per day because they cannot afford a home close to where they live. We cannot get teachers, gardaí or nurses for our public services because they cannot afford accommodation on the wages they are on. Through all of this, we have a Minister who is not doing what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> We were the only State in Europe where housebuilding was closed for a full quarter during the Covid crisis. We are the only State that has not gotten to grips with the level of vacant homes in the country. It is incredible that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has resisted putting a tax on empty homes for as long as he possibly could. Now there is potentially a vacant homes tax in the offing that is nowhere near significant enough to change the behaviour of those people who are sitting on those homes and watching the prices of those homes increase. We have 160,000 vacant homes according to the statistics. We recently put in a parliamentary question and it showed that 392 homes have applied for the vacant property refurbishment grant. That is an incredible and staggering figure when it is compared with the number of vacant homes there are.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I refer to the direct provision of housing and the fact that 11 local authorities failed to build a single local authority home in the first six months of this year. Three Dublin councils failed to build a single home in the first six months of this year. A total of 647 homes were built in the first six months of this year. That is an incredible response to the enormity of a housing crisis that is bearing down so heavily on people's shoulders. On the reforms it has proceeded with, the Government has been dragged kicking and screaming into implementing them. Airbnbs have been taking homes out of the long-term letting market for so long and it is only now that we are getting to grips with that. We have rent controls, evictions bans and the reform of REITs and institutional investors. Again, these reforms are glacial when they are needed the most, which frustrates me. This Minister is in reverse, he is following the same pattern of the previous Ministers and I cannot support him.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">Deputy Darragh O'Brien took on the role of Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage just over two years ago and on the back of a global pandemic. The pandemic resulted in stalls in construction and the Minister has since had to deal with the triple crises of energy, cost of living and inflation. This is in addition to the war, which has affected the supply of material and labour as well as increasing the number of people seeking asylum.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">These are all outside the Minister's control.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> I acknowledge that planning permissions are down by 41%, the level of housing staff is down and homelessness figures are the highest we have seen. These are all relevant facts. However, another relevant fact is that the overall housing delivery target of 24,600 new homes will be exceeded this year. The first affordable purchase homes in more than a decade will be delivered this year. Hundreds of cost rental tenants are now in safe and secure long-term rental homes, which did not exist a little over a year ago. The biggest overhaul of planning legislation in 20 years is being brought to Cabinet today.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> Cancel culture is rife. I must point out that overhauling an entire Government is not the solution. What then? We scramble to replace a housing Minister or have a new Government. How will this help the people? How will this help solve the homeless problems? Starting from scratch involves going back to square one and being unwilling to wait any time for targets and goals to come to fruition. Goals take time and yes, while you can cherry pick low-hanging fruit for quick gains, long-term plans depend on everything falling into place. Unfortunately, the war has resulted in increased costs and increased migration, which have hindered development and put pressure on our housing system. The Minister has consistently acknowledged that not everyone is feeling this progress yet and that it will take time but progress is being made. The motion is simply opposition for opposition's sake.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The Opposition is saying that our housing system is broken thanks to successive failures of Government policy and they have reached breaking point on the Government's failure to deliver but it has not offered any solution. It has not raised any innovative ideas in debate in the Dáil. What we need are innovative ideas. We need to put our heads together. The Opposition is saying that we need a housing model that delivers housing from the State to meet the needs of people. How would this look? What do they propose? If they really wanted to help the people and not further their own agenda, they would put forward ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Our political alliance does not come first; the people of Ireland must come first. I must hand it to the Minister because he is doing a good job and is open to hearing any innovative ideas such as when I proposed modular homes in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago. We have had numerous discussions on this and have since set a date for him to visit Dundalk and meet the developer. We need to stop playing political football and put our heads together to resolve homelessness and come up with innovative housing initiatives.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_878">I rise to vote confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage because this is a Minister who is making a real impact in Government and has delivered an exceptionally radical plan in the Housing for All strategy. This is the most radical plan in the history of this State in terms of delivering housing. It has delivered 28,000 new homes this year, which is its first year of operation. This is the largest number of new homes built since 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> This motion is no more than a political stunt but it has been very valuable because no more than the Opposition motion of no confidence in the Government a few short months ago, this motion has shown up the vacuousness of the Opposition and its sheer lack of policy. Of course, Sinn Féin has been trumped here by People Before Profit, its future partner in a left-wing Government, because People Before Profit initially moved this motion. In her contribution, Deputy McDonald outlined how what we needed was not a motion of no confidence but an immediate general election, presumably so that she can go into government with People Before Profit and left-wing friends such as Deputies Bríd Smith, Pringle, Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy to deliver and solve the housing problem for us. I presume Sinn Féin will not take any of the Rural Independents with them. It never mentions them at all. A coalition of the left is what it wants. We know what that would do to the great economy we have that enables us to invest in housing, but somehow Deputy McDonald thinks that is what is going to deliver and solve the housing crisis. We have another thing coming.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> I listened very carefully to Deputy Ó Broin, who is supposedly the housing guru not just for Sinn Féin but for this left-wing Government. In his contribution, he said our housing targets are not big enough, the plan is failing and it will not meet its targets. He went on to make three key points, which are that we need real action on vacancy ignoring what the Government is doing on Croí Cónaithe. The second point he made was that we need action on land use again ignoring the zoned land tax we introduced, the increased land value sharing legislation that came before Cabinet yesterday, the vacant property tax we introduced or indeed the new planning reform Bill that came before the Cabinet today. The latter is the biggest reform of housing policy, planning and development in the history of State brought forward by the Minister with our pioneering Attorney General Paul Gallagher, whose final week is this week. The third point he made was that we need real investment in social housing ignoring the fact that this year, the Government will deliver 9,000 social housing units, the largest ever amount in the State. Remember this is the man who wrote two books. I have not read any of them but listening to him today, you would not think he wrote them either. He finished off his great contribution by saying "shame on you" and then he walked out. That was representative of all we got from the rest of the Opposition tonight. All it did was define the problems we are working to solve. The Opposition offered no solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> In her contribution, Deputy McDonald pointed to the importance of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Fine Gael Minister for Finance. Sinn Féin has held the posts of minister for housing and minister for finance in Northern Ireland up until the government there fell a month ago. What did that deliver? Last year in Northern Ireland with a Sinn Féin housing minister and a Sinn Féin finance minister, which are very important according to Deputy McDonald, the average price of the average home rose by £18,000. This is a 12% increase with a Sinn Féin housing minister and a Sinn Féin finance minister. If you are looking to Sinn Féin to deliver, its track record would not speak very well in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The key priority for me has been mica and the Minister has been working very hard to deliver on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">We are making a real impact. Legislation has been introduced and we will have all homes in Donegal fixed. Again, if you look at Sinn Féin in that regard, the Minister asked it for advice in advance of that legislation but got none. Sinn Féin promised it would introduce its own legislation. It still has not published it six months after we introduced the legislation so, again, if we were looking to Sinn Féin in that regard, there would be very little delivery.</p>

          <p eId="para_885">We have disagreed on a lot but I think we can all agree that for many, house prices are unaffordable, rents are too high and an unacceptable number of people are in temporary accommodation. However, I rise to my feet to support the Minister because I believe he is leading the charge to address the housing crisis. As Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I have had the opportunity to see him and his team at work over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> In February 2020, when many new Members of this House left behind our role as councillors, those in all parties and none were frustrated by a decade of under-supply. We could see the problem getting worse before it might get better. Some in the House put their party first ahead of the emergency and resigned themselves to the comfort of Opposition but there were many of us who were hungry to see change and to do things differently. There has been change - real change - and let me tell you how.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> Previously, as councillors, we had two limited choices. We could build a low number of homes with low income limits, low budgets and a low number of staff or we could give that public land away to developers with no certainty regarding delivery or supply. They were unacceptable choices. With a new Minister and Government, all that has changed and we have a radically different housing plan that leads with public supply. Councillors the length and breadth of the country on public sites have greater budgets and more staff and can build more homes that are available to more people. Those councillors can build below-cost affordable purchase and below-cost secure and affordable rental such as we see in many European cities. They can partner with approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency secure in the knowledge that there are multi-annual budgets. They can build 100% public housing on public land where that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">They can buy more land for future development, tackle vacancy and dereliction, identify unutilised zoned land and tax it. Even on the sites they do not own, they can protect new homes for owner-occupiers and impose a new stricter obligation for social and affordable housing. While this and other supply measures come on stream, we have put in place protections and supports, including eviction bans, rent caps, deposit caps, rent credits, and we have continued the help to buy scheme and introduced the first home scheme. In the face of these solutions, when presented with the opportunity to solve the housing emergency, some in this House put their party first and voted against these measures. They voted against the Land Development Agency Bill, the Affordable Housing Bill and the budgets that funded them. We have empowered councils to help solve the housing crisis. We have established and capitalised a national Land Development Agency, a housing body that will deliver homes that will rival anything in the history of this State. For those listening outside this House, who do not have a home, I know all this seems like white noise. I want those people to know that change is happening. It is happening on the 25 public housing sites in my constituency alone. Planning is turning into building sites. Soon, those building sites will turn into homes for the people. We are not motivated by any investor or their dividends; we are motivated only by the people and their housing needs. I promise that this Government and the Minister have the ambition to solve this crisis. We have the money and the models, and we are building momentum.</p>

          <p eId="para_889">Access to a home is the issue of our time, and many are being restricted in getting a roof over their heads. A global depression, Brexit, a pandemic, unprecedented population growth and Putin's war have brought us here. Hearts and minds might be bought by sophistry, but Housing for All contains measured solutions and funding to meet our crisis. Through the stewardship of the Minister, I am proud to say that the Green Party has delivered legislation for 100% public housing on public land. Green Party cost-rental policy has firmly been actioned. The LDA alone has a remit to deliver 30,000 affordable high-quality cost-rental properties with succession rights. Our towns and villages are unique cultural settlements, where 30% of our population live. Under this Government, the Green Party has actioned its town centre first plans, with grants of up to €75,000 per unit available to tackle vacancy and dereliction, ensuring not only good-quality housing, but also job opportunities, safe and accessible public spaces, good transport links, climate resilience and the making of ten-minute towns. During its time in government, we have seen further Green Party policies actioned, including the abolition of co-living and the end of undemocratic strategic housing development systems. Working groups have been put in place to deliver redress for owners of defective dwellings. Further to the work of Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, in the 32nd Dáil, I have tabled a Defective Dwellings Bill, which would secure a legal redress process for homeowners. A referendum on a right to housing was a key commitment secured in the programme for Government by the Green Party, and wording is being drafted currently. A right to a home should be in our Constitution, as is the right to an education. Over the past two years, I have participated in cross-party debates in Trinity College and UCD in which the Opposition spoke in favour of the nationalisation of all homes in Ireland and the prohibition of the purchasing of council houses by tenants. My parents were afforded this opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_892">On Housing for All, let us talk about Limerick. The LDA was set up in 2018. How many houses were built in Limerick since then? I cannot hear the Minister for Finance. None, is it? That is right; no houses were built in Limerick. Very good. After investing €1.2 billion in the LDA, not one house was built in Limerick, but the members of the Government, including the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and Deputy McAuliffe, who have spoken are from Dublin. That is the problem, when we are talking about rural versus urban. We have been waiting for 37 years for a sewerage system in Askeaton, where the sewage is going into the River Shannon. The Minister's Government has promised to fix it but there has been no delivery. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael made promises in respect of Glin, but there was no delivery. There was no delivery on housing or a sewerage system for Oola. I am not talking about what is happening today, or during the Minister's tenure as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage; I am talking about the last 20 to 30 years. There has been no delivery. In Hospital, a system had to be put in place in the town until the system was upgraded, but no extra capacity was provided, which means no extra houses for the people in County Limerick. It is supposed to be Housing for All, but all I am hearing about is Dublin. What about Limerick? There are Deputies and Ministers here from Limerick, yet there is no delivery for Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">I have no personal gripe with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but we have serious problems in Kerry. I have highlighted them several times already. There are 171 voids in County Kerry. That is not acceptable. The homeless centre that operated for years in Killarney has closed down because the Government has offered people €800 tax-free per month to house Ukrainians and refugees. That is €1,600 with tax. There are homeless people in Kerry. Did the Minister ever consider putting them in hotels? The Government has no problem with putting the members of other communities in hotels. There is no affordable home programme in Kerry. The Minister should not be shaking his head. There is no affordable home programme for Kerry, which other counties have for the next five years. The vacant property tax the Government tells us will compel people to sell their land is affecting farmers who cannot sell it. The Government is closing down airbnbs. It will not let people do what they democratically have a right to do - to rent their house to whoever they want.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">Nobody in this House can genuinely question the Minister's work ethic or his commitment, but I have problems with the policies, such as the attack on short-term lets and properties rented on airbnb. It is argued that the Government's policies will bring 12,000 homes back into the long-term rental sector. That will not happen. The Government is not providing enough money on the ground to do up vacant properties. We need €2.7 million in Kerry. The Taoiseach told me last week that money was not a problem. If it is not, I ask that the €2.7 million is provided and we will do up the vacant local authority houses that we have. There is no acquisition programme for local authorities to buy up houses in County Kerry. I compliment the Minister on the Croí Cónaithe fund scheme. It will be good and I hope it will work. The repair and lease scheme was bogged down with bureaucracy and that is why it failed. On the current land tax policy that is in place, no allowance is made for farmers who are actively farming land. We cannot put people out of the business that they are in. In Kenmare, there is no sewerage scheme and no development.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> Having said all of that, in the seconds remaining, I want to comment on the Members who are proposing an attack here today and saying they have the solution to the housing crisis. They would not know one end of a shovel from the other. They could not build one block on top of another. If we were relying on them, they would not be able to house a hen.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">The Minister must think my decision to support him or not is a foregone conclusion, as he decided that I would not be one of the Independents to ring for support in the last few days. He should remember the saying of an old wise man in west Cork that what is not worth asking for is not worth getting. Votes of confidence or no confidence are very serious matters, as far as I am concerned. My record in the Dáil since 2016 shows that supported the former Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Calleary, and Deputy Cowen, who were all wrongly accused. In 2016 I called for a vote of no confidence in the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, because the country was in a deep health crisis. I did not support the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in the Zappone affair because of the lack of transparency. In my assessment of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's time as Minister, I agree that he inherited a complete mess and it is going to take time to clean that up. However, the dozens who come to my office and clinics weekly in Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bandon, Bantry and the surrounds do not have time. They are begging me for a home or not to let them be evicted. They are crying and afraid that they will not be able build a home. I know of others who spent €10,000 on planning for a west Cork island family farm and were still refused permission. It leaves the housing crisis as bad now as at any time in the past. I find it easy to make a decision on the vote on that basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_897">The Minister must have also lost my telephone number, but that is okay. There are 3,500 people waiting on the housing list in County Tipperary. We have many homeless. We have agencies and people. We have direct build, modular build housing and everything else now for people fleeing the Ukraine war. I do not oppose that, but we cannot do it for our own people.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Someone said earlier that the Minister introduced 22 Acts. It is a pity he is not in the Gaiety Theatre or the Abbey Theatre. He is in the Houses of Parliament, however. He comes from the same school as Raphael P. Burke, G.V. Wright and company and, indeed, he is well-trained in blunder and bluff. I heard the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, speak about how people better look after agriculture and fishing but instead he is selling us out on that. The Tánaiste and Taoiseach did not even stay here for the debate to support the Minister. Many more of the others would not be here either if they were not waiting for the Saturday sitting. Sunday might be a different story, however. They will be feeling sore and scratching their heads wanting to know what happened. It is time for the Minister to go and let someone who has a vision and way of doing something for someone take over.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">This evening, each one of us is being asked to vote confidence in the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. As an Independent Deputy, I try to look at the evidence of how he has performed to date as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am not interested in the politics or optics or in a call for a general election. That will not build a single house. My only concern is whether the Minister is doing his job. Are we building enough homes for our people? In less than two minutes, I will try to look at context, outcomes and future plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> Any fair assessment of the Minister's two-and-a-half-year tenure would take into consideration the slowdown in construction due to Covid-19, the escalation in building costs, supply chain challenges and Putin's aggression. Nonetheless, the bottom is that a Minister's job is to deliver regardless.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> I looked at some of the figures and outcomes and saw that, for example, the number of planning permissions granted in the 12 months to the end of June 2022 has doubled compared with 2019. Of course, completions are what matter. In the 12 months to the end of September this year, 30% more homes have been built compared with 2019. The Croí Cónaithe and town centre first schemes have real potential for rural areas and the regions. Therefore, there is progress but there is a "but".</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, nailed it when she said that we are building homes but we need to build them faster. That is what I want to see. I want to see real energy and real determination from this Government across all levels of government, from national right down to local, to deliver homes for our people. I want to see a Minister in charge who rapidly and with singular focus implements the 17 pieces of legislation he has brought forward because that is what matters. He has the money and much of the legislation in place. He has a lot of irons in the fire but any good blacksmith is judged by the finished product. We have yet to see that.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">The Minister is not responsible for the crisis in housing. The crisis is a result of an approach taken as far back as the 1980s when the State adopted a policy of not building public housing and relying solely on the private sector. The problem is based on the fact that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party bear responsibility for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> What the Minister is responsible for is spoofing and he is very good at it. He is very good at pretending he has a solution and that he is making progress. The facts speak otherwise. Just 647 new houses were built by local authorities in the first six months of this year, with 11 local authorities building none. Of the 4,100 promised affordable and cost rental homes for this year, only 325 affordable and 234 cost rental homes were actually delivered in the same six-month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Homelessness has reached record numbers of more than 11,300 men, women and children. It is a terrible indictment of this Government and this has been developing over the past ten years. Rents are rising at record levels. A record number of notices to quit and evictions have been issued. According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the most accurate estimate for households with a housing need may be close to 122,000. That takes in housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. The Minister should go and take with him the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach-in-waiting and the rest of the Government. We need not just a change of Minister but a change of Government and policy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_906">Soaring rents, outrageous house prices, crumbling County Donegal homes, large-scale housing defects countrywide, a severe shortage of housing supply, 166,000 vacant properties and homeless figures reaching all-time highs for four consecutive months. The Minister, Deputy O’Brien, is not a Minister for housing. He is a Minister for landlords, developers, vulture funds and homelessness. This Minister has, through his inaction, pitted the most vulnerable in our society against each other. He has driven and enforced an us versus them narrative and we are all suffering as a result. There is room for every single person in this country to be housed, and let us make it very clear that the decision not to do so is a choice by the Minister and the Government. This and previous governments have continually made housing a product of the market. That is the problem. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> There are many reasons I will not be voting confidence in the Minister. One on which I will focus, however, and some of the Minister's colleagues mentioned it, is the massive amount of legislation he has brought forward in the House over his term. That is true, but how much of it came through in July and December when it can be guaranteed there will not be any scrutiny or anyone looking at it? The mica legislation was rushed through the House in July with no debate or scrutiny and no examination of amendments. It was rushed through and then nothing happened. There has been complete inaction since. The mica families and people had to stand and occupy council offices to force action by the Government to ensure they could actually get accommodation and get that done.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> This week, a couple of planning Acts were put through in the jaws of Christmas when there will be no scrutiny and which will fundamentally change how the planning system will work in this country to the benefit of those same landlords, developers and vulture finds.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_909">I stand in support of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Government's motion of confidence in response to the cynical exercise of a motion put down to deflect from the work of the Minister and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Fianna Fáil sought the portfolio of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at a difficult and challenging time. We sought it, when many others ran away from forming a Government, in order that we could deliver housing for the people of this country. Housing for All is just over one year old now and it is delivering. For the first time in ten years, we can see houses being built throughout the country in every county, including my own county of Wexford. The plan is fully backed financially. It is exceeding this year's target of more than 24,600 public, private and affordable homes. Yes, there is much more work to be done, but it is on the back of more than ten years of underinvestment in housing. We will deliver, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> We are now seeing deep change. We are seeing that this plan is taking hold and that a detailed and comprehensive strategy can make a difference. Those in opposition have offered no plan. They have offered no alternative strategy, only grandstanding and a disingenuous attempt to claim a monopoly on empathy.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The Minister visited my county of Wexford only two weeks ago. We heard from Sinn Féin councillors for more than two years demanding that he go into the local authority chamber and answer questions. The first problem was that for a year and a half of that, Sinn Féin councillors forgot to invite the Minister because they were so busy running to the local radio station and newspapers. When he agreed to visit the chamber and answer all the questions, Sinn Féin councillors complained that he was going to visit on a day they could not take the day off work. Therefore, the Minister agreed to meet them in the evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">They then complained that he was going to spend only one hour and would not be able to answer all the questions in that time. He said he would not leave that chamber until every question was answered. The Sinn Féin councillors left after about 15 minutes because they had no questions once faced with detailed answers. A local newspaper noted that after months of fury from Sinn Féin councillors, the “councillors fail to land a glove... as forecasted fury fails to materialise”. The local journalist stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_914">It would also be fair to say that the same levels of anger and frustration usually directed towards Minister O’Brien in his absence were not present while he was positioned at the top table in the council chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">A star chamber it was not. As one councillor described it, they were “Mighty Mouse in the media, Mickey Mouse in the chamber.”</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> The original motion put by People Before Profit clearly seeks to put politics before people and I am glad to support the Government’s countermotion. Instead of banging the drum of self-promotion, we need solutions and the Minister is bringing those.</p>

People watching the debate have witnessed the contrast between those who want to solve the housing situation and those who want to manipulate it. People will make up their minds on that at the appropriate time. I am glad the debate is coming to an end because we might have no more Sinn Féin Deputies in the House if it continues any longer.

          <p eId="para_920">It is an important issue. I and my Government colleagues are acutely aware of the challenge the country has in tackling and solving the housing crisis. All of us in this House, whether Government or Opposition and whether some like it or not, have a responsibility to help resolve it, not to capitalise on it, manipulate it, sow division, block, delay or use any tactic to avoid supporting legislation that will fast-track delivery of the social homes that all of us in Government want. Many in Opposition say they want them but when it comes down to it and they are asked to press the button, press “Tá” and support it, they do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> The proposers of the motion which would have been taken tomorrow had Government not put down a motion of confidence, and the reason we are debating this, are our colleagues in the Opposition from People Before Profit. Members from that party regularly state we should build public housing on public land. The Government agrees with that and is doing that. When the Government introduced legislation to do it and set up a Land Development Agency on a legislative footing, what did Members from that party do? They voted against it. They were not the only ones. Sinn Féin voted against it. Deputy Cian O’Callaghan and his friends in the Social Democrats voted against it. I assume a number of colleagues opposite also voted against it. That agency delivered its first homes this year on State land, has broken ground on the biggest social and affordable housing site this country has seen in decades, in Shanganagh Castle, which Deputy Boyd Barrett had difficulties with as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_925">There is a very serious thing this Government is engaging in, namely, providing housing for all. That is why all three parties of the Government have put together a comprehensive plan that is detailed and clear for anyone who wants to read it. It sets out the actions across Government that need to be taken to improve the situation for our citizens. No one on the Opposition benches has put forward a comparable alternative. Any fair assessment will show that.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Not only have we put together a plan but we have backed it with finance and are delivering it. What did we do this year on social housing? This Government believes in social housing, even though some in the Opposition, the main Opposition party in particular, will try to paint a them-and-us attitude and suggest that we do not get it, understand it or meet people. I represent the people of Dublin Fingal and thank the hundreds of them and across the country who were in touch with me in the past week giving support and acknowledging what some Members do not want to acknowledge, namely, that this is a complex situation and not easy to resolve. We will resolve it but some want to paint this in simplistic terms, suggesting they have a solution and can sort it immediately. They cannot.</p>

          <p eId="para_928">The public knows that too. Let us show some respect to voters. That respect should extend to the fact that when Members bring forward alternatives, they should stack up and be implementable. If you support social housing across this country, do not object to it. Do not let your councillors object time after time or find any reason to object. Do not vote against legislation that will fast-track the delivery of social and affordable housing. Do not vote against legislation that means we can build on State-owned land and deliver 100% affordable and social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> The Social Democrats say they want cost rental. The Government delivered that within 12 months where it had not existed, but the Social Democrats voted against the Affordable Housing Act that sets up cost rental via a national scheme across the board. When I meet, as I do from time to time, Social Democrat councillors around the country going to the opening of new housing estates, I will welcome them.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> We have to ensure we are delivering the supply we need across the board. Thankfully, we are doing it this year. Is it enough? Of course it is not. Do we want to build up capacity to build more? Of course we do. That is the purpose of this plan. You do not go from 20,000 homes in one year to 40,000 the next. It is not doable but we have shown a way to get there by putting home ownership back at the centre of housing solutions. Our young women and young men working and renting who want to own their homes can now do that. There have been 16,000 first-time buyers in this past year. The first home scheme is the State stepping in to take the equity between the finance someone has and what they need. We have done it. It is in place and more and more people are getting out of that rental trap and accessing the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> What do People Before Profit and Sinn Féin do? Against, against, against. It is a political judgment being made by many in the Opposition to slow progress so there is not progress in two years’ time. Colleagues have a responsibility to ensure our citizens have homes and the number one priority for the Government is to tackle the homelessness crisis. We will do everything and I as Minister will work every hour that is sent to make sure we turn around that situation. Fundamentally, it is about supplying new homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> I ask Deputies Boyd Barrett, Paul Murphy and others to talk to their councillors around the country about new homes. A letter arrived in Carlow County Council on 18 November from one of their councillors objecting to 42 senior citizens’ houses in Carlow. Why? What can be wrong with that? I ask Sinn Féin what is wrong with vacancy grants? What is wrong with giving people the support they need to tackle vacancy through Croí Conaithe grants? We have a suite of measures in our plan. We are focused on delivering it and will continue to do so. I thank colleagues for their support and their contributions.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Michael McGrath)<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1087">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> I am pleased to introduce the Bill to the House. The annual Appropriation Bill is critical financial legislation that must be enacted before the end of the year. It has two primary purposes, the first of which is that it provides legal authorisation for all the expenditure that has occurred in 2022 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil over the course of this year. These allocations, known as the sums to be appropriated for supply services, are set out in section 1 and Schedule 1 to the Bill. These relate to the Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates agreed by the Dáil this year. In aggregate, these Estimates amount to €75.1 billion. The comparable sum in the Appropriation Act 2021 was €73.1 billion. The sum to be appropriated this year, therefore, represents an increase of €2 billion, or just under 3%, on last year's net voted expenditure. In gross terms and taking into account expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, the total gross voted expenditure made available this year was €90.7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> This expenditure has allowed continued investment in our economy and public services to support a strong, fair and equal society into the future. The funding allocations made in 2022 supported the delivery of important priorities in areas including housing, health, social protection, childcare, education and climate action. It has provided for increases in social assistance payments; reforms in the health sector including for Sláintecare; more teaching, special needs assistant, SNA, and special education teaching posts; and additional gardaí and Garda civil staff. It also facilitated enhanced capital funding under the national development plan, with a focus on housing, climate action and health. The sums outlined in the Bill also reflect the significant resources made available during 2022 through Supplementary Estimates. These provided additional funding to Votes for a range of developments over the year, including cost-of-living supports introduced during 2022, our provision of humanitarian supports in response to the war in Ukraine and the extension of the Building Momentum public sector pay agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> Rising prices this year have placed a financial strain on many households, individuals and businesses. To provide support towards reducing the burden of inflation, the Government introduced a number of measures over 2022, the costs of which are reflected in the sums in the Bill. In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills, the winter cost-of-living package provided €2.2 billion in supports for households, with further supports introduced for businesses and key public services. Together with the measures announced earlier this year and in budget 2022, expenditure measures introduced during this year to mitigate the impacts of increasing costs on households and businesses have a value of more than €5 billion. For example, this funding allowed for electricity credits with a value of €200 each to just over 2 million households, a 20% reduction in public transport fares, which benefited more than 800,000 daily users, additional fuel allowance payments and a double week of weekly social welfare payments in October. It also provided funding for the temporary business energy support scheme to support businesses with increases in their electricity or natural gas energy costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> The second key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into next year, in the period before the Dáil votes on the 2023 Estimates. As set out in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, the authority for spending in 2023, prior to the agreement of the 2023 Estimates by the Dáil, is based on the amounts included in the 2022 Appropriation Bill. It is for this reason that it is so important this Bill is enacted before the end of 2022. If it were not enacted, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2023 from the start of January until approval of the 2023 Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> In recognition of the challenges faced by Departments in planning for major capital projects, the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in 2004 allow for the carryover of unspent voted capital expenditure from the current year into the next year. This is subject to a maximum of 10% of the voted capital expenditure in the current year and provides a degree of flexibility in capital expenditure planning. The Appropriation Act 2022 sets out the capital amounts which are to be carried over to 2022 on a Vote basis. In aggregate, capital carryover from 2022 to 2023 amounts to almost €690 million, which is approximately 6% of the overall Exchequer capital programme for 2022 of €11.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> This carryover into 2023 will bring the overall amount available to Departments for gross voted capital spending next year to more than €12.5 billion. This will continue the increased capital investment of recent years under our national development plan, NDP. It is the largest and greenest plan of its kind in the history of the State committing €165 billion in public capital investment over the period to 2030. It seeks to ensure that a greater level of development and investment is focused on our villages, towns and cities, to enable growth in line with the national planning framework. Delivering the NDP is a huge undertaking. This year has been pivotal in consolidating the progress already made and, most importantly, delivering the infrastructure to support our future climate, social and economic requirements. We must continually adapt to ensure that projects are completed on time. Reforms are ongoing to strengthen delivery, to maximise value for money and to ensure to the greatest extent possible that projects are delivered on time and on budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> I recognise that the construction industry has faced many challenges as a consequence of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. This has led to greater supply chain issues and increased prices across a range of construction materials such as structural steel, copper and insulating materials. In order to safeguard the delivery of key NDP projects, I have introduced measures to address inflation for new contracts and tenders and introduced a form of price variation or burden sharing to ensure that taking on public works contracts remains a viable proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> Schedule 2 of the Bill sets out the proposed capital carryover amounts. The Revised Estimates Volume for 2023, to be published this week will include a table listing the amounts to be deferred by sub-head for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> As in previous years, the Appropriation Bill provides for a repayable advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account in order to meet certain 2023 Exchequer liabilities due for payment over the first week of January. The need for this provision arises as the banking system will be closed on Monday, 2 January. This means that funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year in order to meet those liabilities on a timely basis. There is a related need to pre-fund certain payments under the Social Welfare Acts due between the 1 and 7 of January 2023 that are made on an agency basis by An Post. The advances provision in the Bill ensures payments can be transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the network of post offices throughout the country. Section 3 of the Bill provides for up to €355 million to be advanced from the Central Fund to meet these requirements. This advance would be then repaid to the Central Fund in January 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> The annual Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping undertaken by the Dáil each year. The passage of this Bill will authorise in law all the expenditure that has taken place in 2022, on the basis of the Estimates voted by the Dáil over the course of this year. Importantly, it will also provide authority for voted expenditure to continue in the period between the beginning of January 2023 and when the Dáil approves the 2023 Estimates. This will ensure continued funding for the operation of our essential public services such as our health service, payment of social protection schemes and the running of our schools. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MaireadFarrell" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Deputy Mairéad Farrell<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1098">Before I begin on the Appropriation Bill, I note that this might be the Minister's last occasion to address the Dáil as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I thank him for being very constructive throughout his term and I wish him all the best for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> The purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to give statutory authority for the amounts voted by the Dáil during the year. The appropriation of sums voted for supply services this year is just over €75 billion. The Bill also provides for the definitive capital carryover facility from 2022 to 2023. Generally, money that is not spent goes back to the Exchequer, but due to changes in the Finance Act 2004 we have a facility to carry over unspent capital into the next year. This year we will be carrying over about €687 million. Capital expenditure has been rising in recent years as set out in the national development plan. This is to try to address our infrastructural crisis. The IMF, OECD and EU have all pointed out the weakness of our public infrastructure <i>vis-à-vis </i>our EU peers. They have pointed out that it is harming Ireland's competitiveness. It is also creating terrible socioeconomic problems, particularly in housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> Of course, none of this will be new to the Minister. Earlier we debated a confidence motion arising from in no-confidence motion in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as a result of his failure to get to grips with the crisis. In many ways the Appropriation Bill or rather the capital carryover facility highlights the weaknesses of the Government's approach. It has failed to address the capacity constraints facing the construction sector. As capital expenditure has risen, so too has the capital carried over each year. In 2020, €710 million was carried over. In 2021 this rose to €820 million. I recognise that the figure is lower this year but I think other factors like the use of the inflation co-operation framework have played a role here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> I also want to be constructive. The Minister is departing for the Department of Finance and some of what I mention might have more relevance for his successor but some are measures he could enact in his next role. There has not been enough effort to redirect the construction workforce towards residential construction. As has been pointed out this evening, in 2000 our construction sector workforce was 138,000 strong and in that year just under 50,000 new homes were delivered. Now in 2022 the size of the construction workforce is now 168,000. That is 30,000 more workers and yet we might not even turn out 25,000 new homes this year. Something has clearly gone wrong. While I would normally recognise that changes to the tax system are not in his remit, he is soon, of course, to become Minister for Finance and will have the power to use the tax system to redirect the workforce. From the perspective of the public finances, failing to do so is totally self-defeating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> Let me give a concrete example. In 2011 total public expenditure on the various housing supports like housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, homeless supports, the capital loans and subsidy scheme etc. was €627 million. In 2020, nine years later, the latest year for which I could get data, that had increased to €3.6 billion, a 480% increase which is hardly a prudent use of scarce resources. If the workforce had been directed towards building more homes the Government would not need to be spending so much on these subsidies. I know the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform first began examining how to promote modern methods of construction for which it deserves credit. I note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also taken up that mantle, presumably more in terms of wider industrial strategy. The Tánaiste's new White Paper outlines a desire to drastically increase the productivity of indigenous firms such as those engaged in construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Those are obviously laudable aims but are they credible?</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> The White Paper is remarkably scant on details of how to do many of the things that it is proposing. It talks about using the public procurement process to support innovative SMEs but this State has no history of using public procurement for strategic purposes. The focus here for the contract award criterion has traditionally been lowest price and I am not aware of any changes being outlined for new procurement legislation that is in the pipeline. </p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me as I would obviously welcome such a thing, were it forthcoming but I have seen very little progress in this regard. I have been engaging with multiple local authorities across the State to assess how many modern methods are being used and am aware that Dublin City Council has made some good efforts but it is the exception rather than the rule. Without some new plan for the public procurement system, whereby we can create the demand for these kinds of services, then this will remain an aspiration rather than a real plan for transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> Only recently the Construction Industry Federation pointed out that less than a third of SMEs win public work contracts. One can think of the innovative SMEs doing modern methods of construction using things like off-site manufacturing, modular and prefabricate build, using the likes of building information modelling, and things like precast concrete; and they are really struggling to win public contracts. There are only 100 of these kinds of SMEs in the State but only a quarter deliver full housing solutions. That is because we have not used the State as the largest spender within the economy to create that kind of a demand. Many of those SMEs engaged in modern methods have now turned instead towards building data centres, which seems completely on its head.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> Unless the Minister or his successor uses the public procurement system to really promote modern methods of construction, it will take years before it reaches widespread adoption and we will continue to struggle with capacity issues. If we use the procurement system to create the demand; contractors will then seek to supply that demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108"> I would like to give a concrete example. Building information modelling is mandatory in all public works contracts in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and many more countries. The use of building information modelling is therefore widespread in these countries. It is not mandatory in public works contracts here, even for large projects, for example, of over €100 million and that is something that could be done immediately with ease. This would speed up the pre-construction phase of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> Data I received recently on the average amount of time local authorities spent on the pre-construction phase of development were astounding. Cork City Council spent an average of 155 weeks in the pre-construction phase of development and that is not far off three years which, of course, is absolutely bonkers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> The Minister could bring in an amendment tomorrow to make building information modelling mandatory above a certain level and I thought of doing so myself but, as we had this discussion in the past week, I have had difficulties in having my Bills progressed due to the money message provision. </p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> We are also failing on the apprenticeships front. While I recognise that the Minister’s Department is not responsible for that, his Department has taken the lead in promoting modern methods of construction. I recently submitted a parliamentary question to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science which was on the back of a report which it had carried out itself on the kind of new apprenticeship places we need to develop. Thus far there are no apprenticeship places in modern methods of construction. There are no college or university places offering training in this regard. Often, it seems to me, that when it comes to this Government, the left hand does not seem to know what the right hand is doing. </p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> How can we really improve construction sector capacity through modern methods of construction when the education and training places simply do not exist? I know that there has been much detail in my contribution there but, in fairness, a great deal of work needs to be done. If all of these measures were enacted it would not be revolutionary but rather, moderately evolutionary. I still believe that more radical action is again required. I will be bringing forward in the new year a very substantial piece of policy work that I have been working on over the past eight months. President Higgins recently stated that the key to solving the housing crisis was for the State to build public homes on public land, and he is dead right on that. The Government seems to have tried every conceivable market-based solution and in the new year I will be bringing forward my own proposal, including much of what I have outlined there this evening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_408">
          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1113">I share in the earlier remarks from Deputy Mairéad Farrell in wishing the Minister well over the next period of time without pre-empting anything. We all know that it is intended that he will move across the corridor next weekend. I wish him well and I am sure he will miss these occasions once a year when he is moving the Appropriation Bill, as the country watches in. I am equally sure that there is nobody watching the World Cup match this evening and they are all watching in attentively on this debate on the Appropriation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> It was not long ago when the Appropriation Bill simply went through on the nod, so at least we are having some form of debate and parliamentary interrogation of this Bill, which is probably much more than can be said for the kinds of Supplementary Estimates that were presented to us this year. We all know that there is a requirement to spend much more than the Government, or anybody on the Opposition benches would have anticipated, when budget 2022 was formulated in October 2021. Nobody could have anticipated the Ukraine crisis and the impact that that would have on energy costs and on the cost of living, more generally; or the impact that the cost of living would have, especially for people who depend on the State for their income. The Labour Party supported initiatives to provide for forms of once-off expenditure to help people who are in difficult circumstances at the moment. </p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> We have also been critical of the fact that those once-off measures, once they are gone, they are gone. The reality is that the cost-of-living crisis is not going away. Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, put on the record earlier on that it is likely that we will have high energy costs to deal with over the next two years at least. In other words, energy costs will not come down and even when they do, they will not come down as quickly as they had gone up. I have no doubt that we will be back here in the spring, and the Minister will be here in his new job presenting new proposals and measures of expenditure to assist families and businesses to get through what clearly will be more challenging times next year and the year after.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> I believe we have had €4.4 billion of Supplementary Estimates presented to us this year. That is a big chunk of change in anybody’s language and I will take the Minister back to some remarks I made last year, and the year before, when we were dealing with the Appropriation Bill around the question of parliamentary oversight of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> Constitutionally, it is the job of the Dáil to approve Government expenditure but the reality is that expenditure has always been a creature of Government, being rubber-stamped, in effect, by the Dáil. This was one of the weaknesses that the OECD and others identified in their post-crash analysis of how we do public policy in this country. I will take the Minister back to a report in 2018 by the OECD where it ranked Ireland a shocking 61st out of 70 countries when it came to parliamentary engagement in the budgetary process. The OECD felt that there was almost no revision whatsoever of budget proposals by the Legislature and stated that this would be difficult to view as beneficial for fiscal democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> The most important thing we do in this Chamber on an annual basis is the allocation of moneys to Departments in the public interest and the reality is that there is little scrutiny of that. It is improving in the sense that we now have the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, both of which do a very good job, but there is no doubt that we could improve that pillar of democracy. In truth, very few improvements have been made by this Government in respect of the interrogation of those figures or of a real role for this Parliament in formulating budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> One of the things we need to look at very closely is the way in which moneys will be allocated under the temporary business energy support scheme. While supporting the thrust of the scheme, I have been a critic, for example, of the way in which the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employer wage subsidy scheme were designed. I was front and centre in revealing the information that several hundred million euro were paid out under the wage subsidy scheme to businesses which were paying out dividends to shareholders in companies which clearly did not need it. We know that there is an emergency at the moment but some of those lessons in respect of the design of that scheme need to be applied to the design of future State support schemes, where considerable amounts of money were transferred from the State to private businesses. We all accept and understand that businesses require support this year to be able to make ends meet, keep the doors open and to keep people in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">We need to keep a watching brief on the performance of the TBESS. I mention that in the context of 2022 and the Appropriation Bill because some of the moneys allocated towards the end of this year will be used to resource that scheme, which is being backdated, to the best of my recollection, to the autumn. That is welcome. We are spending €1.2 billion of public money. Any other country across Europe we care to mention attached some form of conditions to the allocation of money from the public purse to private enterprise. We know it is needed, but we can perform better in terms of the conditions and requirements we might attach to schemes like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121"> This year there has been a significant capital underspend. Some capital is being carried over. Inevitably, that will be the case but the one that sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb is the amount of moneys that remain unspent in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I welcome one initiative from the Minister. I did not have the opportunity to mention this earlier in my speech on the confidence motion. I refer to a decision made by Government to relieve local authorities of expensive loans they took out, Louth County Council included, in the mid-2000s at the instruction of the then Minister and Department of the Environment to buy expensive land on which they planned to build public housing. Those loans have been a noose around the necks of local authorities. This is public land owned by local authorities on which public housing could be built. I am pleased the Minister is using some of the resources that remain available in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's budget this year to relieve local authorities like Louth County Council of, for example, a €56 million debt on two sites in the Drogheda area that could accommodate up to 300 units. This is happening on the basis that those units would be developed on a fast-track basis in 2023-2024, something that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> Deputy Farrell mentioned that the idea that we are carrying capital over on the basis that we do so every year, or very routinely, is almost a failure of the Government to plan. We understand there are pressures in terms of labour, costs and so on, but failure to spend half a billion euro in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at the time of a housing crisis is quite perverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> I will conclude on a general point. The surplus that the country will generate on the backs of hard-working people and businesses this year is quite extraordinary. It is something that this country ought to be proud of. We should be proud of it, but it is perverse that people are waiting for public housing and are on health waiting lists. People are demanding a step change in the provision of renewable energy and building up that infrastructure, but we do not have the capacity to spend sufficient amounts of that money to try to make the improvements we ought to make to our society and economy. We are still, in an international context, spending much less than the countries we like to compare ourselves against in terms of public investment, whatever way we might describe it, whether compared to GDP or, more appropriate in an Irish context, GNI*. </p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> Due to our recent history, we have had a period of significant under-investment and we are playing catch up. We need to play catch up. We need a conversation in the House about how we properly resource our Departments and the NDP. I accept we are spending significant amounts of money on the NDP to achieve the objectives we want to achieve for this country. </p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> When the Minister becomes Minister for Finance shortly, Ireland needs to be front and centre in arguing against any attempt to impose a fiscal straitjacket in terms of the reimposition of a form of fiscal treaty rules. We need space to be able to invest in our infrastructure and economy to make sure that we address the issues around catch up, especially around renewables, critical infrastructure and housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1126">I would also like to wish the Minister all the best. I am not sure if he is going to be Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach. Only time will tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> The reality is that this Government puts aside money every year for capital projects and fails to deliver on some of them. Meanwhile, areas like Cork North-Central are screaming out for funding and investment because of under-investment over the years. I refer to the northern ring road and northern distributor road. The Minister is a Cork man. I invite him to drive to the north side of Cork city and Cork North-Central, and return to his constituency in Cork South-Central and tell me there is balanced and even development and investment by the Government. The people I represent see articulated trucks and heavy goods vehicles driving through residential areas because this Government and previous Governments have failed to deliver investment in the north side of Cork city. </p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> It is not just about roads, but also primary care centres in places like Blarney and Ballyvolane. It is also about housing. There is a difference in investment on one side of the city compared to the other. The north side has been neglected for decades. That is why I ran on a campaign to end the neglect of the north side. When the Minister becomes the Minister for Finance I hope he will deliver the money we need because there is huge under-investment. We need schools, jobs, roads and investment in the north side. There is sheer frustration from the people I represent when they see hundreds of millions of euro not spent when they are crying out for investment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1129">The Social Democrats will not oppose this annual piece of legislation as we know it is needed to give legal authorisation to spending for the rest of this year and into next year. As has been the case for the previous two years, it is difficult to draw any sort of meaningful comparison with these figures. While normal life resumed for much of the country in the course of this year, Covid, of course, has not gone away and that is reflected in the figures before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> We saw proof of that last week with the Supplementary Estimates for health. Of the more than €1.3 billion agreed, 85% was driven by Covid. What really sets this year apart from previous years is the spiralling cost of living. While I support the increased State intervention that has followed, this Government's response falls short of what struggling families and workers generally need to get through the winter and into next year. The Government billed budget 2023 as a giveaway budget, and I accept that it was the largest in years. There is no disputing that fact. However, all we have to do is look past the headline figures and spin to soon realise high income earners benefited disproportionately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> At a time when we should be investing heavily in public services - goodness knows there is no shortage of areas where we should be investing heavily, such as in housing, healthcare and disability services – the Government decided that rather than doing that, it would take a deliberate decision to erode the tax base. In doing so, it was playing to perhaps not its base but to the Fine Gael base. The weaknesses in the budget measures will soon become obvious when the temporary supports dry up and more and more people are struggling to put food on their tables, heat their homes or keep a roof over their heads. That is the reality and it is important that is stressed in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> In respect of the figures detailed in the Bill, some certainly were not commentary. Spending on health is the stand out area, representing 30% of the total supply of grants. Yet, despite this record spend, we are still lagging behind in the implementation of Sláintecare. Sláintecare set out to achieve what we should be trying to always achieve in spending, namely, that we spend to save. We have a health service which is desperately discriminatory. It is a two-tier service and, by and large, available for people who can afford to pay for private health insurance. If people cannot pay, they go on long waiting lists. There are major issues with cross-subsidisation from the public purse to the private sector. There are a whole lot of issues around that. </p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> We are an outlier in European terms regarding not having the kind of public health service the majority of people are happy to use and works properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">There are serious questions over the cost of fully implementing the Sláintecare plan, and the Minister's Department should be concerned about that. The Sláintecare Implementation Strategy &amp; Action Plan 2021-2023 pledged €3.69 billion for implementation but contained no costings at all. It turns out that the 2021 Sláintecare figure, the budget of €1.235 billion, had been just multiplied by three. That was the extent of any kind of examination of the costings. Obviously, that is no way to approach financial planning, and I am afraid it speaks to a wider issue, that is, the Government's lack of commitment to meaningful reform of the health service. There has been a lot happening and there are a lot of plans down on paper, but the pace of that reform has been desperately slow and the critical shift of activity away from the expensive acute hospital sector to the community is happening very slowly. That lower cost model of care is what we are trying to achieve, but we know that the hospital sector eats up the lion's share of the budget. That is the whole switch and refocus required under Sláintecare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> If the Government is really serious about implementing Sláintecare, the costs need to be updated. That has not happened since 2017. As the Minister will know, a huge amount has changed since then. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council estimates that the plan might cost an extra €1.5 billion by 2027. This needs urgent attention. An updated ten-year funding programme is required. I ask the Minister to ensure that that happens - and not only that. Again, if the Government regards having a properly functioning universal, single-tier public health service, it must commit to the funding annually. It should not be up to the whim of the Minister; it should be pre-committed funding in the Government's budget every year, just as public pay agreements and a number of other things are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> Another issue which falls under the Minister's brief and relates to the Department of Health is the rent payable on Miesian Plaza. The Minister will know that I have been chasing this issue for years. While I am glad to see it finally resolved, the State got a poor deal on it. The State failed to protect the public purse to the tune of about €4 million by caving in to the demands of the landlord. That should not happen. A better deal should have been struck on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> As for housing policy, it would be remiss of me not to point out the staggering €340 million being deferred to next year by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That does not include a substantial sum of money that was intended for housing but that has been diverted to other projects within that Department. It is by far the largest deferral, representing almost 50% of the total figure. That is just indefensible in the context of a housing emergency. One has to ask where this Government's sense of urgency is when it comes to the housing crisis. Does it not see the adults forced to live with their parents well into their 20s and 30s? That figure has gone up from 36% of people in their 20s and 30s who ended up living at home during those adult years to 61% of people in their 20s and 30s now still living at home. Does the Government not see the workers who cannot aspire to homeownership? Does it not see the 11,397 people, including 3,500 children, living in emergency accommodation? It is an absolutely shameful situation. The Government can keep telling us that its housing plan is working, but it is clearly not. The situation, in fact, is only getting worse because house prices are going up, rents are going up and the number of people in homelessness is going up all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> The figures do not lie; the Government cannot argue with them. It is underspending and undoubtedly underperforming when it comes to housing in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> Last week I raised the pathetic vacant homes tax with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and called on him to implement a tougher tax rate when he moves into the Department of Finance. Today I wish to raise with him another ridiculous housing policy, that is, long-term leasing. This is a prime example of policy that is appalling value for money yet championed by this Government. Public expenditure, as I said, should be guided by the principle of spending to save. The spending on long-term leases does the absolute opposite of that. It takes out leases on homes that have been built, predominantly apartments - high-rise apartments, build-to-rent apartments, which were built with lower standards, smaller apartments and so on. They are entirely inappropriately located, with 14 or 15 storeys in established residential areas and so on. The key thing about this, however, is that the State is paying the equivalent of a mortgage over a 25-year period or top-dollar rent. The local authority has responsibility for tenants, maintenance and so on, and after those 25 years of paying what amounts to a mortgage on each of those apartments, the local authority has to refurbish them and hand them back, so it does not end up with any asset after that huge outlay over a 25-year period. This is the most expensive way of providing social homes for people, and I have no idea why the Government is doing it. The city manager in Dublin was very clear about this. Through the planning changes the Government introduced, the lowering of standards and the mandatory national guidelines, it has created poor-quality housing and high-rise housing that is unsuitable for long-term living, and it is paying through the nose for it. That is not a responsible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> On Saturday, by all accounts, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will become the Minister for Finance. I wish him well personally in that regard but ask him to please consider a change in tack. He has been led by the nose to a large extent and in many respects by his Fine Gael colleagues in respect of erosion of the tax base and failure to invest significantly in public services. I ask him to cease this continuous calling for tax cuts and to invest in public services, make ours a cohesive State and change direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_1141">I think it is fair to say housing is the single biggest issue any of us as constituency Deputies need to deal with. No matter the result decided here today, the fact is that there is no confidence outside, in the wider world, among the people I deal with and, I assume, the people many of my colleagues across this Chamber deal with in the present Government being able to deliver on housing. The issue we have with housing and accommodation is having an impact across every element of society. It is having a huge impact on economic delivery, and until such time as we put the correct plans in place we will not do business. We know that we need to ensure we have the throughput of workforce and we know we have to make sure the apprenticeship model and everything else we are operating provides that pipeline. We need to make sure that the State does all it possibly can from the point of view of delivering the homes necessary. That is affordable mortgages, council houses and cost rental. Unless we do that, we will be in a forever spin and will be failing people constantly. The homeless numbers and so on have already been referred to. At the moment we are looking at an abject failure. We need a change of Government but we definitely need a change of tack from the Ministers opposite. The people out there need that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1142">I must comment on my disappointment that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has left, given that the Government earlier, on the confidence motion, spent a lot of its time claiming rather disingenuously that members of the Opposition were not here. We will see to what extent anybody really bought that, but it was part of a concerted effort to prevent the real, substantial discussion as to what is actually happening in a key area of public investment to solve the housing crisis in this country, which is blighting the lives of so many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The tabling of a confidence motion, when originally there was a no confidence motion, allowed the Government to dominate and to minimise the ability of the Opposition to put forward its case. That is part of the parliamentary game-playing that goes on in here. Then we have a debate which is dealing with substance around what is actually being spent by different Departments or what was not spent from what was supposed to be spent by Departments. This debate, helpfully for the Government, will be completely ignored by the media. There are virtually no Deputies here for the discussion on what was spent and not spent. However, when you examine the money that was spent and was not spent, you learn certain things that provide slightly more tangible evidence for the various claims and counter-claims that are being made about Government policy and particularly in the area of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> There is a startling figure on carryover of expenditure which is money that was allocated to be spent but was not spent. By far the biggest figure, which does not tell the whole story, is that for the housing Department. It is €340 million that will be carried over to next year because it was not spent. It is part of a bigger figure of €700 million. The Minister of State may be able to illuminate this but I think the maximum carryover figure can only be 10% of the original allocation, so this is not the full picture of what was not spent because you are only allowed to carry over the maximum amount. However, €340 million is a huge amount and there was also other money that was not spent on housing. I would argue that much of the money we spent on housing was wasteful expenditure that does not help to deal with the housing crisis. It is a shocking fact that the Government cannot spend €700 million in the teeth of an absolutely extraordinary housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> You can look at the figures and see this but, again, this is the material that does not really get out there. However, people, you might call them the nerds but they are very useful nerds, like Mr. Mel Reynolds the housing commentator puts figures together each year and the actual housing figures are quite telling. It explains why all this money was not spent. Mel Reynolds does not simply look at what the Government claims it will build or spend in terms of housing but at what is actually happening to the housing stock and where there is more public housing at the end of the year than there was at the beginning because that would actually tell you something.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> Here is a fact: in 2017 Dublin City Council had 24,990 local authority houses. Five years later, it had 24,722. That is minus 268 after all the money that was spent or not spent, and after all the claims that it was going to ramp up the investment in public housing, Dublin City Council has 268 fewer local authority houses than it had five years ago. It is quite extraordinary. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has done slightly better. It gained 25 local authority houses in five years. Fingal County Council has gained 780. That sounds a lot better when you are dealing with a minus figure or 35 but when you are dealing with thousands and thousands of families on a housing list, that is pretty disastrous too. South Dublin County Council has 452 additional after five years in the epicentre of the housing crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> I have mentioned here before that the figure for additional local authority houses built by Dublin City Council in the first two quarters of this year was zero; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was zero; Fingal County Council was zero; and South Dublin County Council was zero. How does the Government manage to claim that it is going to deliver 9,000 social houses and a few thousand additional affordable houses when this is the actuality of what is happening? The total number of new local authority houses and approved housing body houses is 1,632 in the first six months of this year. How does it manage to claim that it is nearly or not far off meeting its targets? It has not spent the money and these are the actual figures. It is because it delivers the social houses that the State has not built itself by lease or by HAP tenancies. That is an enormous waste of money. </p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> Take the biggest landlord in the country, IRES REIT. A recent study showed that it makes an average of 50% profit on every single tenant, on rents that are through the roof. A huge amount of that is being paid by the taxpayer in HAP, RAS and leasing payments to these landlords who are seeing absolutely extraordinary increases in their profits. You can say the same for Cairn Homes. Its profit margins jumped by 167% in the last year. It is the biggest owner of zoned building land in Dublin city. These are extraordinary profits but we end up paying for much of that because we will buy the affordable housing from them. That is why, of course, we voted against the Government’s Affordable Housing Bill because it explicitly linked the price of affordable housing to market prices. It said it would be benchmarked against market prices. There would be something of a discount but market prices that are manipulated upwards to astronomical levels by the likes of Cairn Homes where we have more than 70,000 planning permissions for apartments but only 5,000 apartments being delivered each year in the last number of years. These people drip-feed construction so that prices stay high, rents stay high and then the State, the tenant or the house buyers pay through the nose because these people are manipulating the entire situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> When it comes to the actual allocation for the State to do the cost-effective thing, which is to build its own housing on its own land and cut out the profit margins of the IRES REITs and Cairn Homes, there is a complete failure to deliver or to spend the money that was allocated to do that. The Government is the mouthpiece for these very same people and says that it is not because of all that we have a housing crisis. No, it is because someone objected somewhere to a housing development. We have tens of thousands of planning permissions that are not being commenced by these people, so what we will do is make it easier for the developers to get rezoned land or to get planning permission in order that they can get even more land assets and control even more of the market to rob even more money from tenants, house buyers and from the public purse in appropriation. It would make you sick.</p>

          <p eId="para_1150">I support this Bill but want to make a couple of points about it, especially regarding the lack of investment, including in Mayo and the rest of the west. The failure to include the western rail corridor in the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, funding scheme is a missed opportunity. EU funding of up to 20% of the overall project value could be provided to successful applicants. We keep missing the target in addressing regional imbalance. This is an opportunity to hit it. The Minister of State needs to start considering the country as a whole and the neglect of the west and rural areas. We talk about climate change, using public transport and getting cars off the road but at the same time find there is no investment. There is a lot of talk and vague announcements but we need to see delivery in the west. The western rail corridor could be a catalyst for what is needed. I do not buy that the western rail corridor cannot be included because the assembly is not up and running in the North. The recommendations of the all-island rail review must be implemented. There is absolutely nothing other than the lack of political will stopping the reopening of the western rail corridor.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1151">I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his handling of the public finances and, in particular, the flexibility he and his Department have shown in responding to what has been a very difficult time for spending on new, rapidly changing priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> While I understand and appreciate that select committees deal with the allocation of finances and resources, our total gross expenditure is €69.9 billion, with 2023 Estimates from the budget to be €74.25 billion. This House needs to scrutinise matters of financial interest. I know there is time for questions in the Dáil but we need to have scrutiny. This debate is a formality in some ways, given that the Opposition will not be challenging it. Therefore, it is a constitutional imperative. Without it, we will not be able to spend money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> We all get the ins and outs of this Bill, which ensures unspent capital will be deferred. I will raise several areas in respect of which further investment is required in my constituency, which includes County Louth and east Meath. I would like to put in my stake in respect of any moneys left over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> After the pandemic, the war in Ukraine affected numerous crises, and these significantly affected public finances in 2022. This year, additional funding was provided to support the winter cost-of-living measures and the delivery of key public services to provide supports for workers, businesses and communities impacted by the cost-of-living crisis. This funding has been allocated for a wide range of measures, primarily income and employment support schemes under the Department of Social Protection and supports for affected businesses and sectors through grants. If this legislation is not agreed upon today, we will be delaying the promises made on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> Our system of social welfare seeks to provide an effective social safety net for the more vulnerable. In addition to a core budget package, the amount allocated in the budget for 2023 was €6.9 billion, comprising €5.8 billion in expenditure and €1.1 billion in tax. This level of investment reflects our commitment to social support, which has been particularly important in the unprecedented times of 2021 and 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> On the topic of budget allocations, it is important in the appropriation of moneys that we consider the hospitality sector to safeguard jobs and protect the industry. Irish businesses are facing energy price increases on top of supply chain problems in the middle of another significant jump in the official inflation rate. There are incredible challenges right across the business and SME sectors. The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will provide €1.2 billion in low-cost lending to business and will work alongside other measures announced in the budget, such as the temporary business energy support scheme, in supporting businesses through the energy crisis. I have spoken to many businesspeople in Dundalk, Louth and east Meath over recent months and have been flabbergasted by the cost increases they are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> The maintenance of the allocation in capital funding for tourism development of €130 million will help Fáilte Ireland to continue to support the delivery of enhanced tourism amenities in line with the objectives of the new national development plan for the period 2021 to 2030. That said, there are significant challenges facing the tourism sector, and the viability of some tourism businesses is a genuine concern. New figures from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation show that, so far this year, visitor numbers are down 20%. Meanwhile, the Government’s failure to use budget 2023 to extend the 9% VAT rate - it is increasing it by 50% from 1 March next year - was described as disappointing, along with the fact that the Government has not fully recognised the importance of the tourism industry to every town and county. While budget 2023 should rightly be a cost-of-living budget, it should also have formed part of a wider roadmap towards ensuring Ireland is an attractive place to do business rather than crucifying the tourism and hospitality sectors with a VAT increase come March 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> The second point I wish to raise on core expenditure relates to investment versus return in our other core public services, specifically health and housing. On housing, I am sure there are many wish lists at the end of year for all parties concerned. Housing is consistently highlighted as a top priority and is significantly important considering the increasing number in homelessness and the increased requirement for social housing. These are paramount for the years to come. The amounts allocated to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage were €5.4 billion in 2021 and €6 billion in 2022, and the allocation is estimated to be €4.5 billion in 2023. This level of resourcing reflects our commitment to making housing a key priority of the Government. The Appropriation Bill will allow for the definitive capital carryover from 2022 to 2023 that I would like to see invested in my constituency, which includes Louth and east Meath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> Another wish on the list would be for reflection and accountability in the health system. In the budget, the Government announced an investment of €23.4 billion in Ireland’s health and social care services. However, it has come to light that, on 25 October 2022, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation recorded the highest number of patients on trolleys in the year to that date. There were 669 people, including 28 children, without a bed. Our rate of acute bed capacity is 2.8 per 1,000 of the population, whereas the OECD average is 4.3. If nothing is done about this, along with the 40,000-plus waiting time breaches, it will result in the complete opposite of what was promised in our national service plan for 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> With regard to our hospital services, on top of record emergency department waiting times and overcrowding, the decision to close Navan accident and emergency department will have a significant knock-on effect on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The hospital is currently dealing with a deficit of 16 doctors. Just last weekend, 11 ambulances were parked outside the emergency department of the hospital and could not leave because there were no beds or trolleys for their patients inside. This is not happening in Louth alone. I have a constituent, John Evans, who waited for urgent surgery in Beaumont and was sent home from the accident and emergency department twice. He is not the only constituent waiting on crucial surgery in Beaumont. What is going on? When will the waiting lists be dealt with? When will the trolley crisis be dealt with? As I have continually said, there are many rules and regulations but nothing is enforced, or there is no accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> I also wish to raise the issue of specialist care. There are significant service delays in this area in County Louth, especially regarding therapeutic intervention. It would be appreciated if any carryover from 2022 were invested in specialist care services. I am aware of 15 families with adolescent children with autism or a moderate learning disability who urgently require a psychiatric review but who have been told by the HSE this service is unavailable as there are no psychiatrists on the Louth HSE team. If more than half the population are eligible for GP cards, where are the GPs and specialists going to come from? I welcome the changes made by the Minister in the provisions for the sector but we need genuine innovation beyond what is now being contemplated. Providing quality healthcare is a key priority for the Government. Recent years have seen significant increases in resources for the day-to-day running of our health service. This will remain a priority for the Government. Given the scale of the overall allocation, effective management of health expenditure is crucial. Increased capital investment will be critical as we face new challenges in the years ahead, especially on the back of the pandemic and two enormous challenges, namely, the electricity crisis and cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> Taking into account the total gross voted capital expenditure allocation for 2023 of €11.7 billion as set out in the budget, the addition of a capital carryover of €800 million brings the total available voted capital expenditure for next year to €12.5 billion. This increased investment will play an important role in delivering much-needed public infrastructure across Ireland, especially in sectors such as social housing, higher education, primary healthcare, public transport, water infrastructure and climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> This essential technical legislation authorises in law all of the expenditure that was agreed by way of Estimates during this year. The House will be aware that the passage of the Bill is required to ensure it is possible to make payments in 2023 in respect of services that were funded from voted expenditure this year, including the jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, the non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, Garda pay, teachers' pay, all other pay and pensions funded from voted money, and payments to suppliers of goods and services, including small and medium enterprises. Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, the passage of this Bill will allow the payments required to deliver those services to continue into 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> In all four areas we need to do much better because we are putting at risk resources that will be critical to the country's well-being. We must significantly reprioritise these areas as national priorities. It is really important we do this in a way that is well thought through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> As a general point, both last year and this year the State has done what it does best, namely, support our people, invest in public services and infrastructure and ensure we can continue to look after people to the best of our ability. Contrary to some of its critics, it is capable of being agile, responsive and innovative when required and when the political will is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> The Bill is important in that it will underpin spending in 2023 and enable us to continue with that spending in the early part of next year until the Estimates come back from the committees and are passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1167">This Bill is required so that spending that happened in 2022 is sanctioned and legislated for, and so the spending in 2023 can happen. I am very concerned that there has been a huge amount of money, €673 million, not spent this year and similar last year. Can the Minister, Deputy McGrath, honestly look in the faces of the people at the moment and tell them that €673 million was not spent this year and similar last year? These are the people who are going cold, the people who are going hungry, the people who have no housing. Can the Minister honestly look at them, and all of the people who are paying extra taxes on inflated fuel costs because the Government took 50% on fuel taxes? Can the Minister honestly tell them now he has €673 million he did not spend? Yet the Government made them suffer and the Government will make them suffer this Christmas. How did the Government get it so wrong? The Government has never had as much money in its coffers as it does now. There is wasting of money by the Government and yet it still has €673 million unspent. There are men, women and children throughout this country who are going cold and hungry, yet the Government has this money that has not been spent. I just cannot believe it. It is not often I am stuck for words but, for once in my life, now I am stuck for words when it comes to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> It is bad enough the Government would bring Members up here on Saturday on the last weekend before Christmas when most charities around Ireland go out to collect money for vulnerable people. Yet the Government will spend thousands upon thousands of euro of taxpayers' money bringing Deputies and staff from across the country to Dublin to open up the Dáil on the last weekend before Christmas. It is a weekend when people and vulnerable people look for help to fundraise in our own areas. Yet the Government wants us to come here to have a big hurrah on something that could be done on a weekday. They are spending more of the taxpayers' money and laughing at the people who are wondering where their next bite of food is coming from. They are wondering where the next drop of kerosene or coal is coming from to heat their houses while the Government has come up with a charade this weekend, costing more taxpayers' money, laughing at the vulnerable people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1170">It is what the Government is doing. It is hypocritical. The Government is opening up the Dáil on Saturday for a change of Taoiseach from Tánaiste and the other way around. It could be done during the week. Anyone here would have accommodated it during the week. Even if it was late at night or early in the morning we would accommodate it. The Government is sending people home from here on Thursday and then bringing them back up on Saturday, when there are so many people around this country waiting for us to help them in constituencies. The Government wants us to come here for a party on a weekend when people and families are depending on us to come down to help them. Constituents in Limerick are expecting me for things we had planned for the past seven months so we could be there to help them that weekend, yet the Government plans this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> Then we see the Government had has €673 million not spent. This is after the Government has penalised every small business in the country and overtaxed them. They are not able to keep the lights on nor keep the fridges on in the butchers' shops, all because the funding has been done wrong and the Government has created more and more taxes for the people, putting small businesses out of business. We have seen it tonight with housing and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. All they could mention today was Dublin housing. It was Dublin, Dublin, Dublin. I asked them about Limerick and the Minister sat down speechless. He could not open his mouth then. He forgot it was outside of Dublin. Now some are being delivered in small bits around the country, but it is small bits and the crumbs off the table. The Minister, Deputy McGrath has been elected from outside Dublin. He must represent the whole country as one and stop representing Dublin. He must come back down to the counties that put him up in this House in the first place and in the party to which he was first elected to represent.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1172">I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this topic. Once again, this large carryover demonstrates the delays by the Government in undertaking the required infrastructure that much needed by the country, including public housing. We know the delays and interruptions to capital projects as a consequence of the country dealing with Covid-19 were responsible for the significant increase in capital carryover compared with the previous year. However, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine cannot be blamed for the large carryover this year. The Minister has given no credible reason for the large carryover, and clearly this situation cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> We know that approximately €2.2 billion in funding that was announced by Ministers to much fanfare went unspent in 2021 across a number of areas, including health. We all know the problems, especially those we are having in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee and with the lack of GPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> On transport, the total figure for last year includes capital funding to the tune of €820 million, which was rolled over to 2022. There is a concern that because significant amounts of allocated moneys are not being spent, the deadlines are missed and many project targets will be missed as a result. It is especially concerning to me that the underspending in transport and health infrastructure that occurred in 2021 is occurring again in 2022. These funds should have been used on projects that were ready to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> We must also talk about the overpowering cost of electricity and what people are saying to us on the doorsteps. The Government is talking about giving people back grants or lump sums or whatever, but the question being asked of me is why the energy regulator is not controlling the cost of electricity. Day after day the electricity companies are announcing they are trebling and quadrupling their profits and they are seeking to increase the charges again in the new year. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to do something about this to stop it. Do we have an energy regulator? Do we have a Minister in charge of that? If does not seem to me there is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> I have mentioned to the Minister previously the local improvements schemes in Kerry. We have 660 schemes remaining on the list starting out in 2023. At the rate we are going, which is about 20 roads per year, I put it to the Minister that it will take us 38 more years to get through that list. Most of the people will be dead it will take that long.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">I will be long gone, although the Minister will not be because he is a young man. Those projects are listed and ready to go. They are sanctioned and approved and all we need is money. Surely if there is money that cannot be spent next year, there should be no problem with using it. Kerry County Council can do the work, and if it cannot do so, it will get contractors or whatever, but it never failed to do the work before. Back in 2004 or 2005 it did 111 roads each year, one year after the other. Someone who was a Member of the House representing Kerry at that time was able to secure that funding and ensure that where money was left over in other bank accounts or quarters, it was directed down to Kerry. It is possible to do the same now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> We have so many sewerage schemes waiting to be done and there is a lot of talk these days about the environment. It may not be nice to talk about sewerage or whatever but it is a problem, it is affecting the environment and it is stopping building. I am asking the Government to look at those things and ensure that money does not go back. The Minister is taking over as Minister for Finance at the end of the week and I wish him well in that role. I look forward to asking the Minister for things for Kerry into the future. As he is a Cork man, I am sure the Minister will look favourably on us. I would hope he will do his best for Kerry. These are sensible requests. I talk about 660 roads and it is ridiculous. We must make a big dent in these next year.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1179">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. Although I understand the constitutional requirement for this Bill, to provide legal authorisation for all of the expenditure that has occurred this year on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil and to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into next year in the period before the Dáil votes on the 2023 Estimates, I do not fully support the content of this legislation. There are many reasons for this, the main one being that I do not agree with certain spending detailed in this legislation as well as the lack of spending in some important areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> I am concerned about the lack of capital funding, particularly in my constituency of Donegal. There are various projects we had hoped to see progressed in the county but, sadly, little has been happening. For example, I mention the Fintra bridge development in Killybegs, which will include a new bridge across the Fintra river, a pedestrian and cycle route and road realignment works. Although we are finally seeing some progress on this, the development has been a long time coming and is moving at snail’s pace. The real expenditure will only come in the next year or two and we will have to see whether that will be provided to make the developments happen. There are many areas in Killybegs that are in desperate need of funding and development, such as the community hospital. Killybegs is an example but this goes right throughout the county. I have spoken before about the hospital’s potential to do more to support the Killybegs community, as well as the surrounding communities, and how the lack of funding, resources and development have led to an underutilised hospital with limited services and staff available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> Killybegs and the surrounding areas are also experiencing a severe lack of gardaí and Garda vehicles. It is important that gardaí are around and available in our rural communities, and much of Donegal has been let down in this aspect. Quite often gardaí are not available in the south-west Donegal area until 7 p.m., and when they are on duty, there are only two gardaí covering a large area between Killybegs, Kilcar, Ardara and Glenties. There could be one garda on duty in Killybegs and one garda on duty in Glenties, with no squad car between the two of them so they basically cannot go anywhere, do anything or patrol. Chief Superintendent Terry McGinn recently outlined to the Donegal joint policing committee how a lack of vehicles is proving to be a major obstacle for gardaí in Donegal. She has made several applications to Garda Headquarters. However, she was told no cars would be purchased until the new year at the earliest. She said the lack of cars was "affecting the service", which is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> The Donegal joint policing committee also recently heard of the removal of 16 gardaí from the Donegal divisional drugs unit, despite the fact that drug crime is on the increase in the county. The number of gardaí serving in the drugs unit dropped from 21 to five within a year and the unit has also been left without an unmarked car. They cannot get around either, so unless crime is happening in the barracks, it will not be detected anywhere. Superintendent McGinn has said that the lack of resources is making responding to emergency calls and carrying out drug operations difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183"> This Government has failed to deliver for the people of Donegal in areas such as these time and again. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke about the local improvement scheme and this is a big problem in Donegal too as we have huge lists that will take donkey's years to be resolved and dealt with. They probably will not be dealt with but people still have to be let apply when it is known they will not get their roads improved or sorted out at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> The recent reports of an underspend of nearly €500 million in the Government’s housing budget is shocking and completely unacceptable in the midst of a housing crisis. I have constituent after constituent coming to me with concerns regarding housing, including mica, the years-long waiting list for social housing, the lack of rental accommodation in Donegal, and the inability to buy a house. To hear that millions of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's budget is not being spent to help these people in need is so frustrating to me. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm to the House what he expects the underspend in housing to be this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> I support this Bill on the basis it is necessary legislation to provide money and resources that are required to run our public services. However, I would again like to emphasise that I do not agree with the allocation of a lot of the spending detailed in this legislation and I completely condemn the underspending trend we have been seeing in recent years, especially in the area of housing. There is no excuse for it and it needs to end today.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Michael McGrath)<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1186">I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate. There is broad support for this Bill, which is an important one in the annual budgetary calendar to ensure there is proper legal underpinning of expenditure in the current year. It is also important in ensuring there is legal provision for expenditure to continue next year until the relevant Oireachtas committees consider the Estimates and then for this House to vote on those Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> A range of issues have been raised by colleagues. Deputy Mairéad Farrell raised the process of public procurement and made some suggestions in that regard. Deputy Nash spoke about the need to improve parliamentary involvement in the budgetary process. I would make the case that we have strengthened the role of Parliament in the budgetary process in recent years. He referenced the Parliamentary Budget Office and the role of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I have made ourselves available on every occasion we have been asked to discuss and account for our work in that regard. He also raised the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, and I confirm to him it will be backdated to 1 September. Deputy Shortall raised the issue of the cost of living and said the Government described the budget as a giveaway budget. We made no such description. We described it a cost-of-living budget and that is a fair description of the totality of the measures we announced on budget day in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> There has been considerable commentary about capital expenditure over the course of the evening and the context of that is important. We have a large public capital programme in Ireland that has increased dramatically in recent years. It has been a conscious policy decision of Government to catch up with the European average in the public capital investment programme and then to exceed it. The fact that next year we will have about €12.5 billion speaks to the level of priority we have afforded capital investment. Having multi-annual ceilings in place and having a total envelope out to 2030 allows Departments to plan the pipeline of public capital projects over that period. Critically, it also gives industry certainty that the Government will continue to invest in housing, healthcare, transport, climate action measures and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> On the carryover, I would make the point that the importance of the carryover provision is demonstrated by the fact that, of the almost €820 million that was carried forward from 2021 into 2022, some €780 million had been spent up to the end of November.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">Where money is carried forward under the Finance Act 2004, that money is not lost but remains with the Department for spending on projects that may have been delayed in the previous year for a variety of reasons. It further strengthens the public capital envelope we have for the next year. We must always try to strike the right balance between having a robust public spending code whereby we can stand over from a value-for-money perspective investment in public capital projects and ensuring the projects get done in a timely manner. Trying to find that balance is critically important. </p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> The measures we brought forward in the current year in respect of the cost-of-living amount to in the region of €4 billion to provide assistance with rising prices. We have made provision during the year to look after the people who have come here from the terrible war in Ukraine. The cost is expected to be in the region of €1 billion for 2022 and more than half of this amount has been provided to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - mainly for accommodation supports. Approximately one third has been provided has been provided to the Department of Social Protection to provide social welfare supports. </p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> We also had to make provision during the year to deal with Covid-19. We had the Omicron wave in the early part of this year. That necessitated significant public expenditure in healthcare to make sure we were in a position to respond to what was a huge challenge. Approximately €4.75 billion was provided for measures to support the delivery of key public services and to provide support for sectors that continued to be impacted by the pandemic this year in healthcare, income and employment support schemes that were extended in the early part of the year and continued supports in the education and transport sectors to ensure they could continue to function. We extended supports for tourism and hospitality over the course of the year. </p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> Social protection always remains an important part of public expenditure. When expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund is included, 2022 gross expenditure for social protection is almost €25 billion. People will always make the case in this House for greater spending on social protection but we can be proud of the safety net in this country, which we have strengthened in the recent budget for people on low incomes and many people who are vulnerable to make sure that at least their basic needs can be looked after. </p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> The Department of Health, which had such a crucial role in our response to the pandemic and in reforming our health system, had a gross allocation of €23.6 billion in 2022. Health spending amounts for some 26% of gross voted expenditure and is an important part of public expenditure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> We spent a number of hours earlier discussing housing. In total, the amount allocated to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was almost €6 billion in 2022. That level of resourcing does reflect the priority the Government has placed on tackling the housing crisis in all its forms. </p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> Expenditure on education at just over €14 billion in 2022 between the Departments of Education, and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science accounts for almost 16% of gross voted expenditure over that period. </p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> I have dealt with the issue of capital investment. Again, I reference the fact that we introduced important changes earlier this year relating to an inflation co-operation framework to ensure that public works contracts remain a viable proposition for contractors, who were having to take on all the risk of committing to fixed-price work at a time when there was such upward volatility in terms of materials costs over that period. That has brought an important level of stability to public works contracts and has resulted in a greater level of uptake in respect of public works contracts that have been put out for public procurement. </p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> I very much welcome the support of the House that I think will be forthcoming shortly in respect of this Bill. While it may be described as an important piece of housekeeping, it is very important for the House to properly account for expenditure this year to ensure it is legally sound and robust and to ensure that payments and expenditure can continue in the early part of next year before all the various Estimates, which will be set out in the Revised Estimates Volume, are considered by the respective Oireachtas committees and then by this House. </p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1206">— the findings of the INMO on the emigration intentions of student nurses and midwives which found that 65 per cent of nursing graduates are strongly considering emigrating, and 33 per cent are considering leaving the major cities in Ireland due to the cost of living; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1207">— that in 2021, 62 per cent of first-time registrants with the Nursing and Midwifery Board were non-European Union workers, which highlights the lack of supply and poor retention of Irish trained graduates;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1208">recognises:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1209">— that without adequate recruitment and retention of nurses and other healthcare professionals our health system cannot function, and conditions will continue to deteriorate for both patients and staff;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1210">— that it is extremely difficult to encourage Irish-trained and qualified nurses, or other healthcare professionals such as general practitioners (GPs), back to Ireland, while there is such a chronic shortage of affordable housing to rent or buy; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1211">— the widely held belief amongst the public that the current Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, is incapable of addressing the crisis in our health service and has, along with the wider Government, been making the situation worse;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1216"> calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1217">— commit to urgently review its current housing plan and increase its targets for social and affordable housing to rent or buy, alongside putting one month's rent back into private renters' pockets and ban rent increases for the next three years;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1218">— offer a job guarantee to healthcare graduates;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1219">— urgently identify, examine and consider all potential mechanisms to address the cost-of-living barriers to recruitment and retention of key workers, especially in urban areas; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1220">— immediately engage with general practice to ensure GPs are supported to take more pressure off hospitals and emergency departments, especially by expanding out-of-hours services, and engage with other primary care professions, such as pharmacies, to ensure late night options are in place across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Eight long years since the incoming Taoiseach was Minister for Health, the health service is facing crises the scale of which we have not witnessed before: 1 million patients on waiting lists; a record 12,500 patients on trolleys in November 2022; and a health service that can only recruit half the staff it needs this year. These crises did not creep up on us or come out of nowhere. They are not a sudden once-in-a-century pandemic nor were they caused by that pandemic. These crises are years in the making and are the direct consequence of two decades of failed Government policy. They were caused by mismanagement of the health service, the housing market and the higher education sector by successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. It did not put the capacity in when it should have, it did not build enough homes when it could have and now it is failing to train anywhere near enough graduates to safely staff our health service. I am afraid patients are now paying the price for that. The consequence of these failures is another generation of talented young graduates who have been trained for export. When is this Government ever going to learn? </p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> The first problem is that we are not training and recruiting enough healthcare professionals and the Minister for Health has accepted this many times. The Government has finally accepted this belatedly but looking at the Minister's amendment to this motion, which brags of a paltry 135 additional nursing places this year, it is clear that he lacks the ambition and vision needed to tackle this problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> The second issue is retention and this applies right across our health services. There are many reasons so many healthcare workers leave the health service and even our country. There is a severe lack of capacity, they do not have the tools or staff to do the job properly, hospitals are overcrowded and working conditions are appalling. We see it with children's disability network teams and in many other areas where we simply cannot recruit the staff that are needed to provide children and patients with the services they need. </p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> However, there is now a much more fundamental problem driving our graduates abroad and that is the housing crisis. According to a survey by the INMO, two in every three nursing and midwifery graduates are considering emigration. One third directly named the cost of living and the housing crisis as reasons they are considering changing to a workplace closer to their family home. There are major reasons many healthcare workers of all ages across professions are considering emigration. When he became the Minister for Health, the Tánaiste vowed to bring our doctors and nurses home and he failed. When Deputy Harris became Minister for Health, he promised to make sure that every nursing graduate got a job and he failed. When the current Minister for Health assumed office, he made the same hollow commitments, which have not been followed through with the action we need. When the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage assumed office, he promised ambitious targets for affordable homes, yet not a single affordable home to buy was delivered in 2020 or 2021, with only a trickle expected this year. </p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> It is not only new graduates who are being driven to emigrate by the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">One nurse living in County Louth wrote to me, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1227">I'm 33. My husband is 34. We both live in the garage of my parents' house. We're considering emigrating next year. Australia has so much more has so much more to offer - better working conditions as a nurse, better opportunities to save and a better lifestyle. It is a shame, as Ireland is our home, but we will never make it on to the property ladder by staying here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> The housing crisis is also stopping students from even completing their courses. In the words of one former student nurse:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1229">I was studying and training to be a nurse in Dublin. The rent was extortionate for a bed in someone's shed. I was waking up at 4.30 in the morning to commute to Dublin to be there for 7.30 for my shift. I finished at 8.30 p.m. and arrived home at midnight to get up again at 4.30 the following morning. I dropped out due to sheer exhaustion. If the rent was cheaper or if there was some form of affordable housing, I may have continued my studies and I may have qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">The Government's failure to tackle the housing and the cost-of-living crisis is forcing young nurses and midwives to emigrate, stopping others from coming home and preventing others from even qualifying in the first place. If that is not a disaster or an emergency, I am not sure what is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> Sinn Féin has a plan to fix the housing crisis and to deliver more affordable homes. We have a plan to cut rents and freeze them. We would increase targets for social and affordable housing to rent and buy. We would put one month's rent back into renters' pockets and ban rent increases for the next three years. We also have a plan to fix the health service. We would increase the number of healthcare training places and give a job guarantee to healthcare graduates, including those who go abroad, so we can entice them back. We would invest in hospital equipment. We need more beds and more surgical theatre capacity. We must give those in our healthcare sector the tools to do the job. We would address the cost-of-living barriers to the recruitment and retention of key workers, especially in urban areas, in sectors like housing, transport, energy and childcare. Sinn Féin would invest in healthcare capacity to give workers the tools to do the job and give patients the dignity and the health service they deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_1232">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Cullinane as ucht an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála anocht. I had to double-check these figures, but last month, 1,108 patients at Letterkenny University Hospital, LUH, languished on hospital trolleys without beds. That is a disgrace. It is the third most overcrowded hospital in the State, and the situation is getting worse by the week. When Fine Gael took office back in 2011, there were 81 patients without access to LUH that November. In November 2022, there were 1,108. That is a disgraceful figure and shows just how out of control the health service has become under both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. This level of overcrowding is dangerous not only for staff but also for patients. Yesterday, LUH announced it was cancelling elective surgery due to pressure on bed availability. Patients, nurses and hospital staff deserve better. On a local radio station we heard a mother, Tanya, speak about her son, Oisín, who has cerebral palsy. He waited for 32 hours in the hospital without getting a bed. Eventually, Tanya was so tired and distressed at seeing her son in that situation that she took him home, only to be told later that he had pneumonia. She did not risk going back to that hospital, because it was over capacity and under serious stress. She only had praise for the doctors and nurses in the hospital, who are run off their feet. Tanya and Oisín's story is all too familiar to us in County Donegal and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> The overcrowding has created conditions that have caused a recruitment and retention crisis to deepen. This vicious cycle needs to be addressed. The housing failure of the Government has now seeped into every corner of our public services, including our hospitals. A recent survey published by the INMO found that two out of three nursing graduates are considering emigrating. Our nurses deserve better than that. They deserve to be able to look forward to safe working conditions and an affordable place to live. The reality is that there are issues with recruitment and retention not only in Dublin, but also in rural parts of County Donegal. We talked earlier about how the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is failing. Let me say this again. There were 1,100 people waiting for a bed in LUH last month. That is a failure by any stretch of the imagination. The Minister needs to get his act together on behalf people like Tanya and Oisín who had to go home after waiting 32 hours in a hospital because they could not even get a bed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">We must ask ourselves how we got to a point where we have the highest level of 25- to 29-year-olds being forced to live with their parents. Some 60.9% of that age cohort do not have a place to live independently. That is almost double what it was previously. That is shameful. Over 5,000 leaving certificate students put nursing or midwifery as their first preference on their CAO application. It is not that young people do not want to become nurses and midwives; it is that the State is failing to provide training. We have both the need and the demand for these course places. That is why Sinn Féin would increase the number of places by 250 this year and continue to increase numbers until there are 2,500 new entrants annually. Almost 4,000 students enrol in pre-nursing courses every year with little hope of being able to study nursing at degree level. We are absolutely failing them. If a student enrols in a pre-nursing course, they are interested in nursing and want to be a nurse. There is every chance that they would make an excellent nurse. Yet, we do not give them the opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> I also want to raise the issue of the lack of home care and home care workers. A woman in my constituency, who is an amputee and a wheelchair user, was discharged from a HSE nursing home at the end of November without any care package. Only later was she informed that the home care package had been agreed on paper, but they have no one to cover her area. Since coming home she has had two falls from the wheelchair, one at night, when her wheelchair landed on top of her. Thankfully, she was able to use her panic button. She is now back in hospital again. I am working with other people who are essentially stuck in hospital because they have no home help hours that would allow them to go home. Some have even been charged for the extra time they have had to spend in hospital. I know the staff in the home care units are going above and beyond, but the system is falling apart. The reason it is falling apart is that we have not planned. We have not planned for the labour required. For every little thing that is done at this point, the Government spends more time patting itself on the back than it does sorting out what needs to be sorted.</p>

          <p eId="para_1236">Last week it was announced that the new elective hospital in Cork will be based in Glanmire. That is something I welcomed. However, I was disappointed to learn that it will not be open and operational until 2027. There are tens of thousands of people in Cork on the waiting lists for elective surgery. It is not good enough that the earliest opportunity they will have to access treatment is 2027. We need action to be taken now. The delivery of the hospital must be fast-tracked because those people need to be treated right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> There is another issue that I wish to raise with the Minister. On 31 December, the GP from the Ashdale Centre in Blarney is retiring and the clinic is closing down. That is only a symptom of the whole crisis in GP services at the moment. I am told that GP services are closing because they cannot get any cover, and GPs are not getting the support they need. GPs are operating as businesses. They should be concentrating on providing healthcare, and not worrying about profit and loss. That is something that the Minister has failed to tackle. When one looks at the number of young doctors who are leaving these shores, one sees that hundreds of them have left this year alone. What are the Government, the Minister and the HSE doing?</p>
          <p eId="para_1238"> I will finish on this point. The funny thing is that the Fine Gael health spokesperson, Deputy Colm Burke, has stated that he regards the treatment of young doctors by the HSE as the reason they are leaving. He has also stated that the HSE fails abysmally in workforce planning, postgraduate training and retention strategies. It is on the Fine Gael website; the Minister can look it up. Fine Gael has been in power for 11 years, and Deputy Burke has said the HSE and the Department of Health need to wake up.</p>

          <p eId="para_1240">For our health service to work, the professionals who work in it should be able to live in a decent home and make a decent living out of decent wages. Right now, that is not happening, as swathes of our most talented and committed healthcare workers are being forced to emigrate because they know they cannot afford to buy or even rent a decent home. The rents they are paying for shared shoeboxes are crippling them. No matter how hard they work, the wages they are earning are just not enough to have a comfortable life in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">None of them is looking for luxury here. A decent home and a good job with a decent wage that will help make ends meet is, however, a level of comfort healthcare workers should expect in the 21st century. The Government could take action to address this. We saw how fast it moved recently to work for and indulge big bankers. Despite the inextricable link between the crisis in housing and the crisis in healthcare, however, it is choosing not to do so. Waiting lists are heaving because the housing crisis affects the healthcare crisis. They are packed with people like the young person who contacted me out of the blue. She had a series of seizures in 2021. She was sent home from the accident and emergency department and told to see what happens. What happened was more seizures and she ended up back in the accident and emergency department. This time, she was put on epilepsy medication and added to a waiting list to see a neurologist. Now, 21 months later, she still has not seen that neurologist. She has had no change in drugs and no proper diagnosis, which means she cannot drive and her life is completely on hold. This young person, a student teacher as it happens, has her whole life ahead of her but because of the absolute state of our waiting lists, she is stuck and worried that her condition is deteriorating. Going private - if she could afford to do so - is not an option. The private neurologist cannot see her because her own waiting list is so long. We do not have enough neurologists. We do not have enough medical graduates, junior doctors or nurses. They are all leaving because of the disaster that is our housing policy. That problem is going to get worse.</p>

          <p eId="para_1242">We all know the health service faces many issues from young healthcare graduates emigrating with very many not intending to come home, and more leaving Ireland because of the costs of housing and rent and the cost of living. As the Minister knows, the biggest issue in my county is the downgrading of the emergency department and ICU in Navan. Last Saturday week, there were 11 ambulances parked outside Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, because there were no beds or trolleys for people inside. I know that 17 consultants wrote to the HSE, although I am not sure if they wrote to the Minister as well, stating that it was not safe to divert patients from Navan to Drogheda and that if it happened, it could cost lives. The consultants also stated that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was 16 doctors short, there was no way they could cope with the extra patients and the move would result in the loss of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> We heard that from tomorrow, ambulances are to be bypassed from Navan to Drogheda. A review was completed two months ago and we, the elected representatives, do not have a clue what is in it. We complained from day one that the option of protecting, enhancing and investing in the emergency department in Navan hospital was not included in the review. We were very disappointed with that. We are hoping it will not happen but the only thing in the review is how best to close the emergency department and ICU in Navan hospital. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244"> As the Minister knows, we are surrounded by hospitals that are under extreme pressure. Does it not make more sense to protect and enhance the emergency department in Navan, thereby taking the pressure off Connolly Hospital and the hospitals in Drogheda, Cavan and Mullingar? In 2017, the HSE wanted to close the emergency department in Portlaoise general hospital and there was uproar from the politicians in County Laois. All we ask is that we get the same opportunity as people in Portlaoise did to protect, enhance and retain the services in Navan hospital. Perhaps if we had three Ministers in our county fighting our corner as hard as Ministers fought in County Laois, we would be able to attend our services. I ask the to address that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1245">We are here again, as we have been countless times, discussing the health crisis and the healthcare system. Each time, the Minister tells us of a plan he has to sort out the crisis and time and again, these plans never achieve their stated aims. We have told the Minister countless times in this Chamber what needs to happen to fix the waiting list and trolley crises and the lack of doctors and nurses and asked him to look at the housing crisis, which has caused many of these problems in recent times. The Minister has nodded, as every Minister does in every situation, and agreed that this needs to be done but, unfortunately, nothing happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> We now have a cost-of-living crisis that is driving our badly needed doctors and nurses to emigrate. They cannot stay and work in Ireland due to high rents, high costs of living and the staggering costs of owning a home. Parents have contacted me countless times regarding child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, because their children have been on waiting lists for years. Let us think about that. These are child and adolescent mental health services and young people are on waiting lists for years. That is absolutely appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> When are we going to be presented with a comprehensive plan to fix the health system and provide one that delivers for all and not just those with the ability to pay? One of the most shocking developments in recent decades has been that while people with money can get access to health services, those without money must wait. That is a shocking indictment of this society and Governments that have created a two-tier society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> While not directly related to this debate, I will refer to an issue that really affected me when I was outside Leinster House earlier. I cannot go without mentioning the horrific abuse in the St. John Ambulance Ireland organisation and the need to immediately publish the report on the matter, as requested by the victims who stood outside in the freezing cold for hours. Nobody should have to stand outside the seat of Government and ask for a report that has already been vetted by a senior barrister. We have already been told it should be published immediately. What is the delay? I appeal to the Minister to ask the people in charge at Cabinet to do so. I believe the matter falls under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. Will the Minister please find out what is causing the delay? These people have suffered enough and should not have to suffer any longer. They want the report published immediately and that should be done.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1296">— while this is very positive, the Government acknowledges that issues have emerged over the past number of months, including those arising from the war in Ukraine, with unprecedented inflationary pressures and rising interest rates having an impact on the momentum of home delivery; </p>

          <p eId="para_1299">I thank the Deputies for tabling the motion and giving us the opportunity to discuss the real challenges facing patients and our healthcare workers and the real progress that is being made in our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300"> When it comes to healthcare, of course, everything must start and end with the patient. I assure Deputies of my absolute determination to achieve a vision to which we are all signed up, namely, universal healthcare and a public healthcare system in which everybody gets access to good quality care when they need it regardless of how much money they earn, their gender or where they live. To achieve this we need a very strong healthcare workforce. I recognise the very valuable work carried out by our health and social care professionals for so many citizens every day right across the country. We need sufficient numbers of these highly trained professionals, each of whom should be working at the top level of his or her training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301"> There are more than 16,000 more people in our healthcare service now than there were at the start of Covid-19. That is more than 5,500 extra nurses and midwives, more than 2,600 health and social care professionals and more than 1,700 more doctors and dentists. This will be the third year in a row of record recruitment into the HSE, which is an issue on which I ask colleagues to reflect. While we need to hire many more people, this year will be the third year in a row of record recruitment since the foundation of the HSE. That is an important achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302"> Earlier today, I announced a new €9 million package for student nurses and midwives that includes an annual allowance for meals and subsistence, increased accommodation allowances and increases to be paid to interns, fourth-year nurses and midwives. My understanding is that this measure has been positively received.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303"> Last week, the Government approved a new public-only consultant contract. I acknowledge Deputy Cullinane's public support for that. It is important that a strong message comes from the Oireachtas that it stands behind this contract, and I recognise Sinn Féin's support for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304"> I set up a task force on non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs. Good progress was made last week, and additional progress will be made in the coming weeks and months to fundamentally overhaul how NCHDs are treated in the public health service. Their treatment is completely unacceptable and must change. That change has started. We have a long way to go. We all want Ireland's public health service to be recognised as one of the best places in the world for doctors to come to train and stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305"> Of course we need to do more. We need to set Ireland on a path of self-sufficiency when it comes to having enough healthcare professionals in the years and decades ahead. Deputies across the floor are right that we do not train enough healthcare professionals in this country. In fact, we do not even come close. We need to radically increase the number college places in healthcare in Ireland. I believe we need to double them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">In July, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I announced the creation of an additional 200 medical places per year. That will be phased in. There will be an extra 135 places for nursing from September. We have more than doubled the number of GP training places and will keep increasing that year on year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307"> I met recently with senior teams in four universities to discuss this vision of doubling healthcare college places. I was impressed and pleased at the reaction. There is a real appetite from the third level sector to grow and expand college places in medicine, nursing, midwifery, health and social care professionals, dentistry, pharmacy and across the board. We need a radical approach to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> I acknowledge the serious pressures faced in emergency departments by patients, their families and healthcare workers. We are not unique in this. Deputies across the floor will be aware of the pressures faced in other jurisdictions around us, namely, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. The number of people attending emergency departments has gone up a lot since before Covid. This is particularly the case among older people, who are coming in with more complex needs, who need more care and who tend to stay in hospital longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309"> I was surprised that the Sinn Féin motion does not mention Covid. There are pressures. I am the first to admit it and I am spending every hour of every day working to make things better for patients and healthcare workers, but to table a motion like this after the worst healthcare crisis in the world in 100 years and not mention the pandemic lacks credibility. Right now, we are dealing with Covid, flu, RSV, strep A and all the usual winter pressures.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1311">We have addressed recruitment, but the motion refers to emergency departments as well. It is not credible to talk about emergency departments pressures without referring to Covid. Combining the numbers for Covid, flu and RSV about a week ago, there were about 800 patients involved. We are seeing significant increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> There are things we can do and are doing. On vaccines, for example, I was happy to see that new reporting from the ECDC shows that, as of 2 December, Ireland has the highest uptake of vaccines for the 60-plus population, for which our healthcare professionals and those who take the vaccines deserve great credit. The winter plan is helping. We would love to see more, but a lot is happening. There has been a significant increase in the sanctioning of emergency medicine consultants and healthcare professional and nurses in emergency departments according to the safe staffing framework. The winter plan funds the recruitment of an extra 600 staff, which is relevant. It increases the work of community intervention teams, GP out-of-hours services and supports, community and acute diagnostics, which has been a success, and the expansion of ambulance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313"> While there is nothing normal about the pressures faced by our emergency departments at the moment in the context of Covid, post Covid and all of that, we all know we need a healthcare service with sufficient capacity and working in the right ways to cope with normal winter pressures. We have not had that for a very long time. That is what we are building up capacity to do. What have we done? Since the Government was formed, we have added over 900 hospital beds and increased ICU capacity by about a quarter. We are ahead of the Sláintecare target profile for hospital beds and will keep going. We have caught up and are on target for ICU beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314"> Is all this investment making a difference where it really matters, namely, not just in emergency departments but, as Deputies have referenced, with regard to waiting lists? Yes. We focused on people waiting too long, that is, numbers waiting more than 18 months, 12 months, six months or in the context of the targets set out in Sláintecare. Good progress is being made as we come out of Covid. For example, the number waiting more than a year for outpatient appointments over the past two years has gone down by a third despite Covid. For inpatient and day cases, the number waiting more than six months in about the last two years has gone down by about a third. The biggest improvement has been in patients waiting for scopes. The number waiting more than six months in the last two years is down by more than 70%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315"> Are we where we need to be? No, because we are all signed up to the Sláintecare targets, but significant reductions are being seen as we come out of Covid and capacity becomes available. We have a long way to go. Particular areas are doing very well. I presume Deputy Cullinane took the lead in writing the motion, so I will go to the example of University Hospital Waterford, the Deputy's local hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_1319">It is down to good management. It is down to excellent leadership by management and by some of the consultant teams. They have some of the resources they need. In Waterford hospital, the outpatient list has come down by more than 20% in the past year. Over the past two years, it has added more than 200 staff and opened a see and treat gynaecology clinic. Last November, there were women waiting more than two years for gynaecology appointments. In Waterford, that has gone from 24 months to nine. It continues to fall. The new cath lab will be open soon. There is a new modular built emergency department, ophthalmology theatre, MRI replacement laboratory extension, outpatient build. When I was there we spoke about a new 160-bed ward block. That is one hospital and one example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> I fully accept that we have a long way to go. I see the pressures every day for patients, but let us think of the progress being made. Progress like that is being made across the board. We have to back our healthcare workers, invest, grow the workforce and help them run the service as well as possible because other hospitals are capable and others are doing what Waterford is doing. We know much more progress needs to be made but really good progress is now being made. My job, as well as that of Government and of us all here, is to keep doing what is right to get patients care when they need it. </p>

          <p eId="para_1323">I was interested to hear the Minister’s comments on Waterford hospital. I wish everybody who uses that hospital all the best. The Minister praised the management team there. I wish I could say the same for my hospital, University Hospital Limerick. I have been talking about it probably on a weekly basis since I was elected in 2016 with different health Ministers through Topical Issues, priority questions, Questions on Promised Legislation, committees or anywhere I could raise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324"> One figure I want to give the Minister, to repeat and to repeat repeatedly is that this year so far, 16,904 people have waited in trolleys in Limerick. That is a scandal. There is no other trolley count anywhere close to these figures There is no plan to get us out of it. We will build a 96-bed unit which the Minister and the HSE have confirmed to me will deliver 48 additional beds. They will not solve the problems and they will not come for a number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> I have had difficulties with the management at the hospital in the past. I do not believe they are up to the task. I have said it on numerous occasions. I have said it to them at meetings and have said it in here. We hear Waterford has good management structure and it seems to have an impact. Limerick has a major issue with capacity and the amount of people. A total of 76,470 people attended in 2021. Today, we reached the shocking figure of 16,904 people on trolleys. I will keep raising this number because it is not just a number. These are people. Sometimes they are close family members or neighbours of mine. They are older people and younger people. The concern I have is one that nurses told me well before the current Minister for Health took office. Nurses have told me to that older people are dying unnecessarily in our hospital all the time because they are lingering on trolleys for way too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Older people are dying unnecessarily in our hospitals all the time because they are lingering on trolleys for way too long. Something has to be done. There has to be some sort of a critical emergency intervention. We have had a HIQA report, the Deloitte report and a huge number of other reports. We hear that plans will be made, but that is of no comfort to people. There is not a single day that I do not get phone calls from families in utter distress. These include elderly patients especially and children who are waiting in University Hospital Limerick. These are particularly older people who are abandoned in our hospital, and it is simply not good enough. The Minister will remember the 16,904 people</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">Housing and health have become intertwined into one big mess and that has happened on Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s watch. Government policies in health and housing over the past decade have brought us to a crisis. We are now facing a brain drain from the health service like we have never seen before. A perpetual crisis in the health service under this Government is forcing nurses and midwives to emigrate. A staggering 65% of nursing graduates are considering emigrating. A third of them have already been approached by overseas agencies for recruitment abroad. When I speak with staff who are working in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and St. Vincent’s Hospital, Fairview, in my constituency in Dublin Bay South, the loss of healthcare staff to emigration is the number one concern they raise with me. Nurses and midwives working in these hospitals should be able to live relatively close by. It is just not right that they are completely priced out of the housing market. It is not right that these essential workers are forced to commute for hours to reach work each day. The rents and prices around St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, give staff no hope. The high-tech boom has contributed to the forcing of staff and working families out of their communities. These essential workers do incredible work every day caring for patients but year after year the Government fails to look after them. We need to see a step change in how the Government views nurses and midwives. We all remember the last Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his comments around financial penalties against striking nurses and for nurses and midwives who are merely seeking better conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328"> Sinn Féin has a plan to fix the housing emergency. Sinn Féin also has a plan to fix the health emergency and we need a change of Government for that to happen. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly that we must ensure the Geoffrey Shannon report on the St. John Ambulance is published as a matter of urgency. St. John Ambulance should not be allowed to sit on this particular report. Sex abuse survivors should not be silenced.</p>

          <p eId="para_1329">Healthcare workers are the backbone of our health system. When we talk about the severe and persistent issue due to Government failure without within our health system we primarily think about the impact on patients. However, we should also consider the intense pressure and stress levels involved in working in such a broken system. This is what our healthcare staff contend with on a daily basis to keep our health system going. This emergency is experienced across all regions of the country. This week alone, there were 22 patients on trolleys in Wexford General Hospital. Less than two months ago, consultants in emergency medicine at Wexford General Hospital stated that the emergency department is under ferocious pressure and is currently seeing between 160 and 180 patients per day. The new 96-bed ward that had been promised by the Government for the hospital must be delivered on time. However, the problem will be with retaining and recruiting the staff to operate these beds. This must be integrated into this planned extension and must be fully guaranteed by the Government. Our health service would not function without the hard work and commitment of our trainee nurses. In a fully staffed, well-functioning national health service, the only pressure that trainee nurses should be under is worrying about securing their degree. Despite the best efforts of teaching hospitals and staff, student nurses are coming under more and more pressure from heavy workloads and the enormous rising rents and accommodation, not to mention the cost of living. This is not right. After exhausting, sometimes double shifts, healthcare staff exit the hospital door and walk straight into a crisis in housing and the cost of living. People wonder why so many choose to emigrate. Average rents in County Wexford are now €1,211. The pandemic bonus payment, which was supposed to reward all our healthcare staff for working under extreme conditions, still has not been paid out to some. The housing disasters are preventing many healthcare workers from returning home to Ireland and it is contributing to young graduates exiting as soon as they qualify. Those who manage to stay here are barely keeping their heads above water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> It is a sad situation when you hear a Minister of State come into this House and quote my local newspaper that denigrates decent hard working councillors, making references to Mickey Mouse, when they are raising the same serious issues about how the housing crisis affects their constituents. The Government must take decisive, drastic action on these matters, as this motion calls for. We need a national health service that covers the whole of Ireland, all of the island, that values and pays good wages to the people who work in our hospitals and give world-class care to all our citizens.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1331">This motion tonight highlights the terrible situation our health system is currently in and puts forward real solutions that can assist in turning this around. A recent survey carried out by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, found that 65% of nursing graduates are currently considering emigrating due to the cost of living. This Government has failed to tackle the cost-of-living and the housing crises. This is forcing healthcare workers to emigrate and preventing many others from coming home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> On the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, a census was carried out by the HSE just over a year ago, which found that 30% of staff places are vacant. That has not been addressed during the year. The CDNTs are simply not capable, given this level of understaffing, of carrying out their role in the delivery of assessment of need and follow-on therapies for disabled children. Also, we know there are insufficient numbers of GPs. Constituents are telling me that they cannot get appointments in the local primary healthcare centre. They are ringing and ringing and no one answers. Eventually, if they get an appointment and get blood tests done, they have to then ring back in to get those results. Then they are referred to a doctor if there is an issue of concern. To me that makes no sense. Some people are giving up because they cannot get through and it is possible that serious issues are being ignored and are not being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333"> The Minister has failed to put a workforce plan in place to deal with the issue of recruitment and retention in the health service and this has to be addressed. It is also the case that where you live determines what treatment you receive. A child in my constituency - and I have raised this issue with the Minister before - was informed that she could not receive an insulin pump because she was being treated in Cavan General Hospital but that she could receive one if she transferred her treatment to Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda or to CHI at Temple Street. This motion also highlights the complete failure of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, to tackle the housing crisis that has forced so many healthcare professionals to emigrate and to prevent them from returning. The Government has to commit to urgently review its current housing plan, to increase its targets for social and affordable housing for renting and buying, to reduce rents and to ban rent increases for a number of years. This also demonstrates a total failure by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to ensure that adequate numbers come through, as well as training and course places for healthcare professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334"> In reply to a recent parliamentary question, I was informed that in this academic year only an additional 17 places were created in physiotherapy and none was created in occupational therapy or in speech and language therapy. The Government must ensure that there are adequate numbers of training and course places for healthcare professionals to fill the major gaps in our health service workforce. It must urgently identify, examine and consider all potential mechanisms to address the cost-of-living barriers to recruitment and retention of key workers and offer job guarantees to healthcare graduates. I support this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1336">I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. We have a crisis in our health service, as the motion states. According to the INMO, more than 12,600 people were without beds in Irish hospitals in November. It was the worst November on record for hospital overcrowding, and there were only two days in that month when fewer than 500 people were admitted to hospital without an inpatient bed. For the first time, there was a month in which more than 560 children were admitted without a bed in our hospitals. In my constituency, Tallaght hospital had 35 people on trolleys this morning. Recently, Drogheda hospital had 11 ambulances with patients queueing outside, not only because of a lack of beds but because of a lack of trolleys. More than 27,000 people left the State's emergency departments before being treated during a three-month period this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> At University Hospital Limerick, 72 doctors recently signed a letter warning of persistent overcrowding and unsafe working conditions putting patients at risk. The letter highlighted several near misses at the hospital's acute medical unit, where doctors say patients almost died due to understaffing and a lack of medical cover. The letter states patients have had to wait more than ten hours for a bed in the unit without any medical attention, while other lost patients are sometimes missed and left unseen by a doctor for days. The doctors have made a protected disclosure detailing their grievances because previous warnings have not been acted on by the hospital and because of a climate of fear of retribution. Such is the state of the country's emergency departments and of our hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> Waiting lists are a chronic problem. Recently, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, stated that one in 12 children in the State was on some form of hospital waiting list due to growing hospital staff vacancies and worsening capacity deficits. That is 98,000 children on some form of NTPF waiting list, with more than one in four of them waiting longer than a year for treatment or assessment in public hospitals. It also stated that 21 additional children had been added to waiting lists for scoliosis-related surgery since the start of the year. In September, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, stated that waiting lists might increase by more than 20,000 in 2022, instead of the target reduction of 132,000, while the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has warned that the winter plan has, increasingly, become a media exercise rather than a meaningful intervention to alleviate the year-round pressures on our health service. The president of the IMO has stated, “It’s now more about branding than a meaningful intervention to deal with the capacity issues, workforce crisis and patient waiting lists.” The yawning gap between Government rhetoric and the lived reality of all those people who experience the broken health service has never been wider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339"> Added to that is the housing crisis, which is also now having a major effect on the health service. The Dáil just voted confidence in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The consistently failed policies are going to continue, but the consequences are being seen in education and healthcare. The INMO has stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1340">The lack of suitable available accommodation and increasing rents is having a hugely negative impact on our ability to retain nurses and midwives not just in Dublin but in other cities and towns where there is significant pressure on the rental market.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1341">Affordable accommodation in close proximity to healthcare settings should not be a pipe dream for nurses and midwives who work long hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">Many hospitals have land that is suitable for the development of such accommodation. We also need to give serious consideration to accommodation allowances for nurses and midwives working in urban areas to compensate for the high cost of rent and housing in our cities and large towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> Approximately 200 nurses and midwives have remained absent on sick leave due to long Covid. It is shameful that the special leave with pay scheme was ended. The Minister for Health must ensure the incomes of the workers affected will be protected. The fundamental cause of all this is that there is a two-tier and fragmented health service and a chronic lack of capacity and staffing in emergency departments, acute and elective hospital services, ICU, public health teams, primary care and GP services, mental health, disability services - I could go on and on. We have one of the lowest number of public hospital beds on a population basis and the fewest specialist doctors <i>per capita</i>, both about 40% less than the EU average. Dr. Brian Turner of Cork University Business School has stated that the health service is having to ration care, through long waiting lists and wait times, as a result of serious capacity and resourcing deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> Thousands in the health service have still not received the Covid bonus. There is a dramatic underfunding and underinvestment in our public health service, yet this morning the Blackrock Clinic group reported that its income had increased by 21.5% in 2021 and that its profits had doubled. Just like with the housing crisis, a wealthy minority is doing very well. We need to invest properly in our public health service, take the Blackrock Clinic and other private hospitals into public ownership and build a single-tier, public, national health service, free at the point of use and funded by progressive taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">In this country, screening for bowel cancer starts at age 60. That is not nearly good enough. In France and Germany, it starts at 50, while the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that screening at 50 be reduced to 45. Ours is at 60, however, and 2,800 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year while 1,000 people die from it. I support the campaign being waged by my constituent, John Paul Ricken, who lost his wife Susan to bowel cancer. John Paul says this country is way behind the curve and he is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">He says there is a need for a big increase in public investment; he is right. He says that the screening age must be radically reduced in line with best practice internationally. The motion points to the trolley crisis, the emigration of nurses and health staff and the affordable housing crisis. To retain health staff, we need to get them housed near hospitals and health centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347"> Clearly a fightback is needed. I urge health service workers and health service campaigners in this State to look at what is happening in Northern Ireland at the moment. On Thursday morning, I will travel to Belfast where I will spend the day standing on picket lines with health service workers, campaigning for real pay increases and to defend the National Health Service, a service that was won by the struggles of working-class people and built around the idea of a health service for people, not for profit, which would provide healthcare to all people from cradle to the grave. That health service has been run down by both Tory and Labour governments alike over the decades but in particular the past ten years of Tory rule where cuts in investment, lowering of pay and privatisation have been a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> Of course, on the issue of pay, just as the Minister did in this State, Tory ministers praised health service workers as heroes and urged them to be clapped on the back while their conditions worsened. Workers on picket lines are suggesting if they worked in Tesco stores, their pay would not reduce much and it would be a much less stressful job for them. After ten years of austerity, they want inflation-busting pay increases. These strikes are not just about pay but also about defending the National Health Service. It is not possible to have a proper public health service when the staff are burned out. The service cannot recruit and retain staff. It is not possible to have safe levels of staffing because of the huge waiting lists and the stress the staff are under to provide the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> The comments of the Tory Party chairperson that the strikes are divisive and would help Putin were disgraceful. Many Northern Ireland politicians will be on the picket lines for photo opportunities in coming days. All these politicians, including Sinn Féin politicians by the way, are supporters of the Bengoa report, which has been described by health service campaigners and trade union activists in the health service in the North-----</p>

That would involve co-ordination between workers in the struggling health service, the railways, the post office and elsewhere. It would also mean increased co-ordination of health service workers, all striking together on the one day. That is what is needed. That would be a real step forward and would be a step towards a 24-hour general strike throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. That is what is needed as a next step.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1353">In recent days, I spoke to the family of an elderly man who went to a GP with a respiratory illness. He went to the GP centre to look for an appointment with the doctor and was told to come back in January. Yesterday, I spoke to 79-year-old woman who has an infection. She rang the GP and was told to come back in January. Last night she rang the doctor on call but there was no answer from the doctor on call for the hour and a half she waited on the line. Today, she has spent all day in bed because there is nothing else she can do. Last week I spoke to someone in Ballivor who had rung the north-east doctor on call service, which is regularly not staffed because of the current unavailability of doctors. She was told to go to Castleblayney, 89 km away in heavy fog if she wanted to get to a doctor on call.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354"> Last Thursday night the paediatric emergency department in Drogheda hospital advised parents and children that it was so stuffed that they needed to wait in their cars. Some of those children had to go to sleep while waiting for the emergency department in their cars on that really cold night. On the previous Saturday, Drogheda emergency department became a long-term car park for 11 ambulances which waited for five hours to deposit their patients there because no bed, chair or trolley was available for them in that emergency department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> In our region we have a major crisis with emergency department capacity. Because of those ambulances being tied up, no ambulances were available in counties Cavan and Monaghan for an extended period on that night. In a general sense, November has been the worst month on record with 100,000 people waiting on trolleys so far this year which leads to death. There is a clear correlation between at long-term waiting in emergency departments and delayed diagnosis, delayed treatments and deaths. It is estimated that 360 people are dying in the State owing to their waiting times in emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> Workers are leaving the sector. The pressure put on workers' shoulders is forcing them to leave the sector. It is a vicious circle because it means that those who are left have a worse time in the working conditions and are therefore more likely to leave. We know there are 700 missing consultants within the health system and 897,000 people on hospital waiting lists and there were 105,000 adverse incidents in the HSE last year. These are people who have been damaged, made ill and, in some cases, made disabled or lost their lives due to adverse incidents within the HSE. In five years, €2 billion has been spent on people taking cases for negligence claims. This is a significant problem. Not all of it is the responsibility of this current regime and not all of it is the direct responsibility of the Minister. There is a cumulative effect here. A significant cause of the problem was the cutbacks after the crash in 2008 to 2010 that significantly corroded the level of resources in the hospital system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357"> Approximately 600 medically discharged patients are in hospitals today. These are patients who are fit to leave hospital to go on to a step-down facility or to go home and have a carer look after them. However, because they are not available, they are stuck in the hospitals. I recently submitted a parliamentary question to find out how much the State is paying per hour for these carers and the reply indicated that on average carers are getting €27 per hour from the State. Based on an Internet search, the average wage for a carer is €12.95, which is less than half that amount. I have to ask the Minister whether the system is working properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358"> I have spoken to him in depth about this. There is a particular crisis in County Meath at the moment, which has now rippled out to affect the whole region. As a result, on Monday there were protests in Navan, Drogheda, Cavan, Mullingar, Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh. We have the development of a national hospital campaign trying to raise the profile of what is happening in the health service due to this particular crisis. Without proper investment and unless a halt is called to HSE management, which is proceeding with its plans to reduce capacity in what is a capacity crisis, the system will get worse. The only way to increase capacity is to invest properly in the hospitals that can look after patients in emergency departments. That means more consultant cover in hospitals such as Navan. A sum of €10 million a year will provide the consultant cover necessary in places like Navan to be able to provide proper safe emergency department cover in that area. That is all it would cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359"> I believe the HSE is becoming more isolated with 17 consultants in Drogheda signing a letter saying that the HSE actions are threats to health. Four consultants in Mullingar signed a letter to say the same. Hundreds of doctors, nurses and medics in Meath have signed a petition calling on the Government to stop the process of closing down Navan emergency department. The HSE management is becoming more isolated. I urge the Minister to stand up to those managers within the HSE to stop them in their tracks and protect the health service where it counts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1360">I am delighted both Ministers are here to listen to what is being said this evening. We have a crisis throughout the country in the delivery of services. We have waiting lists and all kinds of things going on. All Members hear about it in their constituency offices. What do we do about it? I want to focus on my region and the Saolta group, which serves more than 800,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">In Galway, which is supposed to be the centre of excellence for cancer care, we are not able to deliver what we need to deliver. First of all, we do not have the infrastructure in place. The old emergency facility has been demolished and we have built a new temporary emergency department. We are going to plan for a major emergency department with a paediatric and maternity unit on top of that. We must also replace our labs in Galway and I have spoken to the Minister about this before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362"> Last week, the Minister announced the commencement of the process to deliver an elective hospital. All of this is going to cost money. If the Minister asks me where we will get the money, I will remind him that 25 years have passed since it was first mooted that Galway would become a centre of excellence. It was described as such by Government Deputies in the area at the time, but somebody forgot to pass the message on. The hospital was built in 1956. We still have the Nightingale wards with 12 beds and one bathroom. We have single bedrooms with no bathrooms in them. These are the kinds of conditions we have in Galway, which is trying to become a centre of excellence. We have a great deal of money to invest - I do not say “spend” - but we have to invest it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363"> In all, I believe we will be talking about €1.5 billion to get things right in Galway. It is not going to happen in time to save people’s lives if we continue at the pace in which we have been delivering infrastructure. For instance, the radiotherapy facility that is now being completed is 15 years in the making. That is something we cannot stand over in the future. Given the amount of investment that is needed in Galway, I suggest that the Minister needs to appoint a project management hit team that will set out a programme for delivery. Everybody in the team should be accountable for their actions to ensure the programme is delivered in a proper way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364"> The KPMG report said that we will be short 222 beds by 2030. We will be in 2023 in a couple of weeks’ time, so we have seven years to deliver on this infrastructure. The emergency department which is ready to take off has still not got the approval to go for planning permission, even though we have done the enabling works to set up the department and to get it running. We have been waiting for 18 months for a strategic assessment report to be finalised. If we continue along these lines, we will end up with more talk and less action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365"> I remind the Minister and the Minister of State that we have been seeking since 2017 to have an X-ray facility delivered into the primary care centre in Tuam. I know the Minister has given a commitment that it will be delivered some time next year. The X-ray facility in the primary care centre in Tuam, which was omitted from the design of the building, needs to be put back into it. The money for this has been sanctioned since 2017. I ask for a firm commitment that we will have no more delays on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1366">I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this very important motion to the Chamber. It gives us a chance to highlight some of the needs and deficiencies in our constituencies. In County Kerry, and in Killarney in particular, we have a critical lack of GPs to service the needs of the people across a massive area. Over 4,000 extra people - refugees and asylum seekers - have landed into Killarney in recent months. Many of these refugees are mothers with young children. They need vaccinations and all of the things that children need. Not one extra GP has been dedicated to the town of Killarney. Dr. Gary Stack, Dr. O’Regan and others are under immense pressure. They were under pressure before this current situation because they were short of staff. As a result, more people are being directed to the accident and emergency services in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee. It is having an impact there as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367"> I would like to raise a small matter in the context of the accident and emergency department. When people break or fracture a leg or a hand, they are directed by their GP to go for an X-ray. When they go for the X-ray, they are directed back up to the accident and emergency department to be seen by another doctor. This duplication and replication is not needed and is impacting the other people, including elderly people, who are waiting. There is no need for that. When a doctor gives a patient a letter saying that they need an X-ray, that is what they should get. They should not be clogging up the system; they should be given the X-ray.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368"> I welcome the 132-bed hospital for Killarney Community Hospital. I raised this when I was a member of the health board ten or 12 years ago. I honestly feel I was the first to raise this matter at that time. I am glad to see this happen because we have great doctors and nurses in Killarney, Tralee and elsewhere in County Kerry. We need to give them the best modern facilities they need to make their work that bit easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369"> We are clogging up the hospitals, including the district hospitals and University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, because of the lack of home help. People are being allocated home help hours but we do not have the people to come out and do the work. I have asked before for some of the refugees who have cars and have good English to be trained up to give them a purpose here. They are able to work like everybody else. I am asking for that to happen because I appreciate that people are very hard to get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370"> Mental health is a serious problem in our county. People are being let down. I know that suicides happen outside of the medical spectrum - they can happen unavoidably - but many people need additional mental health services, including one-to-one services. It is not good enough. What we saw with CAMHS in south Kerry, where a junior doctor was blamed, is being replicated elsewhere. It is being replicated in north Kerry even though that doctor was not there at all. This issue needs to be dealt with all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371"> Ambulance cover is being impacted because people are on trolleys. When an ambulance arrives at a hospital and cannot unload the patient, that leaves somewhere else without an ambulance. We have had several instances where sick people have been waiting for over an hour, and for two hours in some places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372"> I am glad that Deputy Michael Collins and I initiated a system where we take cataract patients up to the North of Ireland. We have operated 106 or 107 buses since December 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373"> I will raise a final issue with the Minister and Minister of State. When someone applies for a medical card and gets it because they are entitled to get it, it should be made effective from the date they applied for it. I am just asking for that to happen because some people let it go and do not look for the medical card until they get sick.</p>

          <p eId="para_1374">I am pleased to see that the Minister and the Minister of State are here. I thank them for staying on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375"> I am calling this evening for an investigation into the non-reporting of incidents at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, despite calls continually being made to stop the practice. Staff are unable to put incidents on Q-Pulse because this immediately triggers a response from management as to the origin of the incident, instead it being dealt with in a proper and professional manner as it is supposed to be done. This is not my first time to raise this matter. I know that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has been in Limerick. I met him there when he was announcing a new unit. Management personnel in University Hospital Waterford have been praised tonight for the work they are carrying out there. It is with a heavy heart that I have to come up here to talk about UHL. I know that many of the medical staff there are in desperation because of what they see happening to the hospital in which they work. </p>
          <p eId="para_1376">People who have worked for years to care for people are now leaving their positions. The roll-over of staff in emergency services shows the Minister what is happening. People have worked in emergency services for five or ten years, but are now leaving because they feel they cannot stay any longer as it is affecting their health and that of their families due to the fact they are coming home worn down and feel they have not done enough to protect the people in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377"> The recruitment of staff is one issue, but retention of staff who have been there for years and want to stay but have left because they have no faith in the management of the hospital is another. We saw what happened in England when independent investigations were done outside of the hospital structure, which here is the HSE. Independent investigations which do not have past or current HSE staff on investigation boards are needed. Issues were highlighted in England and prosecutions were brought. The same needs to happen in UHL.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378"> I have spoken of one case, Jessica Sheedy, an 18-year-old girl who died in UHL. The investigation into her death has been going on for more than three years. Parts of the report have been changed four or five times and the family still have not learned the real facts. The family want to make sure, in the name of Jessica, that no other family goes through what they went through. They want lessons to be learned and mistakes, if they were made, to be rectified for the protection of other people who go to the hospital and staff. If a staff member feels that he or she cannot put something on Q-Pulse because management will target them for doing so, how will anyone learn? I ask the Minister and Minister of State to address this. I would be the first to stand up and praise anyone who can help UHL fix the management structure in place there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379"> Last week I heard from a woman in her 70s who fell and cut her leg. She contacted a GP who was not working. She contacted Shannondoc and was told it was not open. She contacted the hospital which said it would send out her an ambulance, which brought her in. There was no doctor on duty at night to see her. She sat in the waiting room with her daughter and then her son came in. At 4 a.m. the son got mad and asked the staff to do something. A trainee doctor asked if he could take a picture of the woman's leg to send it to a senior doctor as he was only a trainee. Only a trainee doctor was on call, which is not fair to the trainee, staff or patients. </p>
          <p eId="para_1380"> I beg the Minister and Minister of State to investigate the management structure in the hospital. I would be the first person to praise them if they could help to stabilise and help the staff report incidents and ensure they are examined properly in order to save lives.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T22:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1381">Our health service is at breaking point and if this Government does not do something very drastic very soon, it will only deteriorate further. I have been continually raising concerns regarding Letterkenny University Hospital and the seemingly continuous scaling back of essential services there. The staff at the hospital are expected to work under severe pressure constantly and it is not sustainable or acceptable. This is the main reason so many healthcare workers from Donegal are choosing to leave the county and country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382"> I have been informed by Letterkenny University Hospital this morning that due to the pressures on the site and the lack of bed capacity, the hospital is postponing a number of elective day cases and inpatient adult procedures. This is completely unacceptable and tells of the extremely stressful environment that workers have to endure. The INMO has reported that 64 patients were waiting on trolley beds in Letterkenny University Hospital yesterday. Some 30 patients were waiting in the emergency department and 34 were in wards elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383"> Kingsbridge Private Hospital has opened a premises in Letterkenny and is providing medical treatment. Across the Border, a private hospital is expanding due to all of the patients that are being diverted from Letterkenny to private services as Letterkenny is underfunded. The problem is that as more people are diverted to private hospitals for routine operations the ability to retain and train doctors declines because they are the bread and butter operations that keep doctors in position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384"> Any Deputy who has properly spoken with and listened to their constituents will not be shocked at the INMO findings that 65% of nursing graduates are strongly considering emigrating. Donegal cannot afford to lose any more healthcare staff or young people. If something is not done, there will be no one left to tend to our sick in the county, and that is a very frightening thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385"> I would like to take this opportunity, while addressing this issue, to urge the Government to seek a review of job upgrades for domestic and household staff at Letterkenny University Hospital, as they have been unfairly left behind in receiving pay increases, following the recent job evaluations. This Government needs to do all it can to keep the hospital staff we have and value the important work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386"> I would also like to address the lack of mental health services available in Donegal, in particular for members of the Traveller community. The statistics on Traveller men’s mental health are shocking. Last week I attended the launch of the Traveller men's health and well-being research in Letterkenny, where the results of qualitative research on Traveller men’s mental health and their challenges and experiences in Donegal was launched. The launch reminded me of the severe difficulties that the community is forced to face every day. Despite constituting less than 1% of the Irish population, Traveller males account for 10% of young male suicides and the study showed that more than half of the participants reported experiencing suicidal thoughts or attempting suicide in the past. The study detailed the negative experiences Traveller men had with their GPs and mental health services, which created a sense of distrust and discouraged them from seeking help. Many of these experiences were sadly due to bias and discrimination and the experiences were particularly negative for Travellers from the LGBTQI community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387"> We need to do better. The way we treat minority groups in this country is just not good enough, and I would like to echo Senator Eileen Flynn’s calls for a culturally appropriate policy on Traveller mental health. Successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Governments have failed the Traveller community time and time again and it is about time that important voices, such as Senator Flynn's, were listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388"> This needs to happen at a national level, but also at a community level. I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Government to invest further in community health services. It makes sense to ensure good community healthcare, not only because it would significantly benefit the community but also because it would take the pressure off the regional and national hospitals. </p>
          <p eId="para_1389"> Killybegs Community Hospital for example, has great potential. However, the hospital is under-utilised, with a very long waiting list for long stay beds and with most departments only running a few days a week with skeleton staff. Community health services need to be prioritised and we need to ensure a better healthcare system for all who work in and use it. I support this motion put forward today by Sinn Féin, and I support the motion’s call to offer a job guarantee to healthcare graduates and its call for the Government to engage with GPs to ensure they are supported to take more pressure off hospitals and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390"> However, I do not believe the motion goes far enough in addressing the needs of community health services or mental health services. We tend to prioritise other health services before we consider our mental health. It is important to remember that health, according to the World Health Organization, is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. This is something for us all to consider in making sure we look after our health services as a whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_1391">I thank Deputies across the House for their contributions to the debate. I wish to acknowledge the points raised regarding the challenges that our emergency departments are currently experiencing due to increased service demands. I also wish to acknowledge the invaluable work carried out by our health and social care workers in providing health services to patients. As we are here talking about challenges and the current issues affecting health services, I am conscious that all over the country tonight in our acute and community hospitals, nursing units, nursing homes and Caredoc services, nurses, doctors and healthcare workers are all working, and they will work through the night to make sure that our families and loved ones are looked after. That has to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">There are more than 135,000 people working in healthcare in this country. I am often conscious that when we come into the Dáil and speak about challenges, those people should be acknowledged because they are all doing the very best they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393"> As Members have heard from the Minister for Health, it is clear that emergency departments are experiencing significantly increased demand. Attendances and admissions have both increased significantly above five-year averages. That is due to a combination of factors, including the circulation of RSV, flu, Covid and strep A.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394"> To ensure that our acute and community services are supported this winter, the HSE winter plan for 2022-23 represents investment of up to €169 million and includes the recruitment of 51 emergency medicine consultants and associated support staff; full implementation of the safe staffing framework for adult emergency care settings; the recruitment of an additional 608 staff across the health service; increased community intervention teams, GP supports and out-of-hours services to reduce the need for attendances at EDs; increased community services for mental health, disability and palliative care; increased community and acute diagnostics; and expansion of ambulance services, including the introduction of nine pathfinder teams and deployment of rapid handover teams to improve ambulance turnaround times. In recognition of the volume and complexity of service demands EDs are experiencing, this winter plan adopts a bottom-up approach involving bespoke individual local plans that seek to address hospital-specific issues, in conjunction with community healthcare organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395"> The Government has delivered record funding to permanently increase capacity in our health service. There has been a significant increase in hospital bed capacity, with an additional 934 acute beds provided since 2020. An additional 82 beds were added to this plan over the course of the past two years. This includes 72 beds - 24 in Cork and 48 in the Mater - which were set out in the National Service Plan 2022, bringing the total number of beds due to open to 1,228. The winter plan has provided 934 non-ICU acute beds nationally to the hospital system over the number available on 1 January 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> Addressing the recruitment and retention of healthcare workers in Ireland continues to be a top priority for me as Minister of State, the Minister for Health and the Government. The total health service workforce in October 2022 was 136,092 people, which was 16,000 higher than at the beginning of 2020, representing the third highest annual growth in the workforce after the large increases achieved in 2020 and 2021. We have been working intensively to expand our recruitment capacity to ensure that ambitious workforce targets can be met and to maximise the numbers recruited. This has included the expansion of international recruitment markets, targeted recruitment campaigns and streamlined recruitment processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397"> Quite a few Deputies mentioned the situation in respect of home care. Some 59,000 people received home care today. We have a waiting list of 6,200. Some 3,000 of those people are new entries on the list. Another 3,200 are people who receive home care but who might not receive the full package, especially at weekends. From January we will be recruiting outside the EU. The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I worked hard to secure 1,000 permits to encourage people outside the EU to come here and deliver home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398"> The use of private capacity was also mentioned. It is true that when we recruit private companies to deliver home care the carers are paid €27 an hour. The new tender from the HSE will be in on 1 January. Included in that tender will be the provision that any of the organisations that recruit for us privately and that deliver the services will have to pay the living wage, which is currently €12.90, plus mileage. That will be written into the tender. I hope those three measures will make a significant difference. If we got even another 500 or 600 workers, it would make a significant difference to the waiting list and would have a profound effect then on the number of people in acute hospitals waiting to be transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399"> Increased efforts have been made to retain all staff, with attractive opportunities being offered for career development and progression as well as educational and development opportunities. We have already increased consultant numbers significantly but we recognise that consultant ratios remain low by international standards. The new contract will support further recruitment and retention. The HSE will also be focused on offering prospective consultants a variety of different work patterns, as mentioned in the Minister for Health's opening comments. The NCHD task force is focused on both immediate improvements in the NCHD experience and looking towards the future medical workforce. A priority area of the task force is to inform medical workforce planning and set the policy direction for the future configuration of the medical workforce. While it is important we continue to strive to improve the day-to-day experience of those delivering health services, we also need to address the challenges in our medical workforce configuration to protect future patient care and to build a sustainable clinical workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400"> Over recent years, the Department of Health has focused on supporting, strengthening and expanding the number of undergraduates and the education and training opportunities for the health workforce. The Minister for Health and I are committed to continuing to increase the number of training places into the future to ensure a sustainable workforce planning model for Ireland. We recognise that Ireland, like many other countries, is heavily reliant on international healthcare workers. We are seeking to significantly increase domestic supply of graduates across all healthcare disciplines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401"> By integrating general practice, primary care, community-based services and hospitals, through the enhanced community care programme, we will deliver end-to-end care, keeping people out of hospital and embracing a home first approach. People who receive home care more than likely also attend day care centres and receive meals on wheels. Those three elements together support people to age well at home. The momentum behind the enhanced community care programme recruitment and implementation is significant, with more than 2,400 staff already recruited, an achievement of 70% of the total 3,500 additional staff required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402"> Along with the Minister, I again thank Deputies across the House for their contributions. I reiterate the Government's commitment to improving our health service.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_454">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T23:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1403">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sinn Féin motion. I commend Deputy Cullinane on bringing it forward. We have recruitment and retention challenges across our health service, and this Government, like previous ones, has not done enough to address them. The motion states that there is a widely held belief among the public that the current Minister is incapable of addressing the crisis in our health service and, along with the wider Government, has been making the situation worse. That statement is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404"> It is truer of the delivery of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath, than anywhere else. Government policy, as stated in the small hospitals framework document of 2013, is to close the Navan accident and emergency department and to downgrade the hospital to a model 2 hospital. The Minister has been made aware repeatedly of concerns about the safety of critically ill, unstable patients presenting at the Navan accident and emergency department. To state them clearly, however, those safety concerns are directly related to a chronic under-resourcing of acute and emergency services at Navan. For years staff were not recruited and not retained. Acute and emergency services were allowed by design to drift into a situation of precarity. Given the population of Meath, given the demand for emergency services in Meath from the people of Meath, given the physical distance to the next nearest emergency department, and given the state of overcrowding in those same emergency departments, there are no spare beds, no spare trolleys and no spare chairs. Adults are left waiting in the back of an ambulance, in a car park. Sick children have it even worse. They are sent out with their parents to wait in the car. It is not a situation that should be allowed to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405"> Incredibly, despite the protestations of clinicians working on the front line - the repeated protestations of 17 consultants, to be exact - tomorrow morning a bypass protocol will be introduced at Navan and will mark the next step in the diminution of services at Navan and a step closer to the closure of the accident and emergency department there. What of those protestations? Will they say, as the motion states, that this Minister's approach and that of the Government will make matters worse? They state clearly and repeatedly that the Government's proposals and the HSE's plan will lead to worse clinical outcomes and will put lives at risk. They point to the HSE's track record in the region: repeated promises but failure to deliver. They point specifically to a bypass protocol and the fact that there are still no full-time consultants in neurology, stroke or rheumatology. As a result, the experience of the health professionals in our region, at both Navan and Drogheda hospitals, is a negative one of repeated promises but changes implemented without the necessary staffing, capacity or additional resources for our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">The plan for Navan hospital must be one of investment and bringing it to a standard to ensure it is safe for the people of County Meath. The county has a population of in excess of 220,000 people. We know a review has been on the Minister's desk for two months at this stage. We have been very critical of its terms of reference, as the Minister knows well, but it is completely unacceptable to transfer risk from one hospital to another. Investment must be made to ensure that services are safe at Drogheda and Navan hospitals. That is the plan that must be presented and introduced. Anything other than that is a failure in my opinion.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T23:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1407">I thank all of the speakers, including the Minister and Minister of state, for their contributions. The Minister's contribution was much different from the script we were handed. It was less harsh, which may speak to the Minister's style. That is commendable but I want to address some of the issues raised in the written text, which were much more strident. I am afraid the Minister's officials or somebody over there had a bad day and decided that Sinn Féin was to be attacked for tabling a motion raising very important issues related to recruitment and retention in the health service and acknowledging the real problems we have in our emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408"> For the purpose of the record, I fully accept that Covid has had an impact on our health services. It has had an impact on the their ability to deliver healthcare in the way we would have wanted. Obviously, Covid and a number of other factors have caused the crisis in our emergency departments, which has led to the cancellation of scheduled care. This, in turn, drives up waiting lists. I think we can all accept that is the reality but we also have to accept that many of the issues related to recruitment and retention, the trolley count, which we had when the Minister was in my seat and long before, and the unacceptable waiting lists predated Covid. While I acknowledge that Covid has obviously had an impact in more recent times, it cannot be used as an excuse for the long-standing deficits in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409"> The Minister's written speech specifically mentioned Waterford. I was the author of the motion and the written reply suggests I do not accept the good work being done at University Hospital Waterford.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_456" as="#Minister_for_Health">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T23:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1410">I did not say that. I do not know what version of the speech the Deputy has.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_457">
          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T23:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1411">I know the Minister did not say it. I am talking about his written speech. In fact, it is quite the reverse. I think the work that University Hospital Waterford management has done is phenomenal and I have said for some time that it is a beacon of hope for other hospitals. We need the same level of management elsewhere. It has not only been the manager, who is really important as the person who drives on the team, but the team effort in University Hospital Waterford that has resulted in hitting the milestone of 1,000 days without having a patient on a trolley. That is phenomenal and we need the same level of management in other hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412"> As a Deputy from Waterford, I must also point out - know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will partially agree with me on this - that we had to fight for resources. The mortuary was stuck in the capital process for about seven years before it was delivered. The HSE had to be shamed into delivering it because of what was happening in the mortuary. It was not because of anything the system did. Management fought for it, as did staff. The new mortuary was hard-fought and won. The battles we had to go through took the gloss from it when it came. It was a similar scenario with the cath lab. At how many meetings did the Minister of State, before she was ever appointed, and I beg Ministers for Health to give us the service we need? We still have no plan to deliver 24-7 cardiac care. Then there was the palliative care unit, half of which had to be funded by the people of Waterford. The new Dunmore wing, which has good single isolation rooms for a hospital and made a big difference during Covid and for palliative care, also came out of a battle to get matching funding lasting many years. The people of Waterford had to put their hands in their pockets to fund it. I do not need to be reminded of how good University Hospital Waterford is because I am in there all the time. We meet hospital management and we have seen the good and the bad. We have also seen a lot of hard work done by people to get us to the point we are at today. It did not happen by accident but because of the level of campaigning by local people in the constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413"> To address the substance of the motion, we need to do more. Often, when I raise issues, the Minister's response is to say he agrees with me. Maybe in some respects he does agree with me but agreeing with somebody and doing what needs to be done are two separate things. I acknowledge lots of the additional investment that has been made in the health services recently. As the Minister said, I acknowledged the new hospital contract, which is very important and will make a big difference. I will acknowledge it if we get progress on the new contract for junior doctors, which will also be important. However, the recruitment and retention crisis in our health service will not be addressed unless we substantially increase training places. To say the heads of the universities were pleasant when the Minister met them is not a plan. The Government has to act. It has to make a policy decision that it is going to do this. While I accept our universities have a level of autonomy, the Oireachtas, as a political body, can make a decision to get serious about workforce planning. This means substantially increasing training places, ratcheting up training across all elements of healthcare and proving better opportunities for graduates to work in the public system. Some work has been done but we have an awful lot to do still to get many more of them to work in the system rather than emigrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414"> An Teachta O'Reilly, who is sitting behind me, has tabled numerous motions on recruitment and retention over many years, yet we still have not reached the point where we have the training places we need. We have not dealt with the recruitment and retention issues that existed long before I took up this role. We have a long road to go on this and it must be the number one priority for me, the Minister and everyone in healthcare in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1417">All my questions are reasonably straightforward and this one is no different. It refers to a report, Low Paid Older Workers in Ireland: a Quantitative and Qualitative profile of Low Pay among Workers Aged over 50, which makes for fairly stark reading. While they do not relate to all workers aged over 50 years, the report raises concerns. I would welcome the Minister's views on it.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2022-12-13T23:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1418">I am aware of the report on low-paid older workers in Ireland. It is useful research and I thank Dr. Micheál Collins of UCD and Dr. Catherine Elliott O'Dare of TCD for their work. It was funded by the Low Pay Commission, an independent body under the aegis of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419"> The report provides comprehensive information on both the commonalities and the differences between older and younger low-paid workers, and new insights on low-paid older workers. It is easy to think of low paid workers as younger workers who subsequently transition into better paid employment as they get older, but this study draws our attention to the fact that older workers comprise 20% of the total low-paid population. It is also worth noting that older workers are defined as those aged over 50 years and that, relative to all employees, older workers carry a lower risk of being low paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Given the anticipated growth in this demographic in the decades to come, it is important to understand its socioeconomic and labour market composition. The Government wants to improve the pay and conditions of all workers on low pay. As the Deputy will be aware, we recently agreed to move to a living wage of 60% of hourly median wages by 2026. This is the latest in a series of improvements in workers' rights over the past five years, including statutory sick pay, the protection of tips and service charges, parental leave benefit and multiple increases in the minimum wage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1421">The research was, indeed, interesting. I join the Minister in acknowledging the work of Dr. Collins and Dr. Elliott O'Dare and their teams. The specific aspects I would like to raise with the Minister concern the number of participants who believe the pay they receive is inadequate and the manner in which the living wage will seek to address this. The adequacy of pension income is a serious factor influencing older workers' choice to take up or remain in low-paid employment. A point that is interesting and valuable about the report is exactly what the Tánaiste has said: we tend to think of low-paid workers as younger workers or people doing a little bit of work, such as a weekend job, for pocket money, but it is older people who probably have an entire working life behind them who face inadequate pay in their later years. Many of them have indicated that inadequate pension income was a driver in their decision to take up or remain in low-paid employment. People reach a certain age at which they should be entitled to leave work – I believe it is 65 but the Minister believes it is older – but the people I am referring to are being forced back into the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">The objective is to eliminate low pay. There are many ways to define low pay but it is generally defined as the pay of those earning less than 66% of the median wage. With the introduction of the national living wage, the intention is to go to 60% initially and, provided the economy can manage it and businesses can afford it, to 66% thereafter. That would, at least on a statistical basis, eliminate low pay. That is what we aim to achieve. We will have auto-enrolment starting in 2024, which means people will have better pensions, although it will take a while for that to become a reality. Some of the reforms we are likely to see over the next year or two concern collective bargaining legislation, making the joint labour committees operate properly. This is because many on low pay tend to work in retail and hospitality, which are among the sectors where the joint labour committees are not functioning. There is an opportunity to make them work right and better.</p>

            <p eId="para_1423">I appreciate, as the Minister does, that older people work for a variety of reasons, but that does not mean they should not be fairly paid for the work they do. The Tánaiste announced the living wage will be benchmarked at 60% rather than 66%. I think it should be 66%. We should have a realistic and credible plan to move in that direction because that is the only way those affected will be taken out of poverty. I am glad the Tánaiste accepts low pay is not just, or mainly, a feature of the lives of younger workers. There are those who do not anticipate higher earnings later in their career. We need to move much quicker towards a living wage in consultation with businesses. It is pretty handy to say it will happen but not in the lifetime of this Government. The Minister really should be making a greater effort to move in this direction quicker.</p>

            <p eId="para_1425">The plan initially is to go to 60% by 2026 and then to 66% but that can be speeded up or slowed down depending on economic circumstances. Part of the research behind this, done by Maynooth University, indicated there is a point at which, if the minimum wage is increased too much too quickly, there can be negative effects. People could be laid off, businesses could close and people's hours could be cut back. We all want to avoid these effects, and that is why the plan is not being implemented in one fell swoop.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426"> I acknowledge that Germany has increased its minimum wage by a very large amount very quickly. It will be interesting to see how that pans out. If it pans out well, that is potentially instructive for us. If it does not, it will also be instructive for us, but we will need to examine it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1430">Digital infrastructure is one of the four dimensions of the Government's national digital strategy, which was launched in February of this year. A progress report on the cross-governmental implementation of the national digital strategy was published last week. I encourage all Deputies to consider it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431"> As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for connectivity and the national broadband plan lies with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. I agree it is clear that robust broadband infrastructure will be vital in reaching our national digital strategy targets, which will enable businesses to take advantage of digital technologies and increase sustainable employment. Just last week, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications published its digital connectivity strategy, which sets out the targets that will be achieved by the telecommunications sector in providing digital connectivity across the State. It also identifies the key enablers that will be implemented to ensure these targets are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432"> As outlined in the White Paper on Enterprise, also published last week, sustained investment in digital infrastructure, including connectivity and cybersecurity, provides the foundations for our digital economy. As we said at the launch of the White Paper, it is all about getting good jobs for people and getting those jobs and investment opportunities to all parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433"> It is clear that connectivity will be vital in achieving progress in the targets for my Department, namely 75% enterprise take-up of cloud, big data and artificial intelligence by 2030, and 90% of SMEs at a basic level of digital intensity by 2030. </p>
            <p eId="para_1434"> We now have nine regional enterprise plans in place, which will encourage collaboration among all the stakeholders to strengthen the regional offering for enterprise and therefore create an environment for successful economic growth, sustainable employment and development across the country. Digital connectivity will be a key enabler of this regional economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1435">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The reality is that the State is investing significantly in building communications infrastructure right across this country. By the middle of next year, 58% of households in Ireland will have access to a pure fibre connection but the difficulty is that we now need to exploit the investment to bring high-value jobs into every single community. This happened by default during the Covid pandemic. As we know, IDA Ireland is now redoubling efforts to bring the jobs back to the city centres rather than disperse them across provincial Ireland. What is the specific job strategy now in place to try to drive some of the FDI jobs into rural communities?</p>

One of the key targets laid out in the White Paper is that over half of new investments will be in the regions. That figure has been achieved according to IDA Ireland's 2022 figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437"> My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development are developing a national hub strategy for the period 2023 to 2025. Its purpose is to combine the various national policies and schemes into a coherent and overarching development strategy, in a single document, to leverage the national hub network, funded through the Department of Rural and Community Development, as a public asset of significance and scale. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in addition to Údarás na Gaeltachta through the development of its gteic centres, are promoting and enabling the uptake of remote working access in the regions, including their most far-flung parts. We intend to continue to support the development of hub space and the roll-out of the national broadband plan to ensure remote working is available to those who want it.</p>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, and myself are engaged with regional enterprises across the country to ensure we get the kind of development the Deputy is looking at. There is €3.5 million in planning funding for feasibility, announced for 47 projects across all regions, including counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.

            <p eId="para_1443">This is a very straightforward question. The question relates to research by Wise Business, a global fintech group, which found that 70% of SMEs in Ireland fear they may have to close in 2023 due to rising costs.

            <p eId="para_1444">It is fair to say that the Government has not been found wanting when it has come to helping businesses get through difficult periods and saving the jobs of people who work in those businesses. We demonstrated this throughout the pandemic, particularly with the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445"> I am very conscious of how worried SME owners and managers are as we go into the winter. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has had massive consequences for the whole of Europe, not just in Ireland. Indeed, we are now facing a global inflation crisis exacerbated by the war.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446"> While I have not been able to locate the Wise Business survey cited by the Deputy, I understand from media reports that it finds a large proportion of businesses fear they might have to close in 2023. On a more positive note, it finds that nearly two thirds of respondents are investing in or expanding their online presence, while more than half are planning to expand their business abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447"> My message to SMEs, professionals and farmers, is that help is now available. The temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, will provide qualifying businesses with relief on 40% of the increase in their electricity or gas bills, up to a maximum of €10,000 per month and €30,000 in some cases. It is important that businesses get their paperwork and bills in order, register and make a claim on <i>revenue.ie. </i>That is now open.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448"> As we said on budget day, the TBESS needed to be designed and receive state aid approval from the European Union, which it now has. Now that we have all the steps in place, we will shortly be able to issue payments and hope to do so before Christmas. These will be backdated to September. </p>

            <p eId="para_1449">Will the Minister give a definitive date for when the first payment will be made? I am aware that the scheme is open but people are anxious to know when they will get the payments. The survey from Wise Business covered 250 businesses. What they are reporting is worrying. Notwithstanding some positives in the survey, and while I do not wish to focus on the negative, they raise the concern that two thirds of SMEs believe there is a possibility they will have to close within the next year, while just one in three believe their business will be okay. I have never set up a business but I am married to someone who has done so. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it does not. It is tough when small business owners might be just about managing to pay their staff wages but maybe not pay wages for themselves. It is hard for people in the private sector at the moment. Many of the businesses surveyed criticised the poor banking solutions that were available and called for greater competition in the banking sector. What are the Minister's views on what his Government can do and is doing to help businesses, and specifically in the context of the issues that were raised about the need for competition in the banking sector and the issues raised about the banking sector in general?</p>

            <p eId="para_1450">On the Deputy's first question, I do not have the payment date for the first payment yet. I have spoken to the Minister for Finance about this and he indicated to me that the first payments would land in business accounts before Christmas, but I do not want to swear to that. I will follow this up with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451"> Although I have not seen the Wise Business survey itself, from the reports I have seen it is worrying. I was certainly worried when I read the headline figures from it. There are other business surveys that are less pessimistic. A recent survey from Behaviour and Attitudes with a sample size of 1,500 showed that 45% of businesses reported increased turnover in the past six months, with 18% reporting a decrease, and 61% of SMEs reporting a profit this year compared to only 53% last year. Most of the companies surveyed said they were more likely to hire staff than let staff go.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452"> On banking, the main thing we are doing is bringing in Government-backed loans, which allow businesses to borrow at lower rates and for longer periods. As the Deputy will be aware, banks are leaving Ireland, whether people like it or not. They can make more money with the same capital elsewhere. This is the reason they are leaving. Any competition would have to come from non-bank actors in the main.</p>

            <p eId="para_1453">On the expansion of the rate of payments under the TBESS, is the 40% coverage of additional costs as far as the Government can go? I have pushed the Minister of State, Deputy English, a little on this question previously. I ask this because the current difficulties being experienced by Irish businesses, particularly SMEs and family businesses, are fairly significant. They need to know there will be flexibility in the event they need to go further on it. I am seeking from the Minister an assurance that this can be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454"> There was a postponement in the increase in toll fares but that is still on the agenda. On top of the other increased costs businesses are facing, they are paying higher insurance premiums and the cost of fuel has gone up. Businesses are doing their best. I know from talking to them, and the Minister knows, that they are trying to remain agile but they do need some degree of certainty. I welcome that he said the Minister for Finance wants the first payments to be made before Christmas. That would be helpful for people who are trying to plan. The Wise survey specifically relates to their fears for next year, not this year. It would go a long way towards that if the Minister could give people a definitive date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1455">I am told that the first payments will land in business accounts within the next two weeks. I will check with the Minister for Finance tomorrow and get back to the Deputy if more information is available. At the moment, 40% is as far as we can go under EU state aid rules. In fact, we have stretched it a little. The rules say 30% but we were able to get clearance for 40%. We have done other things like reducing excise on petrol and diesel, and there are other schemes available and certainly for companies that are exporting or manufacturing. They tend to be big energy users. There are other schemes available, in some cases allowing up to €2 million to be provided to companies in the form of grants, loans, and equities. I would encourage those companies in particular to engage with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to see whether other schemes are available that would help them if the TBESS does not.</p>

            <p eId="para_1457">As a State, we have become very reliant on foreign direct investment. We have done an excellent job in attracting these companies of the last decades. Their taxation contributes dramatically to our finances, which is welcome. Enterprise Ireland also does great work in promoting Ireland's businesses and exports. In 2021, Enterprise Ireland-backed companies employed more than 200,000 people, and contributed billions of euro in exports and billions of euro to the economy as well. This is tremendous work but there is scope to scale up and support a focus on SMEs that are trading domestically. The setting up of an Irish enterprise agency would contribute greatly. That is the purpose of this question, which I have raised with the Minister of State previously.</p>

            <p eId="para_1458">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue again. I will go back over the information we have. Following the dissolution of the county enterprise boards in 2014, an enhanced national assistance enterprise model was established to be delivered by local authorities on behalf of Enterprise Ireland through the local enterprise offices, LEOs. This structure has allowed the LEOs to effectively deliver national programmes that are aligned with enterprise policy and designed and overseen by the centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland. Results from them have been immense over the past couple of years and during Covid we have certainly seen the benefits of the LEOs being able to reach a lot more companies than traditionally they would have reached. I spent the past few months visiting all the LEOs to engage with their work to see at first-hand the number of companies they were able to reach. That has been a success.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459"> The programmes they operate promote entrepreneurship, foster start-ups, and help companies to prepare and start their export journey. </p>
            <p eId="para_1460">By being embedded in the local authorities, the LEOs have been able to contribute to local economic development and to our national policy objectives. The LEOs have delivered jobs growth year on year and assisted many high-potential indigenous enterprises to transition to Enterprise Ireland, to further develop their exporting ability and to increase their potential growth. The recent extension of the LEO mandate, based on the framework developed by Enterprise Ireland, will allow the LEOs to target new exporters, while providing direct grants to firms operating in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors with more than ten employees. The LEOs also act as a first-stop shop for all businesses in signposting to Government assistance. They provide training, mentoring and consultancy programmes across a broad range of measures and some of these programmes are open to locally traded sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461"> The recently published White Paper on enterprise sets out an ambitious vision for Ireland's enterprise policy. This is to protect Ireland's strong economic position and respond to challenges and opportunities that have emerged as a result of: the pandemic; wider economic and geopolitical developments; digitalisation; and an increased urgency to decarbonise our industries. The White Paper also sets out that the LEOs will continue to enhance their advisory services for locally trading firms and productivity, particularly digitalisation and reducing the energy and carbon emissions. This will help enable Irish-based enterprise to succeed through our competitive advantage founded on sustainability, innovation and productivity, delivering rewarding jobs and livelihoods throughout the country. It is time we worked with the system that is there. It is doing a good job, and the White Paper is going to try to push that system as far as we can in order to reach those extra companies and drive the ambition we have for increased exports.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">There is no doubt that the 31 LEOs have done good work to date. In 2021, for instance, they contributed to the creation of 7,400 new jobs. They have supported small businesses through the provision of grants and assisted entrepreneurs in starting businesses. However, we have an opportunity to build on their knowledge and the knowledge of others to create an even more ambitious State body that is focused solely on indigenous business. An Irish enterprise agency could support established retailers on our main streets and help regenerate our town centres. This would support and enhance small businesses and help start-ups. Our reliance on multinational companies that are mostly based in urban areas has contributed to a growing regional imbalance in the economy. An Irish enterprise agency could help in addressing this imbalance. These SMEs, including coffee shops, small fashion stores or retail units, are often the engine of the domestic local economy. There needs to be an agency advocating for them and supporting them in growing the indigenous enterprise sector in a more focused and organised way. Such an agency could be the one-stop shop for both start-ups and established domestic businesses, providing advice and financial support to the indigenous SME sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1463">We have discussed some of the issues the Deputy has raised previously. We certainly discussed them at the SME task force that the Tánaiste set up over two years ago to focus and see if we need another agency or if we can reach the companies we want to reach through our existing structures. Our best estimate is that it is best to use the structures we have that have worked extremely well, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs that are reaching all those companies. We must try to use those structures to reach an even greater number of companies. We can do that. The framework announced by the Tánaiste recently and the White Paper set out the ambition to reach more companies and increase the number of companies exporting by over 2,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464"> We have the structures in place. There is no need for another agency because there will be a cost with that, including planning, setting up and legislation. That might just complicate matters. We can strengthen our offering and reach those companies we have been reaching and dealing with in recent years through the Covid supports administered by the LEOs, the local authorities and our agencies. We are doing quite well on that. I am open to seeing where the Deputy thinks the gaps are. We think we have the structures in place and that the changes have been made to reach those gaps and to work with companies that have an ambition to export. The Deputy is right in that we want to encourage more companies to come forward to avail of the offerings and supports there are and to avail of the reach of new markets. We call out the benefits of the locally traded sector in the White Paper and there is a desire to do exactly as the Deputy has suggested; to better support them. We can probably best do that through digitalisation, the green agenda, the micro green programmes and a number of initiatives that are already on offer to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1465">I agree with an awful lot of what the Minister of State said, but we need to establish an Irish enterprise agency for a number of reasons. The Minister of State will agree that our over-reliance on a number of major international corporations is a risk to the State going forward, with ten companies paying a significant proportion of corporation tax. Any changes to this, which would be well out of our control, could put grave stress on our public finances. While it is imperative that we continue to attract foreign direct investment and to achieve export growth, it is equally important that we grow our indigenous sectors to provide balance in our economy and additional security for our public finances. Transforming the LEOs into a larger and more ambitious agency can deliver strong benefits to domestic businesses, workers and the State. That is why I raised this matter previously with the Minister of State. It is an idea we need to look at and we need to do a bit more than what the Minister of State spoke about. We need a stronger and more specific focus on SMEs and small companies. There is great potential for growth in the SME sector in the coming years. We need to protect that and a focused organisation would do that. Some LEOs are excellent but others are not so excellent, to put it mildly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1466">It is important that we use the centre-of-excellence approach, which shares the data across the various LEOs and is able to compare them. There is that advice and guidance through the LEOs as well. Having visited all the LEOs, I saw the great work they are doing at first hand. While each LEO administers the national schemes and the schemes we have all agreed, they have their own version of the schemes as well and can tweak them slightly. It is important to do that. There is a lot of opportunity to learn across the LEO network and to drive innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467"> The new framework that has been launched and agreed with Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs initially allows the LEOs to service companies that have up to 50 employees. We can build on that. That is the opportunity to reach those companies about which the Deputy is concerned. We all want to see how we can reach and support more companies, how we can help create more jobs in our regions and how we can do that best. We can do that best through the structures that are there because we can use our time, efforts and resources to champion that as opposed to spending a long number of years redesigning something else that might not provide anything better. What is key to me is that we continually devise new support mechanisms and schemes and administer them through the network we have already. That is my sense of it, and the White Paper has given us a lot to think about. We believe we have made the right call, but we are open to teasing out this matter. If there are any gaps, we want to close them.</p>

My Department is already focused on improving the service, with initiatives such as: the trusted partner registration system; the introduction of the electronic employment permit; and the multisite general employment permit for doctors. Waiting times for employment permit processing have been greatly reduced this year. They are now taking approximately three to eight business days to process, which is well down from where it was in January, when it was taking four or five months. A major change has happened there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472"> Ireland has a clear division between economic migration and general immigration policies. A recipient of an employment permit undergoes a separate application process with the Department of Justice for a visa to enter the State if they are a citizen of a visa-required country. Over 60 non-European Economic Area countries, such as the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, are not in the visa-required category so their citizens do not have to apply for an entry visa from the Department of Justice after they get an employment permit from our Department. In time, we would like to see the development of a single application procedure for work permits and entry visas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473"> My Department and the Department of Justice are currently establishing an interdepartmental group to examine the legal and operational changes required to deliver a more seamless customer experience for users of the employment permit and entry visa systems. It is expected that recommendations from this group could be made to Government within the next six months. As part of that working arrangement, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice, our officials and I had a working session to tease through the options we have in front of us on this to try to align our systems. This would ensure we would be in a position to deliver a faster and more efficient service to those who are applying for visas and permits. My Department is building a new employment permits IT system that will take advantage of the latest technologies to deliver a fast and efficient service. We will ensure that the new system is developed in tandem with the Department of Justice in order that both systems can deliver a more seamless service into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1474">I thank the Minister of State for the work he has done in this area and for improving the service dramatically. We had a huge problem with junior doctors coming in. It has been agreed that 1,000 permits will be issued as general employment permits for those who want to come in as home care workers. How will that be fast-tracked? There is a huge shortage of home care workers. We need to make sure we have the appropriate criteria and training for those who come in.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475"> The second part to that question is as follows. If you have people here who are on stamp 2 visas already, will they be entitled to apply for one of those permits?</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">If a person has an employer who is prepared to employ them, are they entitled to apply for a permit even though they are already here in Ireland from outside the EU under a stamp 2 visa? </p>

            <p eId="para_1477">To answer the question in reverse, my understanding is that the answer is "Yes". While every case is slightly different, generally once somebody is legally permitted to be in this State, they can apply for a work permit. I can deal with the Deputy on specific cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478"> Regarding home care assistants, thankfully, we have made some progress on this. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and I, and our Departments, came together with a working arrangement since last March to do some research in this area and engage all the stakeholders and providers of these services to see how we could best respond to a shortage of available talent to work in the home to provide care. The report contained 16 recommendations. If we implement all these recommendations, in the long run, they will be able to deal with a shortage of talent locally through training, initiatives, campaigns and marketing. In the short term, there was a recommendation that our Department would sanction home care assistants and take them off the ineligible occupation list. The ask was for 1,000 permits to be facilitated and that is something we have agreed to fast track. I hope to be able to make an announcement on that in the next couple of days because it is an important area. I know the Deputy has raised this issue a lot as it is something he is anxious about so I am glad it is finally moving in the right direction. </p>

            <p eId="para_1479">Regarding the amalgamation of both application processes, the Minister of State is saying it will take six months. Going back to the original question, which is about the amalgamation of the permit application and the visa application, does the Minister of State believe we can have one system in place? I know this will take some time between the Departments to work out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480"> Farmers are another group that have a huge shortage of available workforce. What are the criteria for issuing permits for people who want to come in and work on farms? What number are we talking about in that case? </p>

            <p eId="para_1481">The aim is that within the next six months the working group involving both Departments will bring forward some suggestions about how we can align our systems. We will set out a plan for establishing a single application procedure to cover employment permits and entry visas. It is about how we can align our systems. We managed to fast track and fix the delays in our Department by increasing the number of staff available, changing some of the IT systems and putting long-term changes in place. The Department of Justice is also making changes in respect of staff and trying to match up with us in our decisions so that is one area where we can improve the timelines. Over the next six months, we will look at different mechanisms and systems whereby we can align the application procedures and try to get to a one-stage process if we can. I can report back to the Deputy as that work is carried out over the months ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482"> In respect of the other category, similar to the home care assistants, we have been focusing over the past couple of months on three main categories. One would be around dairy farm assistants, bus drivers and home care assistants. We did make changes for farmers last year in the last review and, hopefully, I will be in a position to inform of changes in the next couple of days. There is an ask based on research for quite a high number of permits to be facilitated for dairy farm assistants and I hope to be able to inform the Deputy of good news in that regard in the next couple of days. </p>

            <p eId="para_1485">Violence and harassment in the workplace are unacceptable and undermine the principles of human rights. We have comprehensive legislation in Ireland to protect against this and the International Labour Organization, ILO, convention sends a clear signal to workers and employers that every workplace must be free from harassment and violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486"> I was committed to Ireland being an early ratifier of this convention. I am particularly pleased that we have met the timeline to ratify this convention before the end of 2022 in line with the Minister for Justice's new zero-tolerance action plan on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. </p>
            <p eId="para_1487"> Since the Government approved its ratification on 29 November 2022, my Department has engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the ILO to arrange the signing of the instrument of ratification by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the depositing of the treaty with the ILO in Geneva. We expect to complete the process by the end of 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488"> The ILO is unique in the UN system with governments, workers and employers working together to promote decent work and advance social justice. I thank IBEC and ICTU for their work on this. The strong relationship we have with employer and employee representative bodies is fundamental to our ability to play an active role within the ILO.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489"> The world of work has altered so much since 1923 when Ireland, as a new State, joined the ILO, its first international organisation. I am pleased that Ireland, through ratification of this ILO Convention, is taking a strong stand against violence and harassment in the workplace.</p>

            <p eId="para_1490">The Tánaiste's response is very welcome, particularly as it is in tandem with the implementation of the third strategy under the Department of Justice. I know the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment conducted a stakeholder consultation on it. I am interested in the tenor of some of the responses that came back and the extent to which they highlighted gender harassment and sexual harassment within the workplace. It is quite striking that the convention leads so strongly with gender-based violence and harassment disproportionately affecting women and girls and how difficult that can make working life for them. We have heard from victims of sexual harassment that when it happens in the workplace, it is so often a surprise and it is so often that the victim simply freezes and cannot believe it has happened in what should be a safe space - the place they go to work. Women in particular face a spectrum of sexual harassment but for that to occur in the workplace where they must go every day, albeit sometimes remotely now, makes life extremely difficult.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">The convention is a legal instrument that recognises the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment as well. It acknowledges that gender-based violence and harassment disproportionately affects women and girls. The convention calls for states to recognise and address this as far as is possible and to minimise the effect of domestic violence and harassment at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492"> The introduction of domestic violence leave by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth goes beyond what is required by the convention and does represent tangible action by the Government in this regard. Ratification of the convention is listed as a deliverable in the implementation plan for the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Other actions in that strategy provide an excellent response to C190's requirements in respect of victims of gender-based violence and harassment in the world of work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1493">The timing of this is wonderful because the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality, in which the Tánaiste participated at an earlier stage, will publish its report on Thursday, 15 December on ending gender stereotyping, in particular, in Ireland. So much of this, as the convention recognises, comes from what has been an unequal gender-based power relationship for many years. I would suggest that the Department could lean into the Department of Education in respect of its programme on relationships and sex education, which is really the only way to effect long-term inter-generational change - a cultural change - of the kind that is necessary to disrupt those unequal power relationships, which form the basis for so much of gender and other harassment but particularly gender harassment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1494">We will certainly do that. We are keen to work across Government and different Departments to get this right and make some real changes in these areas. One of the things I have been pleased to be involved in in the past number of years is increasing the number of women on State boards and company boards. We have made real progress in that regard. It is more or less 50:50 or 45:55 on State boards and well over 30% on the boards of listed companies. Where it is still pretty weak is at the C suite - CEO, CFO and CPO. Boards are much better while leadership positions are really not great. These things will only fundamentally change in the workplace if there is an equal number of women in those senior positions in the first place. That is not to say men cannot be harassed by women but it is much less likely to occur. Again, it is something that is very much on the agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I have discussed on a few occasions with his colleague, Deputy Bríd Smith. As Deputy Paul Murphy is aware, we have difficulties with the Bill. We put that on the record on the first night in the convention centre when we discussed it. During the Second Stage debate on the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill, I outlined the Department's difficulties and concerns with the Bill, as drafted, and why it could not be supported by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499"> If a person is in receipt of an occupational pension, his or her relationship is with the trustees of the pension fund. The person no longer has an employment relationship with his or her former employer. As the Deputy will be aware, trustees have statutory and fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of all members of a fund. It is the responsibility of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to act as an independent and impartial means of resolving complaints alleging financial loss occasioned by an act of maladministration and disputes of fact or law in respect of occupational pension schemes and personal retirement savings accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500"> It is important to note that access to the industrial relations machinery of the State, which is what the Bill seeks, including access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is governed by section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990. This legislation provides that a worker means any person aged 15 years or over who has entered or works under a contract with an employer. A person in receipt of an occupational pension is not a worker and therefore cannot have a complaint dealt with by the Workplace Relations Commission. In March of this year, my Department launched a public consultation on the issue of retired workers' access to industrial relations and the submissions received are available to work through.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501"> The reason for the long delay is that 18 months ago I committed to Deputy Bríd Smith, as the sponsor of the Bill, that while I did not think the proposed legislation could address the issue or that it was the right place to do it, we had simply tried to find a solution to give greater access. I met some of the groups involved in devising the legislation with the Deputy and committed to doing a public consultation to see if we could find a way to do this. We are not convinced that the Bill is the answer. I have been honest about that from day one. I am still not convinced. The public consultation is in place, and there have been submissions. It is open to Deputy Paul Murphy to work through them and to see if he wants to make changes to the legislation before he brings it to Committee Stage or to see if we could bring forward other solutions. For our part, we have consulted with other Departments to get their views on the submissions in order to see if we can assist in some way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1502">There have been campaigns for years by groups that represent more than 500,000 retired workers. It is 18 months since the Bill passed Second Stage in the House, but the Minister of State is just saying that we will have a consultation. Does he accept it is a problem that six months after a person who has paid into an occupational pension scheme for all his or her working life retires, that person has no say in any proposed changes, has no access to an effective mechanism to air issues or seek redress and that, in effect, his or her pension can be raided? It can be negotiated away, and the retired person has no input whatsoever. The person has no right to be consulted before any of those changes are made. One's income can be slashed. Does the Minister of State accept there is a problem in this regard that needs to be addressed? If he does not think our Bill is the way to do it, what is he going to do? Having a consultation is just kicking the can down the road at this point. If he had said this 18 months ago, that would be fine. A year and a half has passed, however, and it is not even clear if the Minister of State accepts that there is a fundamental issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">-----or maybe it was the case that he came in with preprepared ideas in the context of what he was going to say. I very clearly said that following on from the commitment given to his colleague on the floor of the convention centre, we would explore the issue to see if we could help. We fundamentally disagree with the Bill because it would change the relationship of industrial relations discussions and negotiations and bring in a third party that is not still working for an employer. We disagree on that, and it will not change because, to be honest, I cannot see how we could facilitate it. I informed the Deputy's colleague that I would engage with her. On foot of the Bill and the arguments she made in respect of it, we met some of the groups involved and we said we would have a public consultation. That is now over, and the submissions have come in. They are available to Deputy Paul Murphy and to anybody else to look at and to tease through.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506"> We have engaged with other Departments, which are also looking at those submissions to see if any change could be made to strengthen the position of retirees and pensioners. It might not be for my Department to take the lead because it does not fall to us to do this. While I understand what is required to be addressed, we might not be able to solve it within the Department and we might have to work with other Departments as well. In the context of any changes to pension benefits payable from a scheme, the trustees of that scheme are required to notify members, beneficiaries and authorised trade unions. Changes made to the occupational pension scheme regulations 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members of these situations. That gives them the opportunity to have their say at that stage but I understand from the groups that they do not feel that is enough. I am sorry, but this is a complicated matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1507">I heard exactly what the Minister of State said earlier. He just repeated it. The essence of it is that the Department is going to explore the matter to see if we can help. That is great. Some 18 months after this was brought very firmly to his attention, the Minister of State has indicated that the Department must see if there is anything it can do. The Minister of State indicated that the consultation process has taken place. Does he accept that there is a fundamental problem here, and that it is fundamentally unjust that workers have had their pension schemes raided, both by the Government and by private sector employers and that deals done have had profound impacts on retired workers at a vulnerable stage of their lives, on which they had no prior consultation and no ability to impact? Does he accept that that is a fundamental problem?</p>
            <p eId="para_1508"> The Minister of State makes the point that, as the law stands, retired workers cannot go to the WRC, but we get to make the law in this place. It is not a defence to use the phrase "as the law stands". That is precisely the point of amending the law, to say that retired workers should have access. Pensions are deferred wages and retired workers should have access to the industrial relations machinery in terms of being able to go to the WRC. It does not affect other industrial relations machinery; it simply says that they should have a voice in any proposed change that impacts on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1511">Nobody is blocking the Deputy from doing so. He is totally free to argue his case and bring the Bill through the system. What the Government is stating is that it does not agree with the Bill. We think it is a flawed Bill that will not solve the problem the Deputy wants to solve. It will also complicate the industrial relations machinery we have that operates extremely well because it brings in people who have left the workforce to have a say on existing situations within the workforce. We do not believe that will help.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512"> In regard to the law, the role of the pensions ombudsman already exists in Part XI of the Pensions Act to act as an independent and impartial means of resolving complaints alleging financial loss occasioned by an act of maladministration and disputes of fact or law in respect of occupational pension schemes and personal retirement saving schemes. There is legislation in place. We are not the line Department in respect of that legislation. When I met the groups, I understood that their particular concern is that they feel they are left out and not consulted at various stages. My interpretation of the law is that they are consulted, but they feel they cannot put an agenda on it; they are consulted but they are not listened to. It may be possible to strengthen the legislation but Deputy Paul Murphy's Bill is not the answer.

            <p eId="para_1515">The Government has set out a target of having 50% of jobs outside Dublin. While it is achieving that, the difficulty is that the vast majority of jobs are still located in cities and that the provincial towns are losing out, in particular on foreign direct investment. What are we going to do to address that?</p>

            <p eId="para_1516">There are a couple of questions in this space, so the answers are pretty similar. I know the Deputy has already had a discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, but I will try to add to that. Delivering balanced regional growth and job creation is a core objective of this Government and the Deputy is aware that it is something we are committed to. We want to try to help as best we possibly can. It is a key component in the recently published White Paper on Enterprise 2022-2030, which sets out enterprise policy and high-end thinking for the next five or six years out to 2030 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517"> The White Paper emphasises the role my Department and its agencies continue to play in achieving this objective through direct assistance to businesses as well as promotion and enhancement of the regional enterprise ecosystem to encourage businesses to invest and create jobs. For example, it includes a target of unemployment not exceeding one percentage point of the national unemployment rate in any region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518"> Enterprise Ireland has a continued focus on supporting enterprise in all regions to adapt to a challenging market environment, and on maximising job retention and creation. Enterprise Ireland's strategy has set targets of creating 45,000 new jobs by 2024 and that over two thirds of new jobs will be created outside Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">Regional development is at the centre of IDA Ireland's strategy. IDA Ireland is also committed to more balanced compact regional development and will target half of all its investments from 2021 to 2024 to regional locations. The results out this week will show success in achieving that regional balance, albeit not into every town and village that you would ask, but there is regional balance. Local enterprise offices are a key part of achieving what we all want to achieve. At the heart of this is development and entrepreneurship in our towns and communities throughout the country. The LEOs will continue to enhance their advisory services with locally trading firms to improve productivity particularly around digitisation and reducing energy and carbon emissions, as well as supports. The key strategy by which we can make progress is on the regional enterprise plans. We are now into their third iteration. Deputy Naughten is involved with counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon. Thankfully there are nine regional plans in place. They are locally driven by local entrepreneurs involved with the State agencies locally across all the education, social protection, Enterprise Ireland, EI, LEOs, local authorities and so on. They are in charge of bringing forward their own plans. Money has been secured to drive those ideas and concepts such as hubs or other situations also in the sum of €145 million to drive that agenda. I am happy to work with Deputy Naughten on some initiatives, as the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, also said to bring forward job opportunities in his town. </p>

            <p eId="para_1520">In Project Ireland 2040, we set out a hub and spoke strategy. Athlone was one of the towns designated for growth to become a potential new city and to help attract IDA Ireland and foreign direct investment, FDI, jobs into the region. That is happening successfully in Athlone, which is fast becoming the silicon heartland. It now has more tech jobs <i>per capita</i> than anywhere in northern Europe. However the difficulty is that the other towns in the area, namely, Longford, Roscommon, Ballinasloe, Mullingar and Tullamore are not benefiting. The spoke is not working. What are we doing to deliver on that objective?</p>

            <p eId="para_1521">I was involved in setting up the growth centres. Athlone was a regional one, Sligo was another. We know our cities, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin and Cork are already thriving. In the growth centres of Athlone, Dundalk, Drogheda and Sligo, we try to target the infrastructure in order that those areas are ready to create jobs and can win jobs. We have seen the success of that in Athlone, as I have said. Stage 2 is that the region then benefits from that success and when companies make second-stage or third-stage investment, they often look beyond that regional centre they are in and pick the next one. When we sit down with IDA Ireland clients, we cannot drag them into an area, we must attract them through all the mechanisms that are there, to push them into a region. They then get familiar with a region and make decisions beyond that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522"> What is more important in the other towns Deputy Naughten referenced is that locally grown Irish companies must be the best chance that we can win here and we want to support them. I believe the regional enterprise plans are a key area to identify what works for each individual town and village into which you want to drive jobs. You have to put in place the ecosystem to make it happen, the supports and the opportunity to invest in buildings or hubs and all that infrastructure. However there has to be some suggestions locally as to how to make that happen. That includes the key sites, which the Deputy flagged before in his area, that could be looked at to develop into enterprise facilities as well. That is what the €145 million can make happen over the next two or three years if the right ideas come forward. </p>

            <p eId="para_1523">I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that because as I have said to the Tánaiste over the past two years, 15 minutes up the road from Athlone is the town of Ballinasloe. As we know there is a limited ability to expand or bring a large investment into Athlone either on the Roscommon side or the Westmeath side because the industrial lands are not there. There is a 50-acre land bank available in the town of Ballinasloe that is in public ownership. IDA Ireland has point-blank refused to acquire those lands where the infrastructure is in place. The water, wastewater and fibre optic cable, all the infrastructure, is there and yet IDA Ireland has refused to acquire those additional lands and to market that particular campus to investors in the midland region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1524">I recently met many residents and business owners in Ballinasloe with some of the Deputy's colleagues and with Senator Dolan to do just that, namely, to focus on what we can do for that particular town. IDA Ireland owns other land in Ballinasloe and surrounding areas that is being marketed with some success over the years. In regard to that 50-acre site, I am quite interested in it. We looked at it before with a view to housing and so on. That, to me, is a perfect site that could be developed under the regional enterprise plan in conjunction with the local authorities putting that forward as a key action to grow an enterprise unit or enterprise centre and the opportunity to create jobs and the blend with education and skills. I do not think IDA Ireland has to be involved on that site at all. It has other land that it should prioritise but that is an opportunity. I agree with the Deputy that there is infrastructure in place. It is a perfect site, looked at through the eyes of the local authority with which the Deputy should work and bring forward a plan. There are mechanisms and funding opportunities in the regional enterprise plan to fund something like that and certainly to kick it off. There is a perfect opportunity to have an enterprise and education combination on that site to create local jobs and give an opportunity to Irish entrepreneurs who need access to a property solution in that area and to bring them back to create jobs in their own county. They are well capable of doing it with the right co-ordination.</p>

            <p eId="para_1527">I thank Deputy Flaherty for raising this. As he acknowledged, the Tánaiste was able to announce very strong annual results for IDA Ireland in 2022 yesterday which showed a substantial increase in growth in FDI employment on the 2021 figures. The growth in employment in 2022 brought the number of people employed in the FDI sector in Ireland to more than 300,000, which is the highest FDI employment level ever. The results showed continued substantial growth in FDI over 2022 despite the difficult global economic environment with 33,000 new jobs created. Job losses, which were at historically low levels in recent years, increased in the latter half of 2022 as some tech companies sought to reduce costs and employee numbers in line with reduced revenue forecasts and weakening company valuations. These lay-offs, proportionate to the size of the overall portfolio, resulted in less net employment growth this year giving a net increase of just above 24,000 jobs year on year. The strongest regional performance among IDA Ireland clients in 2022 was in the mid-east region, which saw a net change of 13.6% followed by Dublin at 10.8% and the Deputy's own region in the midlands of 9.7%, which he has just acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528"> In addition to the high-level results announced yesterday a more detailed analytical report with results split by ownership, region, by county and sector will follow next month. In regard to the most recent figures I have available, I can advise that in 2021, there were 13,010 IDA Ireland-supported jobs in Longford, of which 186 were new jobs. Enterprise Ireland is currently surveying its clients to collect employment data so it is not yet possible to give employment gains for 2022. However the 2021 figures were that there were 2,262 EI-supported jobs in Longford. In January 2023, we will have the employment survey from EI which will update us with the 2022 figures. </p>
            <p eId="para_1529"> In regard to the property issue raised by Deputy Flaherty, IDA Ireland has prioritised Longford for development in its 2021 to 2024 property programme. I plan to deliver advanced building solutions in that period within Longford town. As the Deputy said we had a successful visit recently. I commend the team behind the co:worx hub space in Edgeworthstown. I recommend that Deputy Naughten call into it on his way home some day to see what can be done with a very successful hub. </p>

He saw first-hand the excellent work that is under way at Lir Analytical, where Michael Savage and the team are leading in the area of biosecurity in animal feed production and healthcare. The one deficiency that was pointed out related to a site for an advanced factory and also for Enterprise Ireland-supported and LEO-supported businesses. This is critically important. The Minister of State's colleague alluded to the regional enterprise plans and how local councils can use them to identify and develop sites. We have a see-saw situation whereby IDA Ireland is saying that there needs to be an onus on the local authority to drive this and the local authorities are sitting back and saying that IDA Ireland needs to come and provide advanced building solutions. Much like the rest of the country, we cannot wait. We need to see something happen in respect of this matter. I need to see what the Department can do to impress on the council the need to move forward with this.</p>

The Deputy and I had the pleasure of joining the midlands regional enterprise oversight group, which is chaired by Dr. Anne Cusack, along with programme manager Sarah Morgan. There was massive energy in the room where we met, with massive commitment from both the agencies and the various educational institutions. Given that some of the objectives in the plan involve capitalising on the existing strengths of the midlands in respect of smart specialisation, we will definitely be able to work with the local authority and its excellent chief executive, Paddy Mahon, on those building solutions. As the Deputy said, it cannot always fall on IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland to provide that. If Longford County Council is willing to step forward, as I absolutely know it is, we will certainly find a way to work with it.</p>

We have an excellent case study in Longford in a triangle on the Ballinalee Road between Abbott Ireland, Avery Dennison and Technimark. We have in the region of 2,500 jobs in IDA Ireland-assisted and supported companies. That is a real template for how regional development and job creation can be a success. I am delighted to hear that the Minister of State will put his strength and knowledge behind efforts by Longford County Council to identify and secure that land. It is good to know the money is there in terms of the regional growth plans. We need to put the emphasis and responsibility very much on the local authority. It needs to be a tandem arrangement between it and IDA Ireland. The Minister of State will have seen from his visits to Longford that we have exhausted any land that is there and urgently need to identify new land. There is a significant onus on the county council to drive this and drive the next generation of job creation in the county.</p>

            <p eId="para_1537">We want to reward work and ensure that work pays more. Minimum wage workers are among the hardest working people in Ireland and deserve to paid appropriately, particularly at a time of rising prices. In September, the Government agreed to accept the Low Pay Commission’s recommendation to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to €11.30 from 1 January 2023. At least 164,000 people will benefit, but with think many hundreds of thousands more will benefit too, because of the knock-on increases that those on slightly higher pay will get. It works out at roughly €30 per week, €120 a month or €1,664 a year for a person in full-time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538"> Ireland has a well-established system for setting the minimum wage based on the Low Pay Commission and it is a system that works well. As the Deputy is aware, I want to move from a national minimum wage to a national living wage. Following Government approval in November, I announced the introduction of a national living wage for employees. This will be benchmarked at 60% of hourly median wages in line with the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. It will be phased in over a four-year period running to 2026. The new agreed national minimum wage of €11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023 is in line with this transition and therefore next year can be considered the first year of a proposed four-year path towards reaching a living wage of 60% of median wages. The introduction of the living wage is the latest in a series of improvements to workers' rights over the last five years, including statutory sick pay, protection of tips and service charges and a new public holiday and the work-life balance legislation currently going through the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_1539">I congratulate the Tánaiste on his period in the office he is holding at the moment and on the substantial increases he has made to the rights and conditions of workers. We have all been informed so much by Covid and the opportunities to work differently and in better ways. This is a really significant part of that. As the Tánaiste says, it is essential that work does pay and that we are incentivising work at every turn for everybody in the labour market, irrespective of what they are earning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540"> I visited Dublin Chamber recently. We have unemployment at historically low figures, but the single biggest issue for them is labour market shortages and trying to encourage more people to work in this market. I also spoke with representatives the Family Business Network in Kilkenny. They informed me that approximately 173,000 businesses employ more than 1 million people in the State, which is more than the State and foreign businesses put together. They are uniquely focused on the cost of jobs and the cost of creating jobs. I might come back to that issue in a supplementary question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1541">I thank the Deputy for her remarks. I hope that in times to come people will look back on this Government as one that has made a lot of strides forward in improving terms and conditions for workers. At a time when employers find it hard to recruit and retain staff, I believe that better terms and conditions and better pay must be part of the solution. We are moving towards a living wage. Auto-enrolment, which has been spoken about for a very long time, will become a reality in 2024. People in the private sector in particular will now have an occupational pension to top up their State pension in the way those in the public sector and the big companies do. Sick pay is a reality from 1 January. There is a new public holiday in February and the legislation that is being brought through on work-life balance and remote working is a good step forward, too. This builds on reforms like paternity benefit, enhanced maternity benefit, and the restoration of treatment benefit which we have seen in previous years. It is all about making work pay and rewarding people for the work they do, which we believe will help to build a better society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1542">I thank the Tánaiste. A key part of that better society is continued low unemployment, continued employment opportunities and the opportunity to derive Exchequer returns from PAYE and people paying tax. One of the key parts around incentivising people into the labour market and addressing the cost of creating jobs is looking at taxation. I would reject any attempt to increase employer's PRSI by any political party in this House. We should look at measures around temporary reductions in PRSI if that were suitable, to support businesses as they try to continue to create jobs to support the Irish economy and people in it. We should also look again at the marginal rates of personal taxation. The OECD said recently that high marginal rates of personal taxation may continue to constrain entrepreneurship as well as attracting entrepreneurial labour from abroad. We have very high personal tax rates and marginal tax rates relative to other jurisdictions. The Family Business Network, whose members employ so many people in this State and who contribute €19 billion to the Exchequer has asked that we look again at marginal tax rates and try to push out the point at which people hit the marginal rate to €50,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_1543">I thank the Deputy. I think the fact that people pay the highest marginal tax rate at such modest incomes is very unfair. That improves next year when people will be able to earn up to €40,000 without paying that highest rate of income tax and will only pay the highest rate on income earned above €40,000. If we look across the OECD and across Europe, Irish workers pay much the same amount of income tax as other workers do but the distribution is different. People on relatively modest incomes pay the highest rate and that is very unfair. One would have to earn £120,000 in Britain before paying the highest rate of 45% there. Somebody on €40,000 would pay that here. I know it is not an exact comparison but I think the House will get the point. We want to increase that threshold. Like the Deputy, I would be reluctant to increase employer's PRSI but there are circumstances under which we would consider it, particularly if it meant the introduction of new benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">One of the things the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is working on at the moment is the possibility of pay-related benefits, which may include things like subsidised childcare and healthcare. I would not like to see it happen unless it was linked to real benefits for workers and even benefits for employers as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1546">This question is about the corporate sustainability due diligence directive. It is potentially very important European legislation that would make corporations responsible for human rights abuses, labour rights abuses, environmental abuses and consumer rights abuses throughout their supply chain. Unfortunately, it is being subject to intense lobbying by big corporations to try to water it down and make it ineffective. Most recently, they have succeeded in a serious watering-down of the negotiating position of the European Council in the form of the partial exclusion of the financial sector, which means its effective exclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1547">I thank the Deputy. As he knows, Ireland has been supportive of the objective of the proposed directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, which will play a significant role in promoting responsible business conduct. This is a complex proposal with far-reaching implications for companies and stakeholders concerning the prevention of adverse human rights and environment impacts. An EU-wide framework is best-placed to both support the functioning of the Single Market and influence respect for human rights and the environment beyond the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548"> While I welcome the progress made and the speed at which this has been accomplished, I had greater ambition for the proposal in a number of areas, including favouring a value chain-based approach, in recognition of the fact adverse human rights and environmental impacts can occur throughout the value chain, and a greater focus within the directive on the gender aspects of the proposal, as women can suffer more disproportionately from the consequences of adverse impacts. I raised these at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 1 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549"> On the Deputy's specific query, a particular issue arose in the final text that came before Council proposing discretion be provided to member states regarding the directive's applicability to the financial sector. Ireland considers that it should apply to relevant companies across all sectors of the economy, including regulated financial undertakings. Furthermore, Ireland wants a harmonised approach on this issue to ensure policy coherence and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the general market. Accordingly, Ireland did not support the adoption of a general approach on the proposal. However, a general approach is now being adopted and the process now moves to the trilogue negotiations between the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550"> I understand a final directive may not emerge until the latter part of 2023 following the conclusion of the trilogue process. Therefore, it is still premature to focus on implementation of the proposal, including any policy choices that might arise for member states, in advance of the Parliament's trilogue with the Council and Commission, during which further debate will no doubt be had on such matters. I assure the Deputy I will be keeping a close eye on the trilogue process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">I thank the Minister of State. It is good to hear the Government opposed the watering-down that happened at the latest European Council meeting. Reuters reported that at an earlier stage in the negotiations the Government indicated it wanted to exclude asset managers and institutional investors from the scope and that it said in a submission it could not signal its agreement to including financial undertakings. Was that accurate?</p>
            <p eId="para_1552"> Oxfam's lead on this has commented about the effective exclusion of the financial sector, in that whether to include that sector is left up to the member states. The consequence will be the financial sector can continue to bankroll human rights violations and damage to the planet without being held accountable as it remains up to each European country to decide whether it wants to make banks and other financial player clean up business. We could have huge investment in fossil fuels by private investors, the destruction of indigenous peoples' living conditions and environment and these private entities can now be excluded by member states.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">Again, we do not support the overall adoption and we raised concerns about the financial sector. There was an issue during the early stages of the negotiation that there were different treatments in this directive from other directives. We wanted to support consistency in various directives around that. We also had concern about the inclusion within the scope of national social security schemes and institutions for occupational retirement provisions. Those concerns were superseded by our overall concerns about the ability of member states to exclude financial institutions, as highlighted by the remarks from Oxfam.</p>

            <p eId="para_1554">I hope the Parliament will adopt a strong position and in trilogue this will be strengthened again and the financial sector will be brought back in. If not, that creates a danger, as the Minister of State himself pointed out, of a patchwork of different regulations in different countries. That is against the whole purpose of the EU and also creates pressure for a race to the bottom because investors may locate in countries where they are not going to be held responsible for what is happening lower down the value chain. Let us say that does not happen and the Council's position on the financial sector is what is ultimately adopted. In that case, will the Government give a commitment it will include the financial sector and that it will not take the option that may be open to it of not including the sector? Ireland could create a good example by saying it is going for a high level of responsibility and that finance will be included in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1560">I am very conscious business owners and managers are worried heading into the new year. The invasion of Ukraine has had massive consequences for the whole of Europe and not just Ireland. Indeed, we are now facing a global inflation crisis exacerbated by the war. Energy and other input costs have risen considerably. Interest rates are rising and consumer confidence is waning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561"> It is fair to say the Government has not been found wanting when it has come to helping businesses get through difficult periods and saving the jobs of the people who work there. That was particularly evident with the employment wage subsidy scheme during the pandemic. My message to small and medium-sized enterprises, professionals and farmers is help is available. The temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, will provide qualifying businesses with relief on 40% of the increase in their electricity or gas bills up to a maximum of €10,000 per month and €30,000 in some cases. It is important businesses get their paperwork and bills in order, register and make a claim on <i>revenue.ie.</i></p>
            <p eId="para_1562"> Along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I launched the Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme for manufacturing and internationally-traded firms in October. It is assisting firms suffering liquidity problems and those impacted by severe rises in energy costs. I anticipate further modifications to the scheme will be announced shortly. We are also complementing financial grants with State-backed, low-cost loans. The State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will be open within weeks and will assist the wider business sector with liquidity, investment in energy efficiency and working capital for the next few months and years. Furthermore, a new State-backed growth and sustainability loan scheme will open for applications early next year. This is a successor to the popular future growth loan scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563"> In the medium to long term, we will help businesses invest in energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. There are about 20 energy efficiency schemes already available but take-up is not what it should be. That is perhaps because people do not know about them or may not perceive a return on investment. We will work to ensure the right incentives and information are in place to improve take-up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">I thank the Tánaiste. There is a huge opportunity with that. I would like to know what level of interest has been expressed to him on the State-backed guarantee scheme. I recall during Covid there was scepticism about a previous iteration of that but the number of companies taking up the opportunity of those loans was actually very high. It is something that could be kept in perpetuity as a model for financing corporates that are trying to get through difficult periods or trying to expand in particular ways. The Family Business Network highlighted to me that energy is a major element in manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">Among its members, on average, fuel costs have gone up 80%, freight costs are up 20% and chemical, steel and similar input costs have gone up between 15% and 25%. These are major additional costs for any business. I will address energy prices in my next contribution.</p>

The first of the main banks will be offering it in the next few weeks. We will have a better idea in six weeks or six months. What I can say for sure, though, is that the growth and stability loan scheme will be very popular. It is the follow-up to the future growth loan scheme, which was fully subscribed. This is for businesses that are expanding and want to invest in energy efficiency. We think that scheme will be very popular.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">I tend to agree. As the Tánaiste becomes Taoiseach this weekend, I make one request of him in relation to the opportunity he identified on wind energy. I met representatives of a group of wind companies form Denmark, Norway and Ireland, which have European- and Irish-backed funds. They spoke to me about the opportunity in Ireland and said we are possibly missing the chance to realise it quickly enough because of the gaps in planning, grid and demand certainty. Even if the first round of auctions goes through and that becomes operational, we will have much more capacity than demand on the island. These companies are making the point that without data centres running as a constant, they cannot be sure there will be sufficient use. There is so more use needed - I am sorry, it is 1 a.m. and I am not saying this well – to be able to sustain the amount of energy produced. They have to build into the risk profile the possibility of turning off turbines in the absence of demand certainty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570"> EirGrid told me, and this is important to highlight, that it has missed target after target in relation to grid certainty. While the company needs more resources, it also needs to deliver the grid development target set for it. I know there is a big change on the way in planning. There is no point in talking about 800,000 sq. km of opportunity. It simply has to get done on a practical basis now before the financing investment moves elsewhere in Europe or to the United States and we lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

I can see how that could flip very quickly and we would then be wondering why we did not see it coming. We cannot say that now because the Deputy raised it in the Dáil. We have to be prepared for demand certainty. The best way we can mitigate that is through interconnection, so that if there is excess energy being produced, it can be exported. I do not think the connection to France will be enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_1582">As the Deputy may be aware, IDA Ireland released annual results yesterday. More than 24,000 net new jobs were created – the highest year on record. More than half of new investments went to locations outside of Dublin. Employment was up in every part of the country, including the mid-west, where it grew by 3.6%. Total employment in IDA Ireland client companies now stands at more than 300,000 for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583"> IDA Ireland is placing an increased focus on sustainability and its current strategy targets 60 sustainability investments, that is, investments by client companies that contribute towards decarbonisation and the green transition. We secured 21 of these in 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584"> It is essential that there are serviceable sites with appropriate zoning, planning and the required infrastructure in all parts of Ireland to attract foreign direct investment, FDI. IDA Ireland's regional property programme uses leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, accreditation to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency in its building programme. Successful initiatives to date include simple yet impactful steps, such as the installation of more efficient public lighting and an enhanced focus on sustainable models of transport, for example, public transport links to business parks. It has invested in and installed bus and cycle infrastructure, where possible, in flagship parks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585"> I am advised that IDA Ireland's property division is working with Limerick City and County Council in designing a new cycle lane along the banks of the River Shannon and River Mulcair to the north and east of the national technology park in Castletroy. In addition, I am informed that IDA Ireland made a written submission to the draft Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport study in relation to transport links in the city.

It is a very good strategy. As the Tánaiste will know, there is a very ambitious plan for development of bus and rail networks in Limerick city as well as active travel networks. He will also know that the Government is reopening the Limerick to Foynes railway line.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587"> One of the major industrial estates in the country, not only in the mid-west, is the Raheen industrial estate. I have met IDA Ireland, the chief executives of some major companies located in the industrial estate and companies such as Eli Lilly, which has a very exciting plan to set up in it. It has secured planning permission and will commence development of its plant in the next few weeks. There is a fantastic opportunity to develop rail, particularly around this industrial estate. As I mentioned previously to the Minister, we could build a train station in it and I encourage him to keep that in mind as he takes up his new role. This is a matter we will come to in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_1588">I am glad to hear the draft strategy is now a strategy. I know the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very enthusiastic about metropolitan rail, particularly around Limerick and Cork. I have been to Raheen industrial park through Regeneron. I hope to see the Eli Lilly plant under way very soon now that the planning permission has been secured. I do not know the exact geography but I understand it would be possible to provide a railway station there as part of the Limerick-Foynes line. That would be a huge boost to have Limerick metropolitan rail serving Ennis in County Clare all the way to Adare and Foynes. Having stations along the way makes a lot of sense and would allow us to have much more sustainable and centralised development rather than the sprawl we have seen in pretty much all of the other cities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1589">I agree and a train station in Raheen is in phase 2 of the plan. The question is when phase 2 will happen. We can make a case for it to begin sooner rather than later. There is a role for IDA Ireland to be proactive and work with the NTA and the local authority to make that happen. It is genuinely a very exciting plan for Limerick and the whole mid-west region. It will also help rebalance investment towards the west and mid-west, which is critically important and is supported by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590"> I realise I am the last Deputy to ask the Tánaiste an oral parliamentary question in his tenure as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. He has had a very successful few years in the Department. I wish him the best in his new role as Taoiseach, which I think will be a very successful one.</p>

            <p eId="para_1591">I appreciate the Deputy’s kind words. I have enjoyed being the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the past two and a half years and working with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to create jobs around the country and improve workers' rights. I have enjoyed working with the three Ministers of State who have served with me in introducing some major legislative reforms in the areas of competition, company law and consumer law, establishing the Corporate Enforcement Authority, reforming the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and doing many others things in that period, which has really flown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">I will be around tomorrow and will be taking Leaders' Questions on Thursday so I have a number of Dáil appearances before Saturday. To answer the question, which is the most important thing, IDA Ireland has a role to play when it comes to promoting better rail access and better public transport to industrial parks. IDA Ireland gets very involved in air connectivity, which we all know is very important. Perhaps it needs to get a little more involved in thinking about how people get in and out of industrial sites because they do not always travel by car. There is definitely an opportunity in that regard and I will make sure it is on my agenda for future discussions with the agency.</p>
