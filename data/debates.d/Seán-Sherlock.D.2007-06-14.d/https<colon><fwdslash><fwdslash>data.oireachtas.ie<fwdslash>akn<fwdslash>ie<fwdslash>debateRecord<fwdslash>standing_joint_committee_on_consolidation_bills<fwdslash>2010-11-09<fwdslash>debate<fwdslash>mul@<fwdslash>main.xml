          <p eId="para_15">As members have been notified the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills meets today to consider the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010.  This Bill consolidates enactments relating to the value-added tax and has been so certified by the Attorney General.  No new law has been included in the Bill nor is it permissible to introduce new law by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  The joint committee has been empowered by orders of the Dáil and Seanad, passed on Wednesday and Thursday, 3 and 4 November 2010, to dispose of more than one section by any one question and if members are agreeable I propose to use this power so that the Bill can be processed as efficiently as possible.  May I have agreement that where no amendments are tabled to individual sections that we can take them in groups so as to assist the efficient passage of the Bill?  Is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_21">Amendment No. 1 has been disallowed as being a substantive amendment of the law under Standing Order 145.  The amendment seeks to replace the word "Department" with "Minister" in the definition of a public body.  This is not merely to correct an ambiguity or inconsistency or to adapt to existing law in practice as is allowed under Standing Order 145.  That is the reason I have been given.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">May I go back to the point I was raising?  I want to see this Bill dealt with properly and efficiently.  I have no objection to groupings but it is proposed to group sections 3 to 36, inclusive, together which covers Parts 1 to 4 and one section in Part 5.  Why should we dip into the first section of Part 5?  Is there some coherence in this grouping?  Section 36 which is added into that grouping deals with taxable amounts whereas the previous sections deal with different things.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I understand that the Bills Office made this proposal.  The Bill to deal with the consolidation of the Social Welfare Acts had similar groupings and this precedent was followed on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The reason that sections 3 to 36 were grouped together is that no amendments were tabled to these sections.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010 consolidates almost 40 years of VAT legislation as part of the ongoing modernisation of tax legislation.  The Bill which follows earlier tax consolidation exercises will make Irish VAT law more accessible and user friendly to Members of the Oireachtas, businesses, tax practitioners and students of taxation.  As I stated last week on the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010 has been restructured and remodelled as far as possible along the lines of the EU VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The most notable effect of this remodelling is that there are a far greater number of sections in the Bill.  While the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 contained 44 sections with a number of additional sections inserted through the Act, by means of successive finance Acts, the new Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill contains 125 sections, primarily due to expansive sections in the Acts being replaced and clarified by a number of separate sections in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I thank members of the committee for their input to date into this process, including the amendments brought forward today.  As members will be aware, consolidation Bills may not make any substantive changes to existing law and the Bill has been certified by the Attorney General as being a consolidation measure containing no legislative changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">While changes in existing legislation are not allowed in a consolidation Bill, some suggestions being made could be considered in the context of future finance Bills.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">It makes sense to go from 0% to 21% rather than from 21% to 0%, back up to 13.5% and then down again to 4.8%.  A tax practitioner or an unfortunate payer of tax must find his or her way through this maze and we wish to ensure it is as readable as possible.

          <p eId="para_81">This undoubtedly plausible amendment relates to section 46.  It concerns the paragraph order in which the different rates of VAT are presented.  The text in the Bill reflects section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act as currently worded.  It shows the 21% rate first, which is the standard or default rate and always referred to as the standard rate.  This is followed by the 0% rate, the 13.5% reduced rate and, finally, the livestock rate of 4.8%.  The proposed amendment re-orders the text to show the rate in numerical order.  This is a presentational issue and there is no difference in substance between the Bill as it stands now and what the amendment would do.  However, the proposed change would entail cross-reference amendments to several other sections.  More important, there is a logic, albeit a different one, in the way the rates are presented in the Bill with the standard rate appearing first before the exceptions to that rate.  For these reasons I do not accept the amendment.</p>

The amendment proposed that the words "for a period specified in regulations" be inserted to qualify this.  The text in the consolidation Bill reflects section 17(15) of the VAT Act as currently worded, and if accepted the proposed amendment could amount to a substantive change in the law, which is not permissible in a consolidation Bill.

          <p eId="para_105">This amendment relates to section 106 of the Bill, which deals with the care and management of VAT.  The section currently provides that tax is placed under the control and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 2 of the Bill defines the term "tax" as meaning value-added tax chargeable by virtue of the Act.  The term "tax" is used extensively throughout the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The amendment proposes that the term "tax" be replaced by the term "value-added tax chargeable by virtue of this Act" in section 106.  I do not consider that the proposed change would materially improve the Bill.  It may, in fact, lead to some confusion, as the term "tax" is defined in section 2 for the purposes of the whole Act and is widely used throughout the Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">It is a rather odd way of expressing the whole business of tax.  We never really thought of the Revenue Commissioners as being people who have care and management of tax.  One would have thought that the collection of tax was under their care and management, not tax generally.</p>
