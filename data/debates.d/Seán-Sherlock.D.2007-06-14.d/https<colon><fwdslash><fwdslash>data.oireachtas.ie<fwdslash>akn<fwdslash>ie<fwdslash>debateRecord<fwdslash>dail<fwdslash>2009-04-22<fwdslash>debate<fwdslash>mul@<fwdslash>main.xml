            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">Tackling organised and gangland crime remains my primary concern.  Significant efforts and resources are already being directed on an ongoing basis in tackling organised crime and gangland culture.  The State will be relentless in its approach in bringing those involved in such activities to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">An Garda Síochána already co-ordinates a wide range of multi-agency activities to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal gangs.  It is only fair to recognise and acknowledge it is having considerable success in this regard.  Intelligence-led operations are used by the Garda to target organised crime groups by utilising specialist units including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the organised crime unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">Targeted intelligence-led operations, such as Operation Anvil, continue to result in significant seizures of firearms and property related to criminal activity and have led to the arrests and prosecutions of those involved.  In terms of Garda resources, at a time when public finances are under extreme pressure, I have ensured that in the justice, equality and law reform area, top priority will continue to be given to front line policing activities.  For example, funding for Operation Anvil has increased in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million while that for the Criminal Assets Bureau has increased by €1.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The reprehensible killing of a person in Limerick recently can be seen as a clear attempt by organised criminal gangs to undermine the criminal justice system.  This demands a response from the State.  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, published last week, will enable material obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used as evidence to support or strengthen prosecutions. I hope the legislation will come before the House in the coming week or so.  In addition to this legislation, I am currently working on a range of other legislative measures to combat criminal gangs.  The proposals being considered include provisions similar to those previously introduced against subversive organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Finally, I reiterate that the Government attaches the highest priority to tackling organised and gangland crime and will spare no efforts in tackling those involved in such activities head on.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am conscious of the fact he has introduced new legislation which will be supported by my party, Fine Gael, as stated on numerous occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">Does the Minister agree that organised and gangland crime results from the illegal drug activities in this country and in particular, the importation of drugs?  What is the Minister's view on the issue by the Department of Transport of an international haulage licence to a convicted drug dealer?  Since the occurrence of this event in September 2008, what actions has the Minister taken first, to have consultations and discussions on the matter with his colleague the Minister for Transport, and, second, to have consultations and discussions with the Garda Commissioner?</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Has the Minister expressed concern on the matter?  If so, what action does he propose to take in order to allay the very serious public concern and to deal with the mixed message from his Department?  On the weekend that he issues a raft of new legislation which he suggests will tackle gangland crime, we have the situation of a known and convicted drug trafficker against whom very serious charges were dropped, which will later be the subject matter of a question from my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte.  What action is the Minister taking on this issue?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_3" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_10">It is true to say that illegal drugs and their importation is a very large component of the issue of gangland crime in this country.  To be fair, there is a question in regard to the related issue to which the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">With regard to the drugs issue generally, there is a special national drugs unit, comprising 60 gardaí of all ranks at headquarters, and across the country there are divisional drugs units with approximately 350 members who are specifically dedicated to the fight against drugs.  They work in conjunction with the Customs and Excise service and the Naval Service in regard to the importation of illegal drugs.  Given the fact we have extended the surveillance legislation to the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners as well as the Customs and Excise service, on many occasions there is a crossover between those three agencies in the fight against drugs.  The surveillance legislation will be of great benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy, it is only fair to point out that this will be answered in response to a later question.  I understand in regard to this issue generally that there is a private notice question for the Minister for Transport in regard to the granting of the licence in that case.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">The Minister may not be aware but that question will not be taken this afternoon.  On the specific matter as raised, what action does he propose to take to allay widespread fears of a cover-up in this matter?  When are the facts of this case to be laid bare?  Could he, as Minister for Justice——</p>

            <from>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I would prefer if the Minister would deal with that when the specific question is reached.  It is germane to the Deputy's question.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Where is the specific question on the issue of the international haulage licence to a convicted drug dealer?  There is none.  We are dealing here with gangland crime.  We are dealing with my question to the Minister regarding his intentions in terms of dealing with the issue of gangland crime.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Leas-Cheann_Comhairle" eId="spk_7">

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_17">As I said at the outset, gangland crime and drugs are inextricably linked.  We would not have gangland crime if we did not have drugs.  The mixed messages being sent by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this case are only adding to the fear of a cover-up because certain aspects of this case stink.  It is very important that the Minister ensures we know the facts of the case and who is protecting this man.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">I ask the Minister to use his influence in this regard.  As the Minister with special responsibility for crime and security in the State, I ask him to ask the Minister for Transport to revoke all licences that issued to convicted drug dealers that allow them to engage in international haulage contracting.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_19">I am somewhat reluctant to deal with the matter in response to this question because to be fair to Deputy Rabbitte he has tabled a priority question specifically on that issue.  When this issue first arose in the media, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which we established as an independent agency, set up a public interest inquiry under section 102 of the 2005 Act that we passed.  Section 67 of the 2005 Act is explicit that the investigation of these issues by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is totally independent of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Garda Síochána and this House.  When the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission decides to have a public interest inquiry it is best to leave it to it so that we do not prejudice anything.  Of course people are concerned — I accept that.  The Minister for Transport has already indicated his concern in this regard.  I have confirmed with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission today through the Garda Commissioner and people in my Department that the granting of the licence will be part of its examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I know that political charges have been made in this House.  Neither my Department nor I had any hand, act or part in the granting of any of these licences, which is purely a matter for the Department of Transport liaising with the Garda Síochána.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if he has received communication from the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission regarding a possible public interest inquiry into the circumstances in which serious drug charges against a person (details supplied) were dropped; if the internal Garda inquiry into the affair has been concluded; if he has received a report from the Garda on its inquiry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_23">I have previously informed the House that I received an interim report from the Garda Commissioner concerning certain inquiries being carried out by an assistant commissioner into events related to a particular case involving a convicted drug dealer.  I am informed by the Commissioner that those inquiries are still ongoing and I await a full report from the Commissioner as soon as those inquiries have been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">The House will be aware that when this matter first came to light I agreed to a request from the Garda Commissioner that the interim report which he had provided to me should be forwarded to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  The ombudsman commission has indicated that it is conducting a public interest inquiry relating to the case.  The ombudsman commission is well placed to look into all aspects of this case and to establish the full facts.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there is ongoing liaison between the Garda Síochána and the ombudsman commission on its inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">Deputies will be well aware that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is an independent authority established under the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  The independence of the ombudsman commission is a cornerstone of its operations and an important guarantee of its integrity.  I am sure no Member of this House would suggest that I should interfere in this, or any, investigation being carried out by the ombudsman commission.  Accordingly, I propose to await the report of its investigation into the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">In the circumstances, therefore, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to make further comment about the case pending the outcome of the ombudsman commission's work.  It goes without saying that if any action on my part is required as a result of the ombudsman commission's investigations then I will take it.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">The House will be well aware that there has been considerable media publicity in recent days concerning the issue of a road haulage operator's licence to the person referred to in the Deputy's question.  That issue is the subject of a separate review by the Minister for Transport.  I hope the House will appreciate, therefore, that I am somewhat constrained in what I can say about the matter and accept that we must await the establishment of the facts in this case, in particular by the ombudsman commission.  The ombudsman commission has confirmed to us that it has included the issue of the granting of the licence to this person as part of its remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">How long does the Minister intend continuing to tell the House that it is an interim report?  This matter happened on 31 July last year.  How long does the Minister think he needs in order to come in here and outline plain facts about this case?  I ask him to stop sheltering behind the ombudsman commission.  If he is not sheltering behind the skirts of the ombudsman commission he is sheltering behind the Minister for Transport.  The bare facts are that this person was found red-handed in possession of €1.7 million worth of drugs and the charge was dropped.  A <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered on the last day of the court term without notice to the court.  How can the Minister explain that? He has just said the drugs trafficking trade is a large component of the driving of the phenomenon of gangland crime.  How could a convicted drugs importer get an international licence to import death into this country, despite his convictions?  The Minister comes in here as the man responsible for the Garda Síochána and says to us the matter is with the ombudsman commission or the Minister for Transport.  People are in disbelief that somebody with three serious convictions and then caught red-handed in possession of a huge consignment of drugs had the charges dropped.  Now somebody is covering up for him and issuing a licence to him to repeat the performance.  I find this beyond belief.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_29">There was no delay on my part.  When I got the interim report from the Garda Síochána Commissioner, I suggested, and it was agreed, that the interim report would be sent to the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  I did so because it raised serious questions and serious questions were being raised in the media on the issue.  As I said, with regard to the granting of a licence, neither I nor the Department had received any communication on the issue.  The issue of a "good repute" check was purely a matter between the Department of Transport and the Garda Síochána, as is always the case.  I understand the Department of Transport generally seeks the Attorney General's advice on the granting of a licence in circumstances where people have previous convictions.  I am not speaking about this specific case, but this is generally the case where people have previous convictions, such as where those with previous convictions apply for taxi licences.  There is considerable case law in that area and there have been successful challenges in the courts where the Department of Transport has been obliged to grant a licence, even though people have been convicted of previous offences.  I am speaking generally in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The Deputy has said there is disbelief.  There would be disbelief if this House or any politician were to interfere in the independent process that was set up by the House to investigate complaints against gardaí.  That is the reason we have the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  It is investigating the situation and has upgraded its investigation into a public interest inquiry.  It would be very wrong of me, the Deputy or anyone in the House to interfere with that.  I will not do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">The Minister has responsibility for the Garda Síochána.  He has just said an interim report was given to him some months ago.  This event happened on 31 July.  How long does it take for the Garda Síochána to complete its report?  Is the Minister satisfied a <i>nolle prosequi</i>  was entered in the circumstances described?  Is he satisfied that should have happened?</p>
            <p eId="para_32">With regard to the person concerned, the information is that he is not, after all, a Garda informant.  Therefore, who is running, sheltering and protecting him?  Are the individual gardaí sheltering him acting on their own accord?  Do they think they are acting in the public interest or are they acting for corrupt purpose?  After all we have seen and after the Minister's admission that a large component of the gangland feuding that is wrecking some of our communities is driven by the drugs trafficking trade, I would have thought that as Minister he would want to hear from the Garda Síochána, after ten months, what the hell was going on.  I would think he would want to hear why a convicted drugs dealer could get a licence to resume importing death into this country, if that is his disposition, and to do that with impunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">With regard to the report, the Garda quickly produced an interim report.  That interim report was referred immediately to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  A final report by the Garda Síochána is due and it will, ultimately, be fed into the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  On the issue of a <i>nolle prosequi,</i> it is not for me to say whether that should have been put into the District Court at that time.  That is not an issue for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but an issue for the independent DPP, as the Deputy well knows.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">Regarding the Deputy's allegations about people being informers or gardaí being complicit in any wrongdoing, I strongly suggest that he leave the matter to the independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which was rightly established and given powers by the House in the aftermath of the Morris tribunal, to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing.  It should be done by an independent body not this House.  We do not need to set up independent tribunals.  Rather, the commission should be allowed to get on with its work.  If it makes recommendations, the House and I will bear them in mind and pass whatever legislation or orders are necessary to ensure the like does not recur.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the measures his Department has to track the movements and behaviour of known serious criminals living in housing estates; the checks and protections in place to protect residents and public safety in estates in which criminals are known to reside; and if he liaises with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to advise it of the level of income such people derive from criminal activity for consideration by that Department in determining their eligibility for social welfare payments, rent supplement and other State benefits.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_24" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_42">Persons involved in organised criminal activities are being targeted by An Garda Síochána in a number of ways, including uniform and plain clothes personnel overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of criminal activities.  Such criminals, their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are proactively targeted through intelligence-led operations, for example, Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">Multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where all of the national units from the Garda national support services are used to combat serious crime.  In addition, an intensified programme of multi-agency checkpoints involving officers from the Department of Social and Family Affairs is being undertaken.  The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, which includes a number of social welfare inspectors appointed as bureau officers, is being actively utilised to identify and target funds accumulated by criminals in order to seize such assets and to deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">Some 102 Garda divisional asset profilers have been trained by CAB and are now in place in every Garda division.  Their role is to collate information at a local level and to carry out preparatory groundwork in advance of a full investigation by CAB.  The social welfare inspectors attached to the bureau investigate and determine social welfare entitlements of persons who derive assets from criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">In addition, the regional director's office of the Department of Social and Family Affairs fully co-operates with all requests by CAB officers in respect of cases and refers departmental cases deemed suitable for consideration of investigation and determination by the bureau.  The effectiveness of this approach can be seen from the fact that, in the period since CAB's inception up to the end of 2007, it made savings of more than €3.5 million and recovered €2.5 million in respect of social welfare payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">Is the Minister satisfied with the <i>entente</i> between his Department and elements of the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under their respective Ministers, Deputies Hanafin and Gormley?  The Garda is spending significant funds on trying to track and pursue known criminals to the best of its ability.  On Tuesday mornings, however, they show up at their local unemployment exchanges and get money from the State.  They also get rent allowance, as the relevant local authorities have sanctioned their housing needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">It is coming.  Criminals are robbing, selling drugs and acquiring the criminal assets referred to by Deputies Charles Flanagan and Rabbitte.  Is there co-operation between the relevant Departments and is the Minister satisfied that it is sufficient?  I am not.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I am satisfied with the co-operation.  While I was the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs from 1997 to 2002, I instigated multi-agency checkpoints, which were criticised by parts of the House.  The checkpoints comprised gardaí, social welfare officers and officials from the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, customs and Revenue.  Over the years, the checkpoints have gone somewhat into abeyance.  Thanks to an initiative I took in more recent times in my current Ministry, the multi-agency checkpoints are up and running and meeting with significant success.  This is in addition to the ongoing co-operation between the Departments.  Moreover, as I noted in my previous response, social welfare officers are seconded to the CAB and there is close liaison between the CAB and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that those involved in criminal activity do not obtain social welfare payments.  As the Deputy will note from the figures provided, significant savings have been made in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">While the Minister may be satisfied, I am not.

On investigating this issue, I discovered the person in question is in receipt of rent allowance and benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">Absolutely.  If one considers the social welfare Vote, in which there have been savings of €476 million through fraud controls in 2008, this is a wider issue.  There is a concentrated issue that pertains in particular to those involved in gangland crime.  Such people are profiled through the CAB profilers, of whom there are 102 and who operate in every Garda district nationwide, to ensure that everyone in the system, whether in social welfare, customs, Revenue, the Garda Síochána or any other Department, is aware of the involvement of those people.</p>

         asked the

         if the public service recruitment embargo, announced on 26 March 2009, will apply to the recruitment of full-time members of the Garda or the Garda Reserve; if it will apply to civilian employees working for the Garda; if an assessment has been carried out on the implications for policing and of the number of gardaí who will have to be diverted from full-time policing duties as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_36" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_58">As the Minister for Finance has made clear, the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service applies to the Garda Síochána, both members and civilian support staff.  By its nature, it has no application to the Garda Reserve, whose members are unpaid volunteers who do not occupy public service posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">The Minister for Finance also made clear that this measure is not an embargo, which would mean a blanket ban on filling all posts.  Instead, the nature of this moratorium will permit the Minister for Finance to approve the filling of some vacancies in exceptional circumstances.  I am engaged in consultations at present with the Garda Commissioner on the case for filling certain senior posts in the force, particularly those carrying statutory functions or those otherwise in key operational areas, and I will discuss the outcome with the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">The Government decision also permits the filling of vacancies by redeployment of staff and again I will explore the case and scope for so doing in respect of the civilian support staff of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda information services centre, which delivers a vital service to the force and which was largely staffed through redeployment, shows the potential in this regard in the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">It is also important to bear in mind that Garda strength has increased significantly in recent years, with the number of attested members rising from 10,968 at the end of 1997 to 11,895 at the end of 2002, 13,755 at the end of 2007 and 14,371 in the most recent figures.  Allowing for attestations in 2009, the strength of the force will reach approximately 14,900 by 31 December 2009.  There has also been a significant increase in civilian support staff, with the most recent figures indicating that the total number of whole-time equivalent civilian personnel has risen from 1,688 at the end of 2007 to 2,133.  Consequently, while the moratorium will have a temporary effect on recruitment into the Garda Síochána, its record strength means that it is in the best possible position to absorb the impact and continue to deliver a top-class policing service.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The allocation of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and is continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">May I take it from this response that the moratorium will have no effect on the Garda and that the figure will be 14,900, as the Minister informed me on 25 February?  That appears to be the answer.  The Minister should inform the House how many gardaí qualified in the first quarter of 2009, how many will qualify in the second quarter and how many he expects to qualify in each of the third and fourth quarters.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I do not have those figures in respect of each quarter but somewhere in the region of 200 or 250 gardaí, the same number as have come through until recently, have continued to flow through the system until the end of the year.  A smaller intake, 100 per quarter, was taken on over the past two quarters.  In 2010 the number of attested gardaí qualifying will be reduced.  Regarding the figure of 14,900, we estimate this to be the figure by the end of 2009.  Much depends on retirements.  This Government has been assiduous in increasing the levels of gardaí over the past number of years.  We will do our best to keep the numbers as high as we can.</p>

The country is coming down with crime, there are killings every weekend, anti-social behaviour is rife and, when Deputy Ahern was on this side of the House, if a letter went missing in the Department he was jumping up and down on the shoulders of the man who is now the Ceann Comhairle.  It is an unbelievable crisis.  The country is in mayhem.  If the Government had not made such a mess of the economy, this would be at the top of the agenda.  The Minister comes in and tells this House he does not know how many gardaí will qualify in 2009.  He is making a farce out of Question Time.</p>

         the steps he is taking to expedite current asylum applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_57" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_86">I attach a high level of priority to ensuring that asylum applications are dealt with fairly and as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the cost to the State.  Processing times and scheduling arrangements are kept under ongoing review by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation or decision.  In 2008, some 4,581 applications were processed to completion by ORAC with 2,461 appeals concluded by RAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">As indicated in previous replies on this matter, a number of steps have been taken in recent years to expedite the processing of asylum applications.  These include the introduction of prioritised arrangements for the processing of applications from certain source countries; the scheduling by ORAC of interviews on the date of application; and maximising the use of the Dublin II regulation to determine the appropriate European state responsible for processing asylum applications made in Ireland.  The effectiveness of these measures can be seen in the continuing improvements in processing times at first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">More recent developments include the introduction by RAT in 2008 of a new on-line system of access to previous tribunal decisions.  The new system enables legal representatives of applicants to more readily access past tribunal decisions and thus speed up the scheduling of appeals hearings by RAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">In addition, the recruitment of a panel of presenting officers by ORAC to supplement its own presenting team in servicing appeal hearings has enabled RAT to almost double the number of appeal hearings being scheduled.  These changes will help to further improve appeal processing timetables.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">All of this work is undertaken in the context of increasing levels of abuse of the asylum process and the growing complexity of cases from a mix of over 100 countries, such as Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  As I have said previously, the vast majority of applicants do not possess any identity documentation on arrival in the State.  This is despite the fact that many indicate they have travelled by air, which would have required identity documentation at the point of departure.  This is but one of the many abuses evident in our asylum process today.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">Looking to the future, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008. which is currently before the House, sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the State's immigration and protection laws.  The enactment of the Bill will be a key measure for achieving efficiencies in the asylum applications processing system itself, for establishing a more effective and streamlined removal process and for tackling abuses which the asylum and immigration systems have to contend with, including apparent abuses of the judicial review system.  The Bill provides for the subsuming of ORAC into the Department and the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds, including protection grounds, put forward by applicants for protection.  This new integrated process will bring the State into line with processes in other EU states.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">At the outset I accept that ORAC and RAT have dramatically improved the processing of applications.  Is it not the case that we have approximately 7,000 asylum seekers in the system currently, with the number varying between 7,000 and 8,000?</p>
            <p eId="para_94">The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, have indicated that a significant part of the delay is the judicial review element.  Will the Minister sit down and have a cup of coffee with the President of the High Court and propose to him the introduction of a special arrangement for the month of September to process the outstanding cases before the courts regarding judicial review?  There are approximately 700 before the courts and if 15 High Court judges sat during September, the backlog would be virtually cleared.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">The President of the High Court has allocated two additional judges since the start of 2009 to the asylum list, so there are four judges now dealing with these cases.  I welcome the Deputy's complimentary words regarding ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Some 90% of asylum applications are ultimately seen to be unfounded and a third of those people claiming asylum reveal an immigration history in the UK.  There are some very dramatic figures.  The total number since 1992 which have claimed asylum is over 81,000, with a peak figure of 11,600 in 2002.  That number is now much lower and in 2008 it was 3,800.  To date in 2009, there have been 794 applications.  We are catching up on the backlog.  The average monthly application figure to the end of 2003 was between 830 and 840 and more recently, in January, it was 254.  There has been a decrease in the number of applications, which suggests that many asylum seekers were coming for economic rather than asylum reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared to discuss this matter with the President of the High Court.  A substantial part of the delay in the Department processing asylum applications results from delays in processing leave to remain applications.  While I accept that the latter are complex, based on the current rate of processing it would take approximately five years to clear the existing backlog of such applications.  Is the Minister of the view that this is unacceptable, particularly in light of the fact that €800 per week is spent on the court, accommodation, processing and deportation costs of each asylum applicant?  Would it not make sense to allocate additional resources to process the leave to remain applications to which I refer in order that people who are eligible for refugee status in this country will be granted it as quickly as possible and that those who are deemed not to be eligible will be returned to their home countries as soon as possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_110">The killing of Roy Collins is deplored by all right-thinking people and our sympathy is with his family and friends.  The killing remains under active investigation by An Garda Síochána in Limerick, with assistance being provided, as required, by Garda national support services.  A number of persons have been arrested and detained in the course of the investigation.  One person has been charged in connection with this killing and the House will appreciate that consequently I am greatly constrained in what I can say about the specific incident.  An Garda Síochána is in ongoing contact with the family of the deceased.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">Considerable Garda resources within the Limerick Garda division are targeted at disrupting the activities of the criminal groupings.   The regional support unit carries out armed patrols and other units, such as the emergency response unit and the units of national support services are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">We cannot allow organised criminal gangs to attempt to undermine the criminal justice system.  Such behaviour demands a response from the State and such a response will be forthcoming.  The publication of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill last week will strengthen the ability of An Garda Síochána to bring gang members before the courts and offer evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">In addition, I have indicated that I am working on a range of other measures to combat intimidation by criminal gangs.  These measures include: greater use of the Special Criminal Court; creating new offences of membership of and directing a criminal organisation; making these offences scheduled offences as regards the Special Criminal Court; simplifying the procedures relating to extension of time for questioning of suspects; and increasing the penalties for intimidation of a witness or juror.  I expect to submit proposals in this regard to the Government for its approval in the coming weeks.</p>

I accept that the Minister is not in a position to comment directly on the case in question.  There is absolute abhorrence among the people of Limerick regarding the circumstances and background relating to this crime.  In light of the Minister's reply to an earlier question tabled by Deputy Rabbitte in respect of recently announced cutbacks, will the Garda presence in Limerick remain at current levels?</p>
            <p eId="para_115">It is clear that the family of the late Mr. Collins has been targeted.  In that context, is the Minister carrying out a review in respect of the protection of people who are so targeted?  I accept that intensive Garda activity is required when it comes to protecting families that are at risk of attack.  Can the Minister give a timeframe for the other measures that will be brought to Cabinet, particularly the offence of directing and belonging to a criminal gang?  People expected a quicker response following the murder of Shane Geoghegan, particularly with regard to covert surveillance legislation, which has taken a long time to publish.  We need an urgent response.  What is the timeframe for these measures?</p>

I welcome the support of Members of the House, particularly on the necessity for the use of these special arrangements.

The success rate of prosecutions for gangland crime is better in Limerick than anywhere else.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Having said that, I believe, as does the House, that recent events, not least the murders of Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins, were an affront to society and to those decent people who were prepared to come forward to give evidence.  The State must respond and that is why we are fast-tracking surveillance legislation in the wake of the murder of Shane Geoghegan and the recent murders in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">It is not simple legislation because there are significant issues related to privacy and private property, as outlined in the Constitution.  That balance must be struck and to be fair to the Attorney General and his staff, we have succeeded, given that it is subject to judicial oversight and authorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">There are currently 625 gardaí in Limerick, an increase in the last 18 months of 100.  There are 80 gardaí specifically earmarked for certain troubled areas in Limerick.  Limerick is one of the most, if not the most, policed areas in the State.  The numbers will be kept as high as possible and I do not envisage those numbers being reduced as long as this affront to Irish society exists.</p>

It has been published, which Fine Gael welcomes, but it must be debated, enacted and fully implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">With regard to the additional measures, I believed, after consultation with the Attorney General, my Department, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, they were necessary in view of what has happened in recent weeks.  I strongly suggest, in the context of potentially moving gangland offences into the Special Criminal Court, that Deputies on all sides of the House give us their information relating to the issue of intimidation of jurors and witnesses.  Obviously, under the Constitution we must be extremely careful about deviating from the use of ordinary courts.  Empirical evidence to date shows that the courts in Limerick have been reasonably successful, indeed more successful than those in some other areas, in gaining convictions.  However, recent events have, in my view, crossed the line and the Oireachtas must respond.  It is not a decision we should take lightly but if there are people——</p>

            <p eId="para_131">If there are people who are in fear of intimidation, and I understand from the Garda, the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and others that there is intimidation of witnesses and jurors, particularly in the context of recent events, and even though we recently changed the legislation relating to the issue of intimidation of witnesses, I am prepared to increase the penalties to more than ten years.  That is an important signal.  I hope to bring those measures before the Government for approval within weeks.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_132">The Minister asked for information about witness intimidation.  I will supply information to him on such a case.  The person felt he was coerced to give evidence; he felt he had no other choice.  He gave evidence and was posted out of the country in the witness protection programme at very great cost to himself and his family.  He is back in the jurisdiction and feels that he is not protected and safe.  He believes it has not worked as it ought.  I will furnish that information to the Minister after Question Time, in the hope that he will treat it with a little more discretion and confidence than he treated the last information I gave him.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">What caused the change of heart in the Department regarding the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill 2007?  I published the Bill in November 2007, and the Minister's predecessor said, in a memorable phrase, that all it would do is "alert the criminals to Garda investigative techniques".  That seemed to indicate that both the Department and the Garda Síochána were opposed to evidence gathered in that fashion being made admissible in court.  It appears to have taken the murder of Shane Geoghegan and the recent tragedy that befell the Collins family to change the mindset.  Will the Minister explain why they have come around to the point of view that the principles I set out in that Bill are what is required?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_134">It is the case that there was a change of view in the Garda Síochána, and that long predated the murders of Shane Geoghegan and Mr. Collins.  It has to be accepted that for decades the Garda has been using electronic surveillance.  Obviously, it is being used to a certain extent without statutory authority.  Gardaí have been limited in what they can do given the prohibition in the Constitution relating to the right to private property and the issue of privacy.  From that point of view the Garda approached the Department a considerable time ago and stated that it wished to move on this.  The Garda wished to have statutory footing to ensure gardaí were not operating contrary to the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">Equally, the Garda came to the view that there were cases emerging where it might be necessary to use this material as evidence in court.  Previously, as the material was, in effect, covert and not regulated and legalised, the Garda could not use it as evidence.  Now the Garda will have the option, particularly in the context of gangland crime, to use this as necessary.  However, in certain circumstances gardaí might decide not to proffer this as evidence and the Director of Public Prosecutions ultimately might not use it in support of a case.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">The Minister speaks about a change of mind or heart and change of policy on the part of the Garda Síochána.  I wish to ask him about a change of mind and policy on the part of the Government.  As recently as last November, following the murder of Shane Geoghegan, the Taoiseach was questioned on the matter.  He indicated that there were no plans to introduce legislation on gangland crime.  When asked in particular about section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, relating to the conviction of a person for gang membership, the Taoiseach said the legal advice to the Government was that this was inoperable and perhaps unconstitutional.  However, the Minister promised such legislation last week.  Why the change?  Has he taken legal advice on the matter?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_138">Again, there is no change of heart with regard to any of those matters.  What we are examining more intensely is the issue of directing a criminal organisation, which is not covered in existing legislation, and to mirror, in effect, the offences that were introduced after 1998 and the Omagh bombing.  That is what we propose to do.  There has been a ratcheting up of attacks on and intimidation of people, particularly in the Limerick area, and we must respond to that.  Obviously, it is an evolving situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">The Taoiseach and I, in the aftermath of the Shane Geoghegan killing, were referring to the issue of opinion evidence.  While members of the Deputy's party were proposing, quite rightly, that this should be used, I asked the Attorney General to examine the issue again.  It had previously been examined in 2006 by the previous Attorney General.  The current Attorney General confirmed the view that the courts use opinion evidence very sparingly and require significant corroborative evidence.  Hopefully, the passing of the proposed legislation before the summer recess, which I expect the Opposition to facilitate, would be an important tool in adding to that corroborative evidence in the context of opinion evidence subsequently used.</p>

        <b>Deputy Seán Barrett</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         his views on the composition of juries; if he plans to introduce legislative reform in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_91" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_141">The Law Reform Commission has included a review of the law on juries in its "Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014".  The Government will, of course, be considering in due course the recommendations made by the commission, including those relating to the composition of juries.  Part 6 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 has already made a number of amendments to the Juries Act 1976 which affect the composition of juries.  The most important change was the abolition of the upper age limit of 70 years for eligibility to serve on a jury.  A person called for jury service remains entitled to be excused from service where he or she is over the age of 65 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">Another important change is contained in the First Schedule to the Juries Act.  The category of "incapable person" defined as being "a person who because of insufficient capacity to read, deafness or other permanent infirmity is unfit to serve on a jury" has been replaced by a category of "other persons" defined in more disability-friendly terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">Section 55 amends section 11 of the Juries Act.  The effect of this amendment is to provide an option exercisable by a county registrar to form panels for the Central Criminal Court and Circuit Court separately or to form one panel for both courts.  This will facilitate the operation of the new Criminal Courts of Justice which will have a single jury assembly area and should also facilitate sittings of the Central Criminal Court which now sits regularly outside of Dublin.  An amendment to section 12 which allows a person selected as a juror to be called to a place or reception area other than a court will also facilitate the operation of the new complex beside Heuston Station.  Sections 60 to 63 of the Act amend sections 34 to 37 of the Juries Act by increasing tenfold the amount which may be levied by way of a fine for offences under the Juries Act.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_144">Having mentioned Special Criminal Courts and non-jury courts, it is timely to remind the House of the fundamental role played by juries and jurors in the criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">Is the Minister concerned at the large numbers of professionals who are excluded from jury service and are thereby disconnected from the administration of justice?  For example, why are vets, airline pilots, nurses and dentists excluded from jury service?  Does the Minister believe juries are therefore representative of the community?  Perhaps it is time we considered reforming the jury system to ensure juries both reflect and represent society as a whole.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_146">I would not be averse to having a look again at the composition of juries but certain occupations have been excluded because of the nature of their work.  I am prepared to consider that issue in the context of any amendments but I would not like it to hold up the proposals in connection with gangland crime and some other issues to which I referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">One measure we will consider in the context of gangland crime and the intimidation of witnesses and jurors is to increase the penalty from the existing ten years to approximately 15 years.  That is an important statement by this House to the wider community that the intimidation of a witness would be akin to the most serious offences that are punishable in the criminal courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_148">I am interested in the reply the Minister gave at the outset.  I seek clarification as to whether the recent changes allow for people who are profoundly deaf to serve on juries.  What category of person is currently excluded and what are the reasons for such?  Has any person been refused permission to serve on a jury since the changes were introduced to jury service last year?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_149">The change related only to the type of language used in the legislation.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody has been refused.  I do not have any information on file in that regard.  The new wording makes no specific reference to a particular disability, rather it refers to non-specific permanent infirmity, which would render it impracticable for persons to perform jury duty.  Such designation would apply equally to persons with or without a disability.</p>

I am not sure what is the case from the package the Minister announced to accompany the surveillance Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">We are considering the scheduling of new offences of directing a criminal gang and membership of a criminal gang.  Under the 2006 legislation there is the existing offence of participation in a criminal gang.  It is the intention — subject to legal advice — to link that in some way to the Special Criminal Court, given that there is strong anecdotal evidence on the intimidation of witnesses, and the fear of witnesses, especially in the context of the murder of Roy Collins.  We are considering the matter and I have already had significant meetings with the Garda Commissioner, the Secretary General of my Department and the Attorney General.  We had a two-hour meeting yesterday to see how we can proceed.  A further meeting of officials from all of those agencies will take place in the coming days to bring forward some of the changes I indicated are necessary in the aftermath of recent events.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 76, 99 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">I am pleased to indicate that in launching its new strategic plan on 4 April 2009 for the period 2009 to 2011 entitled, Equality for All in a Time of Change, the Equality Authority fully reaffirmed its determination to continue its important work, while fully acknowledging the changed financial circumstances in which all public bodies operate.  I extended my support for the policy contained in the strategic plan when I met the authority on the day of the launch of its plan.  The plan highlights the positive contribution that an environment free from discrimination can make to competitiveness and economic recovery.  The plan obliges the authority to participate actively in initiatives to promote policy for economic development and competitiveness through enhanced diversity and equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">For the information of the House I can also state that, notwithstanding the general moratorium on the filling of public service vacancies, the recruitment of a new CEO for the authority is going ahead under the auspices of a public competition being organised by the Public Appointments Service.  I am advised that there is a considerable level of interest in the post and therefore it will be some weeks yet before a candidate is selected for appointment under the normal statutory procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">As I previously indicated to the House, I recently agreed in principle to a request from the chair of the Equality Authority to suspend the transfer of staff from Dublin to Roscrea on the grounds of hardship.  I asked my officials to work out the details on a case-by-case basis with the acting chief executive officer of the authority and to review the situation again in 2011 when other aspects of the wider decentralisation programme are due to be reviewed.  Pending that review there will be no further increase in the number of staff in the Roscrea office of the authority, which will be 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programme will undertake an independent analysis of the position relating to the budget, efficiencies and capacity of the Equality Authority to independently and effectively fulfil its statutory functions.  There is no predetermined outcome to that review.  I expect the group to take the authority's allocation in 2008 as its starting point given the significant changes that have taken place in the authority in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">Again, as I previously stated in the House, the Government is fully committed to the equality agenda and the ongoing work of the Equality Authority.  Since it became fully operational in 1999 more than €45 million has been provided by the State for the activities of the Equality Authority alone.  At least another €30 million was provided to other bodies — the Equality Tribunal and the Human Rights Commission — that have been involved in equality related issues in the past six to seven years.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">Will the Minister confirm whether the reply he just gave to the House is official Government policy or is it his policy on the issue?  Was his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, telling the truth at the recent Green Party conference in March when he stated he had succeeded in reversing the cuts to the Equality Authority, and that he had succeeded also in halting the decentralisation of the headquarters of the authority to Roscrea in County Tipperary?  Is the Green Party now deciding policy in this issue or is the Minister, Deputy Gormley, being less than frank with the truth?</p>
            <p eId="para_163">In respect of the Roscrea situation, are we now going to have two Equality Authority offices, the Minister, Deputy Gormley's rump in Dublin, which he calls the headquarters and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern's decentralised offices in Roscrea?  This shambles is of the Minister's making and the sooner it is sorted the better.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_164">This is not a shambles.  It was originally agreed that the majority of the Equality Authority would decentralise to Roscrea and that a core staff would remain in Dublin.  The Government made the decision in the context of the tightening budgetary situation last year that we would, in effect, suspend decentralisation for the majority of the projects, especially in those areas where no contracts had been agreed for the construction of buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">There were three separate categories.  Some were ready to go to contract or contracts were more or less finalised.  In the case of others, interim arrangements were in place, such as the Equality Authority, where people had already decentralised to Roscrea and were <i>in situ</i>  there — a number of agencies had a dual location.  There were others that had not gone to contract and in respect of which people were not in temporary accommodation.  The Government decided these would no longer go ahead.  With regard to the Equality Authority, there were a number of people in Roscrea and a number in Dublin.  There is no difference of opinion between myself and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  The fact is——</p>

The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, claims the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reversed the cuts to the budget of the Equality Authority.  Is this true or false?  When the latter gutted the Equality Authority and drove out the chief executive in an act of vindictiveness, did he reverse his decision?</p>
            <p eId="para_172">I note the Minister is to recruit a new CEO.  I suppose that will take a while because he will have to be sure this one is safe.  If he ever recruits a CEO who is willing to discharge his functions, he will probably want to drive him out again.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">Where is the Deloitte audit of effectiveness and value for money in the Equality Authority?  Why is the Minister sitting on it and why will he not publish it?  Why will he not make it available to us?  Will he make it available to an bord snip nua before any decision is made?  For how long will the bilocation to which the Minister refers take place?  For how long will we have a gutted Equality Authority in Dublin and 16 people located in Roscrea?</p>

As the Taoiseach is aware, one of the fundamental issues is that the rule of law should apply to everybody and be seen to apply.  In what circumstances was a road haulier's licence allocated to a convicted drug trafficker, thus allowing him to transport drugs into and around this country?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the conditions that apply?  One of the fundamental requirements when obtaining a road haulier's licence is that the applicant be of good repute.</p>

As the Deputy knows, when this matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Transport just before last weekend, he asked that a review of the original file be sought from the Department's office in Loughrea.  That was issued yesterday evening.  Unfortunately, until such time as he completes his review and receives clarification from the Office of the Attorney General on the legal issues, he will not be in a position to comment further on the matter.  It is being examined by both the Minister and the commission, which has an independent remit.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">One of the things that is wrong in the House is that the Minister cannot comment on the matter.  Everybody else is doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">This appears to be a very strange case.  The normal circumstances that apply are such that when one applies for a road haulier's licence to the Department of Transport, the Department asks the Garda for what is essentially a character reference.  The applications are lodged by the applicants themselves.  They are not required to state everything about their lives.  The unusual point in the case in question is that when the Garda responded to the Department, it was able to point out a number of indiscretions and convictions for charges that applied in England, where the applicant was located.  It is clear the information was on the Garda file.  Why was no reference made to the fact that the applicant was convicted for the possession of cannabis and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment?  Why was this not in the reference for the Department of Transport, bearing in mind the stipulation that one be of good repute?</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Irrespective of the fact that the case is now being reviewed, the Taoiseach is only too well aware of the implications of the trafficking of vast quantities of drugs into this country and of gangland warfare, which arises as a consequence.  He is aware of the money that accrues from trafficking drugs, the havoc drugs cause among the young and of the tragedies that happen every day.  Given the factual information that is now in the public domain, which is on record here and in Britain, does the Taoiseach consider the applicant in question to be of good repute?</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Despite the fact that the Minister for Transport has asked the Attorney General to review the file, is it not entirely within the regulations of the Department of Transport and a Government principle that the law apply and be seen to apply to everybody, as Deputy Flanagan pointed out on numerous occasions?  Is it not possible for that law to be seen to apply across the board, with this licence revoked forthwith, and for the Taoiseach to state that convicted drug traffickers are not persons of good repute and are not entitled to road hauliers' licences?  The Taoiseach should say that now and let us get on with it.  It is a strange case.</p>

Obviously, he will look at that.  The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is looking at it and we must go through that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Clearly, if whatever arises out of it — whatever lessons are to be learned whereby a person who, it seems, was convicted of a drugs offence and was in a position to obtain a haulier's licence without that coming to the attention, presumably, of those who were administering the licensing regime in the Department — requires a change of arrangement so that this could not happen again, then obviously that is the principle of accountability we want to see.  We must get a clear view of the facts in terms of how this happened, who dealt with it, what issues arose and why certain matters came to their attention.</p>

Obviously, we want to get to the bottom of this quickly and ascertain what lessons are to be learned for the future and what policy or, indeed, legislative changes arise out of it so we can proceed to close off any gaps in information that may have arisen in this case which enabled this person to get a licence.

He will also have seen the opinion piece written by Professor Krugman in the <i>New York Times</i> this week in which he warns other countries against following the Irish Government’s example on the banks, which he described as an exercise in sacrificing the economy in order to save the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The Taoiseach will also have seen the opinion from 20 economists from a wide range of economic opinion and perspectives, and differing ideological standpoints, in which they argued that the game is up for the Irish banks and there is now an inevitability that the Government will have to nationalise them at least temporarily.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Does the Taoiseach agree with the assessment of the International Monetary Fund that our banking situation, in terms of the Government bailout, is now the worst in the developed world?  Does he consider it a damning verdict on his Government's handling of the banking situation?  Does he accept the point has been reached where it is necessary to nationalise the banks, at least temporarily, and what consideration has the Government given to that matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_135">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_211">On the first point Deputy Gilmore raised, as it happens the figures quoted in the newspapers this morning suggesting potential loss rates on foot of supports to the banking industry for Ireland do not appear in the IMF's final global financial stability report.  I understand there was a figure in an earlier draft which the IMF did not use in the end.  These figures should not be relied on as a measure of the likely cost for Ireland or any other country, although, from the point of view of the IMF, they may well be of use in calculating financial strains at a global level.  The particular figures appear to be based on more or less mechanical application of various modelling tools, with a heavy reliance on technical assumptions.  They do not represent the outcome of a specific examination of Irish banks' assets such has been carried out on behalf of the Financial Regulator by PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The principal reason the IMF approach gives a relatively high figure for Ireland is that our bank guarantee arrangement is broader ranging than that in other countries and our financial sector is larger relative to the economy.  Obviously, we are open at all times to discussion with international institutions about technical assumptions they apply to the Irish case, but in the current case we are far from convinced that there is a significant new or additional informational value in the figures presented from a national point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I understand from media reports that, following contacts with the UK authorities, figures on the UK in the final report have also been amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">On what Professor Krugman or any other eminent economist or number of economists might be saying about the banking system, we are very much of the view that we stand ready to assist in relation to financial institutions of systemic importance.  The question of impaired assets and how one deals with assets in this situation will be in line with the EU guidelines in these matters.  The tool kit available to us is the same as that available to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">As the Deputy will be aware, we have already provided support on the basis of getting a return for the taxpayers' money that we have invested in preference shares thus far.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that, in the event of there being any further requirement for us to invest in any banks of systemic importance, we would obviously look to ordinary shares in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It is also important to recognise the value that the market disciplines provide in terms of how we are viewed internationally in the banking system in the absence of a total nationalisation of the entire banking system in Ireland, and how that would be seen internationally.  We have already seen the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and a substantial shareholding taken by the Government — by the public — in Bank of Ireland and soon in Allied Irish Banks as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_217">That answer is a mixture of clutching at straws and denial.  No matter how the Taoiseach spins this, the IMF has used the same methodology in looking at the banking situation across all of the countries in the developed world and it has come to the conclusion that the Irish bailout will be the most expensive.  Clutching at straws by saying that this or that figure is out or was in an earlier draft is neither here nor there.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">We have moved from a situation where on 30 September the Taoiseach told us that the guarantee would avoid having to nationalise a bank or having to put money into any bank through a succession of attempts to deal with the banking situation.  A recapitalisation plan was announced before Christmas which did not happen.  A very short time prior to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the Minister was stating that there would not be a nationalisation.  Two banks have been recapitalised with €7 billion already and one of those banks now states that it needs an extra €1.5 billion.  On top of that, the Taoiseach has stated that the bad debts of the banks must now be all assembled in what is called the national asset management agency.  These are anything but national assets.  This is "an bord bail out" with a body being set up to assemble all of these bad debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Meanwhile, opinion from a range of sources is saying to the Taoiseach that the game is up and the banks in this country will have to be nationalised.  People have expressed differing opinions about the way in which the banks are to be nationalised — whether it should be a temporary nationalisation with them being resold at another stage or whether, for example, shares would be put into a trust and protected so that there could be some possibility of recovery down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It seems we are staring at the prospect of the nationalisation of the banks and I am trying to establish whether the Government will nationalise them.  Has the Government made a decision on this, or will it be one Government policy today and another in two or three weeks' time, as we have repeatedly found regarding the banks?</p>

            <p eId="para_278">Can the Taoiseach credibly say that policy decisions are being made in a better fashion since the Government destroyed the Freedom of Information Act in 2002 when it removed the opportunity for scrutiny of government decisions at the time, and shortly after, they were taken?  Does the Taoiseach still believe that the smothering of public discussion on many important decisions has improved decision-making?  Will he agree that we would be much better off if we had proper freedom of information disclosure in respect of decisions such as those on decentralisation?</p>
            <p eId="para_279">Decentralisation was a disastrous decision which was ill-thought at the time.  We would also be much better off if we had open discussions and information on the decisions concerning public sector benchmarking which were completely concealed.  We would be much better off if we had open information about the failures of regulation in the banking system which we still do not know enough about.</p>

            <p eId="para_282">If I might tell the Deputy, this is a familiar theme.  Questions relating to the Freedom of Information Act are in fact a matter for the line Minister, who happens to be the Minister for Finance.  The questions the Taoiseach was asked relate to the requests received by his Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_283">The Ceann Comhairle will understand there is much interest in how the Taoiseach of the time handled the decentralisation decision, a decision taken without any strategic plan or consultation with the line Departments affected or even the wider public.  The idea of freedom of information was to have a degree of openness in respect of decision-making but this has been smothered.  Does the Taoiseach agree with me that we need to rethink that so that better decisions are made in these crucial areas of public policy?</p>

            <p eId="para_285">The question is about the factual information to what requests under the Freedom of Information Acts my Department received.  It does not relate to a debate on the merits, or demerits as Deputy Bruton would see it, of the Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_286">During my tenure as Minister for Finance, I widened the number of agencies that came under the Act's remit.  Hundreds of State organisations are now required to work under the legislation, more than was the case when it was first enacted.  Any objective assessment has shown the type of information made available by the legislation compares more favourably than that released in other freedom of information regimes, including that of the United Kingdom.  If there are particular policy issues that Deputy Bruton has a problem with, I am sure he will find plenty of opportunities to air his views about them in other debates.  However, I cannot help him on this particular question.</p>

            <p eId="para_288">Does the Taoiseach believe we would be better off if we knew what advice was given to Ministers on, say, handling the property bubble or decentralisation?  Will he agree this would lead to a more realistic public debate?</p>

As I said, she has instanced bad practice.  What Department, if any, will take up on the Information Commissioner's raising of this matter in order to ensure best practice?  I expect the Department of the Taoiseach employs best practice.

The annual reporting mechanism by the Information Commissioner applies in respect of any specific complaints or ideas the Office of the Information Commissioner would have as to what would assist it in doing its job.

In the budget, there was only one reference to supporting jobs, which was an enterprise fund of €50 million in two years, at a time when the Government's document was forecasting 250,000 jobs would be lost over those two years.  The Taoiseach can work out the sums for himself.  This represents a stimulus package of approximately €200 for every job being lost.  Do we not need a completely separate arm to budgetary strategy that focuses on the investments in infrastructure we will need in future to get us out of this hole?

            <p eId="para_342">The whole question of budgetary policy was dealt with not only in regard to Cabinet committees but Cabinet meetings also.  The regaining of competitiveness, which deals with what is happening in the private sector in regard to people having to take less in wages and take-home pay and the effort to reduce costs in a very difficult market environment, is an important contribution towards trying to maintain the maximum number of jobs in what is one of the most difficult years this economy has ever experienced.  The point, which I believe is accepted, is that without seeking to bring order to the public finances, the prospect of economic recovery is postponed.  While it is a difficult year and next year will also be difficult, it is not contended by any serious commentator or observer of the economy or the economic events in Ireland that this is an issue that can be sidestepped.</p>
            <p eId="para_343">The issue for us, therefore, has been our contribution towards reducing the rate of current expenditure, targeting capital expenditure as a contribution towards economic activity, seeking to assist in every way we can, not just by reason of an equalisation fund but also with regard to the question of activation measures to try to help the people who unfortunately have been losing their jobs, similar to what has been happening in other economies in the developing world.</p>
            <p eId="para_344">We need to see in what way we can assist at a time when the public finances are very scarce.  We are trying to maintain service levels in key areas of health and education which will require further reforms.  We will require further support in this House for reforms on the basis that everyone would acknowledge that the level of resources that will become available to the Exchequer will be such that without reforms we put at risk the service levels we are tying to protect.</p>

            <p eId="para_345">Last Friday I was in Donegal where businesspeople were in despair at the budget.  There is a sense that nothing was done about the VAT issues to give them relief and that there was no investment stimulus.  These are people trying to hang on in the face of a very tough climate.  The Taoiseach needs to think again about what the Government is going to do about job protection and job stimulus in this very difficult time.  It is all very well to talk about balancing the books and raising taxes to fill the hole, but there needs to be another dimension to this strategy, which was lacking in the budget.  While 30 May is a long time away, the committee needs to knuckle down to that issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_346">I point out to the Deputy that the Cabinet meets every week.  It is not a question of waiting for a committee meeting to decide what we do on economic policy or respond to economic issues.  I can assure him that economic issues dominate any Cabinet meeting because of the scale of the task that faces us and the number of problems that are arising.  Let us get away from the idea that a committee meets on 21 May and nothing happens in the meantime.  That is not the real world.</p>
            <p eId="para_347">Despite the very tight economic situation in which we find ourselves, the Government is still committed to a 5% capital investment programme this year.  It does not make up for the reduction in activity in the private sector <i>in toto</i>, but it is a serious commitment by Government at a time of great scarcity of resources and when the taxation base has been reduced by 33% in a very short period of time.  With respect, the idea that was being contended by the Deputy’s party leader that we could bring forward a recovery strategy in the absence of any change in the income tax system was bereft of any credibility and was seen as such by the public.</p>

Has the frequency of meetings of the Cabinet committees increased over the past six, ten or 12 months as full Cabinet meetings have clearly increased in response to the ever-deepening economic crisis we face?  In the context of what I can only regard as the very savage cutbacks in education, which are especially hitting children of what might be described as our new communities and making integration and social inclusion even more difficult, have the issues of the capping of the numbers of language support teachers at two, the increase in class sizes, the cutting of special needs supports and the cutting of book grants been addressed at the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, children and integration, given that they have a particular impact on the children of new community families within our wider community?</p>

            <p eId="para_352">As the Ceann Comhairle said, these are matters for Cabinet alone.  To be helpful to the Deputy, the particular Cabinet committee he mentioned meets as necessary and will continue to do so.  New institutional structures are in place, such as the integrated offices for children, older persons, and mental health and disability.  It means these crosscutting responsibilities are enabling Ministers of State in those offices to do the work that normally in the past would have been left to a Cabinet committee to consider at a time when all these responsibilities were strictly departmental rather than interdepartmental.  We can consider what has been happening in the areas of disability and mental health, drugs strategy and how it is interacting with the provision of local services with the Office of the Minister for Children.  It has proven to be a successful innovation in developing a greater degree of cross-departmental and buy-in as one considers how to deal with issues that affect these subjects far more holistically than was the case in the past when various Departments had varying responsibilities in respect of a category of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_353">It lines up with the social partnership agreement where we consider the lifecycle approach and try to bring together a policy on children, young working families, disabilities and the elderly.  If one likes, we have given expression departmentally to that lifecycle approach.  In my experience and in my attendance in whatever capacity since they were instigated, I find it a far better and more worthwhile means of trying to pull together whatever are the policy issues and how one can seek developments in various areas in the most cost-efficient way possible.  For that reason the requirement of a Cabinet committee agenda arising in that particular area has been superseded by these crosscutting Departments, with Ministers of State with specific responsibilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, also has the benefit of attending Cabinet meetings on a weekly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_354">There have been occasions when Ministers of State with these crosscutting responsibilities have attended the particular part of a Cabinet meeting where issues arising out of their responsibilities have been discussed or where a policy matter was being considered or decided upon.  That has been a worthwhile innovation and is something I would commend.  It is continuing in the context of the new Minister of State arrangements that will be announced shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_355">There is a Cabinet meeting every week, as the Deputy knows, and more if necessary, depending on the workload or what is happening.  Cabinet committees meet as required.  Where interdepartmental and inter-ministerial discussion on an issue would be helpful it is called on that basis.  That is generally the methodology that is used.</p>

            <p eId="para_356">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I seek clarification.  If I have missed out on a change of Cabinet committee title then it is my failure.  I was genuinely of the view that heretofore we had been referring to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs.  At what point was this changed?  Are the issues regarding drugs being addressed in a different and newly designated committee?  At the outset of a new Dáil term, let us say, there could be a reshuffle of the portfolios under different Ministers, which happens from time to time.  Has there been a shuffle of responsibility by Cabinet committee and is that what this reflects?  Could the Taoiseach shed some light on the matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_357">Regarding the absence of any public profile, I appreciate that the Cabinet meets as frequently as required and certainly once a week.  However, we have no notion of the function, remit or activity of Cabinet committees.  While the Ceann Comhairle correctly cautioned me earlier on the confidentiality aspect, would the Taoiseach share his view of this matter?  Surely it would be beneficial to an appreciation of the work that has been undertaken by all involved for us to have a sense of the issues being addressed, if not the detail, which were taking up the Taoiseach's time.</p>

            <p eId="para_360">The holding of Cabinet committees is an internal matter for the Cabinet.  As I said, no decisions are taken at Cabinet committees.  The whole idea is to bring to fruition various policy issues and debates and to come to Cabinet with a position that is, usually, agreed by the various Ministers, rather than have all of that argument and discussion at the Cabinet level.  There might be a specialised issue involving two or three Ministers that needs to be dealt with at that level by the Ministers and their Civil Service advisers and whatever.  Such committees are really just a methodology of getting through the agenda in a more efficient way rather than being in plenary session all the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_365">I will remember that.  The work done at Cabinet committees is just part of the wider ministerial work, while Cabinet meetings are where the decisions are made.  Cabinet committees have a role, but it is not necessary that they be structured on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.  Sometimes issues arise where a series of meetings is required at that level before the issue is brought to Cabinet and dealt with so we can move on.  We may also very well need to have a number of meetings of another committee because another issue that has arisen requires some more intensive cross-departmental consideration.  People should not assume the number of meetings equates with their effect on a particular Cabinet committee.  The Cabinet committee deals with an issue as it arises.  Some of these committees are working very well.  Our current ministerial arrangements have mitigated against the need for committee meetings and more action oriented ministerially directed activity has improved for those sectors and constituencies in respect of the offices we have set up.</p>

I thank the Taoiseach for explaining to the House the role of these committees in reconciling what may appear to be conflicting policy objectives by Government and individual Departments.  Which of the committees is addressing the matters related to banking?</p>
            <p eId="para_367">Which committee, for example, would have considered the proposal to establish "an bord bail out", or NAMA as it is officially known?  Which committee would have considered the apparent conflict of Government objectives with regard to the establishment of that agency and the issue, for example, of staffing?  What is the anticipated complement of staff and how is it proposed to recruit those staff?  Is it intended to have a recruitment process or is it intended to transfer them from other areas of Government activity?  How is it proposed to reconcile the establishment of an agency which appears to require a large number of staff in circumstances where there is a total and rigid embargo on recruitment in the public sector?</p>

            <p eId="para_372">The Cabinet deals with all economic issues, including banking, on an ongoing basis.  Obviously, some meetings would take place that would not be Cabinet committee meetings, for example, between myself and the Minister for Finance or between myself, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers or people attending from the Central Bank.  This depends on the issue of the day or the issue requiring discussion.  To put it another way, we do not have to have a committee in order to have a meeting.  However, the normal decisions on banking are taken in accordance with Government procedure, through memos for Government being provided, circulated, discussed and decided upon.  Therefore, there is no change in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_373">NAMA is being set up under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which has the ability to recruit people within its arrangements and in which it has been quite successful.  As we know, this is a mammoth task that has been undertaken.  A detailed implementation plan will now be devised by the NTMA for the purpose of setting up this asset management agency.  I envisage an interim chief executive and interim board will be established as soon as possible and the Minister for Finance will bring proposals to Cabinet in that regard.  The need to set out an implementation plan and take the practical steps for setting up the agency and the question of the staffing complement it will require will be a matter of consideration by the board, the Minister and the interim executive appointed — the NTMA experience in this area will be vital.  They will also decide the question of the extent of oversight and decision-making with regard to assets transferred under the control of NAMA.  Who will do the monitoring of that work is a matter for decision by NAMA itself.  These issues will be decided in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_374">What we see here, arising from the budget, is a policy statement which confirms, both at home and abroad, the overall method to be adopted by Government to deal with the issue of how to isolate these impaired assets and deal with them in the longer term by recovering their full value to the greatest extent possible, protecting the interests of the taxpayer and setting up an agency that will be independent, transparent and in line with EU guidelines in respect of impaired assets.  These are the sort of considerations that will now be undertaken by the Minister for Finance as he comes to Cabinet for the consideration of an interim board and the setting up of an executive.</p>

            <p eId="para_375">Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the NTMA is exempt from the provisions of the recruitment embargo?  What is the anticipated level of staffing required by NAMA?  I think, for example, of the work a local authority must do if it wants to buy back a council house.  It must send out a valuer and, probably, an architect to check its condition.  There is a considerable amount of administrative work involved in the process also and this involves the council's own finance department.  We must multiply that when considering the work involved in sending people out to look at half-finished housing estates, office blocks, hotels and fields.  There is also work to be done sending people abroad to see the properties there that must be bought up.  They must be valued and an opinion on them must be got.  What happens if NAMA is acquiring one of these properties and the builder-supplier appears out of the woodwork to say he is owed money by the developer and lodges a challenge to the purchase or makes some attempt to get money back?  What assessment has been made as to the total number of staff required by this agency?    As regards the public sector recruitment embargo, will the NTMA have a free hand in staffing to whatever level is required to do what will clearly be an extensive job?</p>

            <p eId="para_379">In the first instance, we have to establish an interim board and an interim executive and allow them the time to devise the implementation plan that is necessary.  We have set the policy direction.  A lot of work must now be undertaken to get it up and running in a pragmatic way, to work thereafter on the legal arrangements that will have to be put in place and debated in the House and, in the coming months, to enable all of that to start to take shape.  It is a mammoth task, but it is important to point out that the first pragmatic step is to allow the interim board and the appointed executives to set out a detailed implementation plan.  We can see the path forward on that basis.</p>

In areas of the health service, the contracts of caring staff cannot be renewed.  Services will need to be curtailed as a result.  The Government has decided on an absolute embargo on recruitment, promotion, acting up and the renewal of short-term contracts because of the reasons explained to the House by the Taoiseach previously.  Against this backdrop, it is strange that the Government would not have given some consideration to or have a handle on what will be the likely staffing requirement of the new agency.  I am surprised to hear that.  Apparently, the issue has been left to the NTMA in a vague way.</p>

Against this backdrop and if the Taoiseach is discussing establishing an interim board, will it have the authority to commit taxpayers' money without the Dáil having any say in the framework within which it will operate?  The figures are of a stunning magnitude.  Before we set up interim boards with commitments to act on behalf of the taxpayer, the people who represent the taxpayer have rights to some idea of the framework and to an opportunity to insert whatever protections for the taxpayer that the House considers are appropriate as the institution evolves.</p>

It is only when the heads of the Bill are prepared and brought to Cabinet that we will be able to indicate how soon this will be legislated for.  It is a priority in the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I also wish to announce for the information of the Dáil that following my acceptance of the resignations, the Government today, on my nomination, appointed the following to be Ministers of State: Deputy Pat Carey to be Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip; Deputy Barry Andrews to be Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for children and young people; Deputy Dick Roche to be Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs; Deputy Trevor Sargent to be Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Health and Children with special responsibility for food, horticulture and food safety; Deputy Tony Killeen to be Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for forestry, fisheries and the marine; Deputy Conor Lenihan to be Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with special responsibility for science, technology, innovation, the information society and natural resources; Deputy Seán Haughey to be Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for lifelong learning and school transport; Deputy Billy Kelleher to be Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for trade and commerce; Deputy John Moloney to be Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health; Deputy Michael Finneran to be Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special responsibility for housing and local services; Deputy John Curran to be Minister of State at the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for integration and community affairs; Deputy Peter Power to be Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for overseas development; Deputy Martin Mansergh to be Minister of State at the Departments of Finance, including special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, and Arts, Sport and Tourism with special responsibility for the arts; Deputy Áine Brady to be Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special responsibility for older people and health promotion; and Deputy Dara Calleary to be Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">Briefly, I make no secret of the fact that my party believes the Taoiseach should have gone further both in reducing the numbers and in the remuneration of the offices.  Notwithstanding that, I congratulate the new appointees in particular, namely, Deputies Áine Brady and Dara Calleary.  The Cabinet still will be "Kitted" out as although one Deputy Kitt has departed, another Deputy Kitt has entered as a replacement, which I suppose is a fair exchange.  I commiserate with those who have lost their positions, namely, Deputies Jimmy Devins, Seán Power, Micheál Kitt, Máire Hoctor, John McGuinness, Noel Ahern and Mary Wallace.  They have put in a great effort in their roles and I am sure the House will commiserate with them on their loss of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">On a lighter note, this reminds me of when I was made a Minister of State, when the late John Boland described me as being appointed third mate on the <i>Titanic</i>.  In this case there are 15 mates, which is enough to fill an entire lifeboat.  That said, I wish them well in these troubled times.  I hope their work will be crowned with success and will make a difference, not only to those appointed today but to the people, who Members seek to serve.</p>

It is a proud day for them and I wholeheartedly congratulate them.  I also congratulate all the Ministers of State who survived and commiserate with those who were not reappointed.  While it is a disappointing day for them, to some extent that is the way of politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The only point I will make about the appointments is that the country needs somewhat more profound political change than simply making some changes in the office of Ministers of State.  However, that probably is for lá eile.</p>

I wish them both the very best in their new positions.  However, the critical news that all Members await is not the appointment of new Ministers of State or the reappointment of others.  It pertains to a required new policy direction that will take on board many of the sound arguments that have been presented by Opposition parties in this House in recent months and  which are relevant to the serious economic crisis in which we find ourselves.  The cutting of the number of Ministers of State and the shuffling of personnel is not an answer.  Although I hope it will prove to be otherwise, many will consider this to be nothing more than part of a smokescreen placed over the Government's failure to address the real issues of the retention of jobs and the creation of new job opportunities, which are the two critical elements that have been missing from the Government's entire approach.

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_428">I wish to ask two questions on the Order of Business.  First, I seek clarification from the Taoiseach on the issue of the National Asset Management Agency.  There have been newspaper reports that although this is a matter of priority, it is unlikely that Members will see the legislation until October.  However, the Taoiseach indicated recently that an interim board would be appointed fairly quickly.  Members need to know under what legal authority it will be working and what role the Dáil will play in establishing and limiting that legal authority to protect taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The second question pertains to legislation to implement decisions that were announced in the budget relating to Members' pay and conditions.  These announcements have created enormous confusion in people's minds as to what exactly the Government intends and how it expects to implement them.  I ask the Taoiseach to set out for the House the exact position in respect of the legislation that will be implemented.  It is not acceptable for Ministers, who earn twice the pay of most Deputies, to lecture people about what they should and should not do when the Government has the legal authority to implement the changes it states are desirable.  Clarification is required in this regard and it is only fair to everyone to have certainty as to the way in which we will proceed. While the House will support reasonable measures introduced by the Government, certainty is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">Regarding the timetable for legislation, it is a priority for the Government.  The purpose of the legislation is to establish and govern the operation of the NAMA.  We hope to introduce it in the summer session.  Preparation of the legislation for the NAMA management structures and operating procedures will be initiated immediately and will run in parallel.  The Government will explore the possibility of establishing the NAMA on an interim basis to undertake the initial scoping, valuation and recruitment work required.  Provision for the appointment of the chairperson and chief executive officer and the constitution of the board will be addressed in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Regarding the other matter, we have outlined that the Government intends to suspend the payment of ministerial pensions to sitting Deputies and Senators in the next Oireachtas.  Having regard to the existing legal entitlements, the Government will engage in a consultation process with a view to introducing a proportionate reduction in the rate of pension payable to former Ministers sitting in the current Oireachtas, having regard to the pressure on the public purse and the need for public representatives to set an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Increments are being frozen from budget day.  In the next Oireachtas, the question of not going ahead with them in the future will be dealt with in legislation, with a view to ensuring that the pensionability aspect of those increments is taken into account.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">I submitted a standard question to the Taoiseach for oral reply on the constitutional referenda that the Government plans to hold for the remainder of 2009.  It has been answered many times in the past, on 13 occasions since 2005.  On this occasion it was transferred by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Why is the Taoiseach transferring to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Foreign Affairs a general question on the holding of constitutional referenda, which has previously been answered by him and his predecessors?</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I refer to a statement made by the Government Chief Whip on 3 February in the House in response to a Labour Party motion that sought to move the writ for the Dublin South by-election.  In response to the motion, the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Carey, stated that the Government intended to run the by-election for Dublin South on the same day as the local and European Parliament elections.  Is that still the Government's intention?  If it is, when will the Government introduce the motion to the House to move the writ for the Dublin South by-election?</p>

I have no problem answering the question in any event.</p>

The period of time within which the writ can be moved for the holding of that by-election on 5 June is very narrow.  There is a short timeframe.  Will the Government proceed on that basis?  Will the by-election for Dublin South be on 5 June?  While answering that, the Taoiseach can tell us the Government's intention with regard to the Dublin Central by-election.</p>

This was subject to great criticism when the current Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was in Opposition.

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_561">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_562">This Bill will give legislative effect to the social welfare elements of the supplementary budget introduced earlier this month.  In the context of the current economic circumstances, it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure to restore order and stability in the public finances.  In light of extremely difficult decisions having to be made in respect of the entire range of Government expenditures, social welfare was prioritised in the supplementary budget.  Almost €21.3 billion is being provided for welfare services in 2009.  This represents an increase of €1.7 billion, or 8.7%, on the amount originally provided for this year in the previous budget and is €3.6 billion, or approximately 20%, higher than the actual amount spent in 2008.  This additional expenditure arises mainly as a result of increases in unemployment, with the expected average live register figure for 2009 having been adjusted upwards, unfortunately, from 290,000 to 440,000 between the October and April budgets.  The extra cost in this regard will be €1.97 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Significant additional expenditure also arises as a result of the cost of the improvements announced in the October budget, which provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in basic social welfare payment rates.  At that point, the expected rate of inflation for 2009 was 2.5%.  This forecast has, however, not been realised.  Instead, deflation of almost 4% is now anticipated.  With social welfare recipients receiving between 3% and 3.8% more in their weekly payments and with prices having fallen in recent months, their living standards, therefore, have been protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">In the aftermath of this month's budget, total gross spending on social welfare is expected to account for 29% of gross total Government expenditure in 2009.  Leaving aside borrowing, the social welfare expenditure provided in the budget is expected to account for 60% of the Exchequer's anticipated current revenue from tax and other sources.  At a time when Government expenditure must be controlled as much as possible, this significant investment in social welfare is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to protecting the vulnerable and helping those who rely on the State for their basic income.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The Bill provides for certain amendments to the social welfare code, as announced in the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement of 7 April 2009.  I wish to detail the main changes to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The Bill provides for the changes in the rent supplement scheme that were announced in the supplementary budget.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances — for example, when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford his or her rent.  There are currently almost 84,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 40% since the end of December 2007.  The supplementary budget provides for a net increase of €29 million in rent supplement.  This consists of an increase of €77 million for additional claims arising from the increase in the live register and a saving of €48 million in 2009 — €75 million in 2010 — as a result of the a number of measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">From the end of this month rent supplement will be restricted to individuals who have been existing tenants for six months.  Individuals who have not been tenants for six months or who are forming new households must have been placed on a local authority housing list following a full housing assessment before they will become eligible for a rent supplement payment.  These measures will apply to all new applicants for rent supplement.  Exemptions will apply where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless or where he or she has been already identified by a housing authority as having a housing need, where the person is a tenant of a voluntary housing body — capital assistance scheme tenants — or where he or she is aged over 65 or is in receipt of a disability-type payment.  These exemptions will ensure that young people coming out of residential care settings, such as foster homes, will be protected.  Rent supplement will continue to provide support where housing authorities are not in a position to respond within a reasonable timeframe and where a person is at risk of experiencing homelessness or hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The second change being made to the rent supplement is an increase in the minimum contribution that individuals and families make towards their rent.  This is being increased by €6 to €24 from 1 June 2009, which will align the rent supplement more closely with the rents that local authority tenants are obliged to pay.  In Dublin city, these tenants must pay a minimum of €25.80 per week and the average is approximately €59 per week.  One of the reported impediments to the transfer of rent supplement claimants to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is the significant difference between the contribution which is required of the tenant under the rent supplement scheme and the contribution which they are required to pay through the differential rent scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The third rent supplement change is a reduction in the maximum level of rent supplement payable by the State in respect of all new tenancies or on renewals of tenancies.  The limits will be reduced by 6% to 7% on average, ranging up to 10%, depending on the geographical area and household size and by reference to an analysis of rent supplement and the Private Residential Tenancies Board rent data, as well as downward trends in private rents as published by the Central Statistics Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">As Deputies will be aware, trends in the private rent sector indicate that rents have fallen considerably during the past 12 months.  This is evident from data available from the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the Daft property website.  I am sure Members will agree it is vital that taxpayers' money should not be used to pay landlords inflated rental prices.  This change will help to ensure that this will not be the case in respect of new rent supplement tenancies.  However, with more than €490 million being spent by the State on the rent supplement, we need to make sure that landlords of existing tenants do not charge too much.  To this end, from 1 June 2009 the rent supplements for all existing tenancies will be reduced by €6 to reflect their additional contribution towards their rent and by a further 8% to reflect the impact of the new rent supplement limits.  While tenants are contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, we expect landlords to decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.  I urge all Deputies to support us in this and help us to send a clear message to landlords that tenants supported by the State will not be overcharged.  On a positive note, agreement has been reached with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 1,000 transfers from rent supplement to the longer-term rental accommodation scheme in 2009.  This will bring the total number of such transfers to 9,000 this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The next area where legislative changes are required on foot of the budget is the early child care supplement.  The Government appreciates that the supplement has been a significant support to families with young children and we were glad to have been able to introduce it when funding allowed in 2006.  However, in the current economic climate, very difficult decisions had to be made in the budget and there were no easy options in reducing expenditure.  The early child care supplement cost €480 million in 2008.  We need to achieve better results with fewer resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">In the supplementary budget, it was announced that the monthly ECS payment will be halved to €41.50 per child from 1 May 2009 and that it will be abolished in full at the end of 2009.  It will be replaced in January 2010 with a free pre-school year of early childhood care and education for all children between the ages of three years three months and four years six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The recent report of the National Competitiveness Council on education and training stated that "pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education, as it leads to improvements in students' skills levels, motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raises the private and social returns from all future investments in their education".</p>

Children enrolled in full or part-time child care services will receive free pre-school provision of two hours and 15 minutes per day, five days a week over a 50 week period.  This equates to a weekly capitation grant to the service of €48.50, with parents paying for their child care net of this amount.

          <p eId="para_585">To introduce the scheme as quickly as possible and maximise the number of children and their parents who will benefit from the outset, the Government did not propose to wait until the school year beginning September 2010 but to introduce the scheme from January 2010.  From September 2010, the pre-school year will run from September of each year in line with the school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">All children aged between three years three months and four years six months at 1 September each year will be eligible and parents who wish to avail of the scheme can enrol their children with the available participating service of their choice.  Children entering the scheme in January 2010 will be eligible if they are aged between three years and seven months and four years and ten months at 1 January 2010.  Parents should have regard to the enrolment policies of their local primary schools in making decisions regarding the age that their children should avail of the pre-school year.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">The Social Welfare Bill also provides for changes to the jobseeker's allowance which are designed to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and avoid becoming welfare dependent from a young age.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The rate of jobseeker's allowance that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 is being reduced from €204.30 per week to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009.  When a person on the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance reaches the age of 20, if he or she still qualifies for the allowance, he or she will be entitled to the full adult rate.  The full adult rate of the relevant scheme will be paid to 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a full-time Youthreach course for young early school leavers or a full-time course in a senior Traveller training centre or qualify for the back to education allowance for pursuing a full-time second level course or post-leaving certificate course.  To qualify for the back to education allowance, they must have been out of formal education for at least two years and been in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for at least three months; or participate in a full-time FÁS training course.  They can also participate on a PLC course or third level course on the same basis as any other young person and may qualify for a third level grant.  This measure also applies to new claimants of supplementary welfare allowance who are under 20 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The numbers affected will be small at first as it will only affect new applicants from the first week in May.  The numbers affected will rise on a weekly basis.  Based on current figures, and an expected overall live register average for 2009 of 440,000, we expect a weekly average of 5,000 18 and 19 year olds to be affected by this change in 2009 and a weekly average of 9,000 to be affected by it in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">These changes have the potential to generate savings of €12 million in 2009 and €26 million in 2010.  If take up of the education and training opportunities is high, fewer savings will be achieved in the short term but the long-term savings generated by helping young people to avoid welfare dependency would be expected to be significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The qualified adult rate for a spouse or partner payable in these cases will also be reduced to €100 per week.  This will mean that a couple, where the primary payment is to the 18 and 19 year old, will get a total of €200 per week, down from €339.90.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It is important to note that the following people will not be affected: existing claimants, young people with dependent children, those who qualify for the jobseeker's benefit and people transferring to jobseeker's allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or those transferring from the disability allowance directly to jobseeker's allowance, thereby avoiding their being faced with a large income drop.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Also, where an existing jobseeker's allowance claimant under age 20 being paid €204.30 gets a job and leaves jobseeker's allowance, but loses that job and ends up back on jobseeker's allowance within 12 months, he will get €204.30, rather than €100 a week.  If this was not done, there would be little incentive for those currently on jobseeker's allowance to take up offers of work.  I am conscious that 18 and 19 year olds leaving the care of the Health Service Executive might be particularly vulnerable to these reductions in the rate of jobseeker's allowance and I propose to make an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that the additional needs of this group are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The rationale for this change is straightforward.  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at 18 years of age without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency from an early age.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the next few years.  If they do not improve their skills, they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.  They are considered to be at a greater risk of having difficulty securing a job than older jobseekers who might have low skills but at least have some work experience.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide 18 and 19 year old jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment that pays more than €100 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The fact that 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a FÁS or similar training or education course will get the full rate of the relevant payment, for example, the FÁS training allowance, community employment rate or back to education allowance, instead of €100 on jobseeker's allowance should be a major incentive for such participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Another reason for making this change is the experience we have of a recent pilot initiative.  FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are currently running a pilot exercise in Clondalkin and Letterkenny for all 18 and 19 year olds who wish to sign on the live register for the first time.  Instead of getting jobseeker's allowance, they will be immediately placed on a six-week programme designed to improve their chances of securing employment, in return for which they receive the normal FÁS training allowance, which is slightly more than jobseeker's allowance.  Failure to attend means they receive no payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Initial feedback showed that many candidates did not wish to participate, preferring to get almost the same money without having to attend a course, and consequently they were sometimes disruptive and difficult to manage.  This obstacle of a lack of a substantial financial incentive is now being addressed with the introduction of the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance for those under 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">It is also questionable that 18 and 19 year olds without child dependants need an income of €204.30 per week and the current income differential between young jobseekers and young third level students can be considered to be unjustifiable.  The maximum amount of third level grant, including the special top-up grant, paid to young people from the poorest families whose family home is near their college is just €2,680.   The maximum amount of third level grant, including the special top-up grant, paid to young people from the poorest families whose family home is near their college is just €2,680.  If such young people have to live away from home to go to college, the maximum they can get is €6,690.  The current rate of jobseeker's assistance which is currently paid to 18 and 19 year olds amounts to €10,624 per annum, while the reduced rate of €100 per week amounts to €5,200 per annum, which is still almost twice the third level grant rate paid to young people from the poorest families whose family home is near their college.  Overall, I believe this change will incentivise 18 and 19 year olds to take up education and training opportunities and this will leave them in a much better position in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">As Deputies will be aware, the budget contained a major focus on helping people to stay in employment and to get back to work, with initiatives such as a €100 million enterprise stabilisation fund, a pilot training scheme for workers on a three day week and increased training places both through FÁS and in the education sector.  These will be enhanced by improvements in the welfare supports.  The back to education allowance scheme allows jobseekers who qualify for it to return to education and maintain their welfare payment.  The number of recipients of the allowance has increased significantly in recent years — from 5,247 in 2004 to 7,952 in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Government is determined to maximise the potential of this scheme, so improvements provided for in this Bill are outlined as follows.  Jobseekers who have been out of formal education for at least two years will now be able to access the second level back to education allowance, BTEA, once they have been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit for at least three months.  That is down from six months.  Earlier access is also being provided to the BTEA third level scheme.  Currently, there is a general requirement that a person be receiving a jobseeker's payment for 12 months before he or she can access the scheme.  They can access it at nine months if this is recommended by a FÁS employment services officer.  This is now being extended so that they will also be able to access it at nine months if this is recommended by one of the facilitators of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the live register, the changing profile of jobseekers generally and the current employment situation, it has been decided to refocus the existing resources from the back to work schemes on helping people into self-employment.  The intention is to support enterprises that will, in due course, create further employment opportunities.  To this end, the employee strand of the back to work allowance will be closed to new applicants and the duration of the enterprise scheme will now be up to two years, as distinct from four years.  These resources will be used to support significant improvements in the back to work enterprise allowance, BTWEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Currently, to qualify for BTWEA a person must be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for 24 months.  Access will now be available much earlier under two distinct BTWEA schemes.  First, people who are entitled to jobseeker's benefit and have been awarded statutory redundancy or have been employees paying full rate PRSI contributions for at least two years prior to their claim to jobseeker's benefit can access a shorter back to work enterprise allowance scheme immediately.  This new scheme will be payable for the duration of their jobseeker's benefit entitlement while they are establishing their enterprise, for example, for a maximum of either nine or 12 months.  The key feature is that they can access it immediately.  Second, access to the general BTWEA scheme is also being improved.  It will now be possible to access the BTWEA at 12 months, instead of 24 months, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Further flexibilities are also being introduced into the scheme, including allowing a person who has previously availed of the BTWEA scheme and exhausted his or her entitlement to participate a second time after a period of at least five years has elapsed.  The overall purpose of the new arrangements is to financially assist those on the live register to set up a business almost immediately when they become unemployed, thereby ensuring that their knowledge, skills and expertise are fully utilised at an early stage and thereby promoting enterprise and employment in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">In addition to the areas already outlined, the Bill also provides for changes in PRSI and other areas.  I will outline the main provisions.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for adjustments to PRSI as announced in the budget, increasing the earnings ceiling applicable to employees and optional contributors from €52,000 to €75,036 per annum.  Section 5 provides for an amendment to customer activation and information profiling for jobseeker's benefit.  It also provides for a new short-term support scheme under the back to work enterprise allowance scheme for a person who qualifies for jobseeker's benefit or who qualifies for statutory redundancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Section 6 provides for an amendment to customer activation and information profiling for jobseeker's allowance.  It also provides for an amendment to the rate of jobseeker's allowance payable to a person aged 18 and 19 years where that person does not have a qualified child.  This section also provides for a proportional adjustment in respect of the amount payable to a person in this category in respect of his or her qualified adult.  Section 7 provides for an amendment to the provisions governing supplementary allowance and rent supplement by providing for a revised rate of payment to persons under the age of 20 years, where that person does not have a qualified child, and incorporating in primary legislation circumstances in which the supplement may be payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Section 8 provides for amendments to the early child care supplement by reducing the annual amount of the payment to €498 and a consequent reduction in the monthly rate to €41.50 from 1 May.  This section further provides for the abolition of the supplement from 1 January 2010.  Section 9 provides for the making of regulations setting out the information to be provided by claimants when making a claim for benefit.  Section 10 provides for an amendment to the domiciliary care allowance scheme to facilitate payment of up to six months arrears in the case of a late claim.  This is in line with recent practice when the scheme was administered by the Health Service Executive.  This scheme was transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in April 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Section 11 provides for revised rates of payment for jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance as provided for in sections 6 and 7.  Section 12 amends the Health Contributions Act 1979, by providing for an increase in the rate of the contribution and lowering the earnings threshold.  This section also provides for the aggregation of earnings, emoluments and income for the purpose of calculation of contribution and adjustment to take account of aggregate calculations.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Given the very short timescale involved in bringing this Bill to the House, there are a number of areas where legislative changes are considered necessary but which could not be finalised in time to be included in the Bill as initially presented to the House.  I will, therefore, table several amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  First, I am very conscious of the impact the current global recession is having on the value of Irish pension funds.  It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefits pension schemes are in deficit.  This is presenting trustees of pension schemes with significant challenges in their efforts to optimise the benefits for pension scheme members.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Deputies will be aware that the Government put a number of measures in place last December to ease the funding pressures on these schemes.  While these measures were helpful in the short term, I wish to signal my intention to bring forward a number of further measures which will support the job of the trustees of these schemes in meeting the challenges that confront them and provide greater flexibility and regulatory support to improve the affordability and viability of defined benefit pension schemes.  I will also be amending the National Treasury Management Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I have already mentioned that I propose to introduce an amendment to protect 18 and 19 year olds leaving the care of the Health Service Executive to ensure that their additional needs can be met.  I will also be making a technical amendment to section 7 dealing with the supplementary welfare allowance.  It may also be necessary to make some technical amendments to section 12 dealing with amendments to the Health Contributions Act.  I will also be introducing an amendment to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to provide for the changes announced in the supplementary budget regarding the public service pension levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Chun críoch, the main changes provided for in this Bill relate to improvements in the back to education and back to work schemes, measures designed to generate savings in respect of the rent supplement and the early child care supplement and an increase in the PRSI ceiling.  The Bill will also provide a legislative basis for the changes being made to the jobseeker's allowance to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to avoid them becoming welfare dependent from a young age.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It is important for each of the savings measures to be considered in the context of the overall economic situation and the need for immediate action to reduce the major gap between public income and expenditure.  It is also important to note that while the budget included measures designed to reduce expenditure on certain welfare schemes by €300 million in 2009, provision has been made for an overall increase of 20% in the welfare budget next year — bringing it to almost €21.3 billion.  This Bill is necessary to implement some of the changes announced on budget day, while other changes do not require legislation.  In deciding on where to achieve savings in welfare expenditure, there were no easy options but, with both borrowing and taxes having to increase to pay the rising welfare bill next year, choices had to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The harsh reality is that if some cuts were not made now, much tougher ones would have to be made later.  It is important that all of us as public representatives are up-front with the people about the stark choices that are required at this time.  The changes in this Bill are necessary and some of them are very positive and have an incentivising effect.  I hope we can have an informed debate about them over the course of the next two days.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_616">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have grave difficulty accepting many of the proposed changes and I disagree with the conclusions arrived at by the Minister in her final remarks.  I hope we have an informed debate but I cannot see much room for agreement on many of the issues.  Accordingly, Fine Gael will vote against the Social Welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Based on what the Minister said, the Government is probably taking comfort from the fact that legislation is not necessary to abolish the Christmas bonus, which is probably one of the reasons that decision was taken.  It is clear that Government backbenchers and local authority candidates, rather than the people in need, were to the fore in the Government's thinking when it was considering social welfare cuts.   The Government made a clear decision to cut something that would not require legislation and thus would not force Fianna Fáil TDs to vote on the issue.  I welcome the fact that we will have an opportunity to discuss the issue in this House later today and tomorrow on Private Members' time.  That will afford an opportunity to all Members of the House to make it clear to the public where they stand on the removal of the Christmas bonus from the most vulnerable people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">We in Fine Gael have long sought changes in the back to work enterprise allowance, as the method by which it currently operates is a disincentive to employment and entrepreneurship and forces people to remain on the live register.  Everyone in this House can give the Minister many examples of people who have come to them who were ineligible for the allowance, despite having the ideas, determination and skills to create a job for themselves and to potentially create jobs for other people once they are set up in business.  However, the changes in the Social Welfare Bill, as announced in the budget, do not go anywhere near what is required to help create an enterprise culture and to help people who have lost their jobs to get back into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">It is time the Minister accepted and realised that those schemes were set up in a climate where we were trying to deal with long-term unemployment and not one where we are trying to deal with massively rising unemployment in such a short timeframe.  That fact alone must change how the Minister operates and how the Government does business, but it has not yet been taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The old rule that one must be unemployed for two years before one could avail of the back to work enterprise allowance was nonsense.  I am pleased the Minister has accepted that.  The change, however, does not go far enough.  The allowance has been reduced by a year, but what stopped the Minister moving to six months, which is what has been suggested by many people involved in working with the unemployed?  One year is an extremely long time to force somebody to stay on jobseeker's allowance or benefit.  I disagree with the Minister's assertion that access to the allowance is almost immediate; one must wait for a year, which is a significant proportion of a person's working life.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_635">We are talking about people who have lost their jobs, who are probably highly qualified in their own area of expertise and who do not need another degree.  They have skills and the spirit of entrepreneurship to make their ideas work.  The Minister might have seen the "Prime Time" programme recently on the back to work enterprise allowance.  Perhaps it influenced her decision.  It highlighted the ridiculous situations in which people find themselves by virtue of the way the scheme operates.  What was most worrying was the fact that failure to be approved for the scheme in some instances counted against people when they sought financial assistance from banks.  There is no logic to the way the Government is approaching those allowances, which deprive people of hope and opportunity.  While the one year change is positive, it could have been better.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">At the same time the Minister made another decision that did not make any sense in the current economic climate.  A decision to give the allowance for only two years is madness.  Everybody knows that in this climate it is more difficult to start a business and keep it up and running.  We all know of businesses that we thought had stood the test of time, that were going to be here for the long haul, but we have seen them close their doors in recent months.  How much more difficult is it for a person who has started a new business without significant financial backing who is reliant and dependent on the back to work enterprise allowance for four years to see him or her through the difficult start up phase?  The allowance provided a lift to allow a business to survive.  The decision to cut the allowance from four to two years does not make sense.  It is especially foolish when one realises that the other alternative is for a person to be on jobseeker's allowance or benefit where he or she will be in receipt of a State payment anyway.  Surely it makes more sense to try to facilitate people to stay in employment?  I cannot understand why the Minister fails to see that.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Minister stated in her budget press release that "the intention is to support enterprises who will, in due course, create further employment opportunity"  but she is making it extremely difficult for that to happen.  The positive changes the Minister has made to the scheme have been damaged by the negative changes.  The Government's mantra in recent months has been "jobs, jobs, jobs", yet the steps the Minister is taking and the decisions she is making are not in any way creating the opportunity for employment that makes those jobs a reality or even a possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I welcome the fact that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has finally seen some common sense on the operation of the back to education allowance.  I say "some", because again, while changes have been made, they do not go far enough.  It is a pity that it took so long for the Minister to make those changes.  I welcome the fact that the jobseekers who have been out of formal education for at least two years can now access the second level back to education allowance once they have been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit for at least three months.  I hope that will help people with low levels of qualification to get back into the education system and to receive formal qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The early access being provided at third level is insufficient.  Up to now there has been a requirement that a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's payment for 12 months before he or she can access the scheme.  There have been exceptions in recent times for people in employment action plan areas and people who have received redundancy.  However, the most recent figures available to me from the Department show that the numbers who have taken up the scheme are minuscule.  My overall figure, which I received in reply to a parliamentary question, is slightly different from that of the Minister.  Of the 9,796 people who are recorded as participating in the back to education allowance in November 2008, a total of 113 were awarded statutory redundancy and 75 were referred earlier to the third level option as a result of their participation in the national employment action plan, NEAP.  Those figures do not inspire hope that we will see an improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I have been waiting to get the up-to-date figures.  I was told they will be available this month but this week the Department informed me it could take another three to four weeks.  Perhaps we will see some improvement in take up.  That is difficult to say as the figures I expected to have for the debate are unavailable.  The reality is that not everybody who loses his or her job is in an employment action plan area or receives a redundancy payment.  We have seen many closures of small businesses, restaurants, shops and hotels where people are not able to avail of redundancy payments.  I do not see the sense in limiting the scheme in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">It is some improvement that the Minister will now allow access to the scheme after nine months if recommended by one of the facilitators of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as is the case currently if it is recommended by a FÁS employment services officer.  I have, however, two difficulties with that.  First, I still believe that nine months is too long.  The longest timeframe that I would find acceptable for the scheme is six months.  Second, how much work does the Minister expect those facilitators to be able to do?  We are all in favour of getting as much out of the public service as we possibly can.  There are 60 facilitators, and the Minister admitted herself in her budget press release that an average live register figure of 440,000 is likely for 2009 with some estimates putting it higher.  That is a mammoth task if each of those facilitators is to deal with each person on the live register, or even a proportion of them.  In effect, all I can see happening is that the wait to see a facilitator will replace the three months that the Minister has cut off the requirement for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">It is important to bear in mind that those are the same 60 facilitators the Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced last July would deal with numbers of young unemployed under 25 and the same facilitators the Minister said would work on "a one to one basis with lone parents".  What next for those 60 facilitators?  That change is disingenuous.  It will not achieve what it needs to achieve and it will not help those who are unemployed in an efficient, effective or meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">That brings me to the proposed changes to the jobseeker's allowance for young people outlined in the Bill.  Last July, the Minister expressed grave concern over the number of people under 25 on the live register and made a big announcement on how they could avail of the back to education allowance.  Clearly that did not work and the number of young people on the live register has grown since.  I was not surprised by the Minister's announcement having heard her interview on "News at One" on the subject of cross-Border fraud, during which she clearly supported the amounts paid to young people in Northern Ireland.  It was quite clear she was coming around to the idea of cutting young people's social welfare.  It is a pity that when she came round to this idea, she did not actually ensure there were alternatives for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The National Youth Council of Ireland stated clearly that "the jobs are simply not there and few education and training opportunities have been provided to date".  The Minister will know that approximately 17% of young people fail to complete their leaving certificate examinations.  The figures in this regard have not improved greatly despite the resources available in recent years.  I am extremely concerned that, with the cuts across the board in the education sector, including cuts affecting transition year such that only the school allowance and book allowance will be covered, and the expected scaling down of services in schools to the provision of very basic education, the figure of 17% will possibly rise or, at best, remain the same.  Nobody is fooled by the notion of incentivising 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities to prevent them from becoming welfare dependent.  I share the Minister's concerns about the young becoming welfare dependent and about their availing of social welfare immediately after leaving school.  However, she has put the cart before the horse to some extent by not ensuring that places are available to these new claimants.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The full-rate adult payment will still be made for those who participate in Youthreach — this is on a pilot footing and applicable to those of 19 years — or full-time courses in a senior travel training centre.  Will there be enough places on these courses?  It is difficult enough as matters stand to get people to do them.  I envisage many more difficulties owing to the position on the incentive that should be in place.  I do not believe there will be enough places.  If individuals qualify for the back to education allowance, they will still have to have been out of formal education for at least two years.  Therefore, what is the position in regard to somebody who has dropped out of school in mid-leaving-certificate year and who might be 18 years or almost that age?  Such a person will not be eligible for the back to education allowance for a year.  He or she can participate in a full-time FÁS training course, but only if there is one available.  I ask the Minister to outline in her concluding remarks where the places will be available for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I listened to the Tánaiste's budget speech in the House.  I was not convinced that any serious thought had gone into the proposal on activation measures.  It is more designed to save €12 million than to incentivise young people.  This is demonstrated by the fact that there are no clear facts and figures available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Who will work with the young people?  Will it be the same 60 facilitators who are to work with everybody else?  It is time the Minister got real in regard to this and appreciated the fact that, no matter how hard-working these 60 people are, they cannot bear the brunt of everything that is happening in the social welfare system.  They cannot possibly work with every single target group.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The idea of profiling first-time social welfare claimants to facilitate job programmes and more targeted training is, in principle, a good idea, but the reality and delivery on the ground will be very different.  In this regard, I am not convinced by a Minister who has failed to deal with rising queues in social welfare offices and the crisis in the community welfare system, and who has failed thus far to help young people who are unemployed.  I do not understand how this measure will address what she intends to address or says she intends to address in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The Minister has to some extent included in the Bill many of the proposals made by the Opposition over recent months but not in a way that achieves the outcomes we hoped for or intended to achieve.  This applies to the back to work enterprise allowance, the back to education allowance and the supplementary welfare payment or rent supplement.  In February, I proposed that the Minister examine rent supplement payments and conduct a review thereof in the belief that potential savings of up to €55 million could accrue this year if payments were in line with market rates.  I gave examples in February of the differences in rent reductions available across the country and used figures available from <i>daft.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The rent supplement scheme has become a critical scheme providing supposedly short-term income support to people in private rented accommodation who otherwise would have nowhere to live.  I suggested that the Minister set about lowering the ceiling for rent supplement to reflect current market rates and that, given the number of vacant properties, her staff should negotiate with the owners to reduce the financial burden on the State and increase the standard and quality available to claimants.  What did the Minister choose to do instead?  She made a blanket announcement affecting the whole country equally, changing not only the rate being paid to the landlord but also the rate the tenant must pay.  Although rent fell by 13% in Dublin and 5.8% in Galway, people from both areas will be subject to the exact same cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Minister needs to conduct a full review of the scheme, not just a cost-saving review.  It should take account of the needs of those involved.  There are parts of Dublin's city centre, for example, where rents have not been subject to any noticeable decrease.  There are particularly vulnerable groups, such as people in bed-sits, paying as much as €169 per week with a rent supplement cap of €130 per week, thus forcing them to pay top-ups to their landlords.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board is aware that such top-ups are being paid.  Threshold, which has done much work in this area, demonstrates that this is still very much a live issue.  It has not been tackled.  In theory, these tops-ups are illegal but there are no real checks to determine whether they are being paid.  In some cases, vulnerable tenants are forced to make these payments.  There is still no adequate checking of the quality of the accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, together with the Minister of State responsible for housing, who was reappointed today, who has plenty of experience, needs to examine the vacant properties and consider the possibility of including them in the rental accommodation scheme with a view to including more people.  The Minister announced today there will be 1,000 more places available under the scheme.  This will just about bring us half way towards meeting the commitment made on where we should stand at present.  Announcing 1,000 more places is no great cause for celebration as we are nowhere near where we should be.  The opportunities under the rental accommodation scheme by comparison with those under the rent supplement scheme, in terms of getting rid of poverty traps and allowing people to work, are far more beneficial.  We should concentrate on this.  The scheme should be working much better.  Removing the traps and increasing the opportunities to work would be much more cost effective for the State and far more beneficial to the tenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Government needs to get tougher on landlords.  I could not believe that the Minister, in her speech, asked us to help send out a message to landlords.  That is the job of the Minister responsible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_655">Deputy Hanafin is the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and a Minister of State responsible for housing has been reappointed.  In addition, there is a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and a Minister for Finance, yet, between them, they cannot deal with the issue of landlords.  How many more times are we going to discuss in the House the fact that there is still no link between rent supplement paid to landlords and checks to ensure those landlords are paying tax out of the moneys paid to them by the State in respect of their properties?  We have raised this at committees, including with the Revenue Commissioners, and in the House.  Those responsible just nod and say they are considering the matter.  How long more will we be considering it?  When will we see something happen?  It is very easy to take €6 more from a tenant after having taken the same from him or her in October.  It may be a bit tougher to put in place the system I advocate but there is no reason it is not in place, as it should be.  That it is not is a failure on the Minister's part.  We have discussed it time and again and it needs to be fast-tracked.  Surely when trying to make savings, ensuring that we get the most from the taxation system would be a sensible place to start.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Threshold has asked, quite reasonably, what support the Department is to offer regarding the process of negotiating rent reductions.  It is a fair question because there should be support for tenants.  Some landlords will take advantage of a vulnerable person, particularly in areas where there may not be many alternative properties.  The principle of reducing rent supplement with falling market rent is important but the blanket approach adopted will only result in hardship for many vulnerable people.  It is not the best approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">It has been suggested that the Minister should set up a system whereby, rather than having a community welfare officer hand over a deposit to a tenant for a landlord, that deposit would be held in an account and made available to the landlord if the property was not handed back in good condition.  Currently the deposit is paid directly to the landlord and tenants find it very difficult to recover it at the end of their tenancy.  Threshold has estimated that the Department could save between €6 million and €7 million per year if my proposal were implemented.  I have asked the Minister about this in the past and I again ask her to examine it.  The deposit holding scheme I advocate would save the State money and would make more sense.  Since tenants will have to shop around owing to the reduction in the supplement, the holding scheme, if implemented, will mean their deposits will be refundable because the landlords will not get their hands on them unless, for whatever reason, the tenants leave the properties in poor condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The Minister's decision in the budget to increase by €6 the minimum contribution to rent supplement after a similar increase in the October budget is extremely unfair and will make life really difficult for poorer vulnerable tenants.  The changes to the maximum rent figure to which the supplement applies were sufficient and what the Minister has done in increasing the contribution will make it extremely difficult to access accommodation because of the amount tenants themselves will have to pay.  On the submission made by Focus Ireland, will the Minister ensure that no person will become homeless as a result of the changes made to the rent supplement and jobseeker's allowance schemes?  Despite the money available and, to some extent, squandered in the past 12 years, the Government did not do what could have been done to tackle the issue of homelessness.  Despite the existence of a Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the matter still seems to fall between a number of Departments.  There are real concerns that there will be difficulties in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I am glad the Minister stated she would table an amendment on young persons who have left State care.  That is important.  She also needs to examine the position of young persons who have left the family home which I fully appreciate is a much more tricky issue.  Their position is not as simple as that of young persons who have left State care but there are situations where there is a severe breakdown within families for one reason or another, as a result of which young persons are forced to leave.  There are young persons who have not had to go into State care because they are aged 17 or 18 years but they are still in the vulnerable position to which I refer.  Perhaps community welfare officers who tend to know the persons concerned should have the flexibility to make a payment in such circumstances rather than see a young person, by reason of drugs or alcoholism in their own case or in the case of somebody else in the family home, being left vulnerable if homeless as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The Bill compounds the attack on families that took place in Budget 2009.  In addition to charges, taxes and the pain being felt by everybody else, in a double whammy those with young children are being hit through the loss of the early child care supplement, while those with children in their late teens will be hit through the introduction of third level fees.  In the next budget those with children of any age will be hit through some form of change to child benefit.  The budget of October 2008 made every household pay for Fianna Fáil's mistakes and the emergency budget of 2009 has ensured every family will pay on the double.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">What is laughable about the changes to the early child care supplement and the introduction of a year's free preschool place, if the matter was not so serious, is that in recent years Fine Gael and the Labour Party made this proposal and tried to persuade the Government which then had the money of the importance of preschool education.  During 12 years of what the Government certainly thought were unlimited resources, it failed to introduce such a provision.  I remember debating the matter here with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on one occasion when she questioned the educational value of preschool education.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">The Minister stated there was a social value and a value in interaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Now that finances are tighter and the Government wants to make savings but does not want to be seen as too much of a bad guy because the local elections are coming up, it will cut and then abolish the early child care supplement and replace it with a free preschool place for one year.  I am not sure if the Government has really worked out the mathematics.  I am sure it did from its own perspective in saving money, but it was not from the perspective of a family with a newborn child who would be losing a payment for five and a half years to be replaced by preschool support for 38 weeks.  It provides little comfort for families who must make some really tough decisions.  It is critical to remember that these are the same families who bought houses in the past few years at extortionate prices and who are paying massive mortgages, one third of which is actually a payment to the Government because that is the portion of their mortgage that relates to the tax they are paying on their home.  These young couples are faced with a choice — can they both afford to stay at work?  Can they afford the cost of child care or can they afford to stay at home?  Even a difference of €30 to €40 a week in income is immense help in making such decisions and trying to budget and balance their books.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The way in which Fianna Fáil introduced the early child care supplement was a typical example of the way it moved to gain kudos with the electorate.  On six occasions in the House after it was introduced Ministers, as well as the former Taoiseach, gave different figures for what it would cost.  Nobody at the time realised that it would have to be paid for children not in this country but whose parents were, even though the supplement was supposed to meet the cost of child care provided here, and with a click of the fingers it is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I still have questions on the provision of a free preschool place for one year.  I still question the Government's ability to deliver on such a measure by next January.  We are spending €50 million a year on prefabs in the primary and post-primary sector, yet the Government thinks it can deliver up to 80,000 places by January.  I do not think anybody believes that is possible.  We have yet to see a breakdown of how and where the places will be provided.  All the press releases issued since the announcement have not answered these questions.  The Minister is asking the House to vote to abolish the early child care supplement when she has given little or no consideration to what will be in its place and the impact on families.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Minister has stated the figure "equates to a weekly capitation grant to the service provider of €64.50 and parents with children enrolled in these services will not be charged."  I spoke to a child care provider today who has had some discussions with whoever is in charge in the Department and the provider seemed to be of the opinion that there would be an ability to charge a top-up fee.  I ask the Minister if she is sure of the figure of €64.50 and that top-ups will not be charged because people are not sure.  Where providers are charging more already I cannot see how they will reduce their prices.  Will families have to pay a top-up charge to some providers?  There are not uniform charges across the country.  Will we now see those, perhaps in more rural areas, charging less upping their prices?  How did the Minister arrive at the figure of €64.50?  What about the extra facilities that will be needed?  Currently, there is no funding available because of the review of the NDP.  These questions need to be asked.  People know when they are being sold a pup, as they certainly are in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The decisions taken in the Bill echo those taken in the budget.  There is a lack of vision, strategic thinking and real reform.  What there has been is much tinkering, mostly aimed at saving money with the odd nod towards the possibility that people will be given a little bit of a break.  However, all it is is a nod.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Twice the Minister almost bragged about an increase in social welfare expenditure.  The only reason it has increased is that the numbers unemployed have increased.  This is something we should all deplore rather than speak of as something for which the Department has received a little extra because those affected are not getting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The Minister spoke about deflation and the protection of living standards.  Much of the deflation has been in the area of mortgage payments.  Gas prices, electricity prices, bus fares and cost of primary education have increased.  The week before last I met the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which told me that there had been a 30% increase in the number of calls made to it.  The only places where it has not seen an increase are the Border counties where people are able to cross the Border to buy food where it is cheaper.  That highlights the difficulties being experienced by families.  Deflation may help some but it is not helping everyone and it is disingenuous to suggest it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The positive changes made are not enough to really make a difference or a dent in the live register figures and get people into training or back to work.  The changes to the rent supplement scheme are too blunt and what could have been really good cost saving changes are only going to hurt a significant number of people rather than truly take advantage of falling market rates.  The idea of incentivising young people to return to education or training through profiling is only window dressing aimed essentially at cutting payments to them.  The reduction in the value of the early child care supplement and its abolition will cause untold difficulties for young families.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">We still have received no details on the information which must be provided by claimants in making a claim for benefit.  Overall, there is nothing in the Bill that will facilitate people in getting back to work.  Everything depends on the work of 60 facilitators who will deal with hundreds of thousands of unemployed persons.  The Christmas bonus is being removed but it is not even mentioned in the legislation.  It was a quick lazy attempt at saving money.  The Government in no way tried to deal with or solve the problems endemic in the system.  As a result, we will still have queues at social welfare offices and community welfare officers will be unable to cope with the level of demand.  In fact, this will be compounded by the changes to the rent supplement scheme.  No assistance is being given to facilitate the changes.  More and more people will turn to community welfare officers seeking exceptional needs payments because of the social welfare cuts contained in the Bill.  No extra assistance has been given to MABS or funding made available for mortgage interest supplements.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">On the changes to the Bill that the Minister announced she will introduce on Committee Stage, I will wait until then to comment on them.  However, it is time to bring forward the recommendations made in the White Paper on pensions rather than just tinkering with the system.  Real decisions need to be taken.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_682">The Social Welfare Bill 2009 is about social welfare in name only.  It is unashamedly about extra taxes and reduced benefits with hardly any measures that will actually improve our social security system, help the poor or those struggling in the recession.  For the most part, it is a finance Bill in disguise.  What concerns me most is how families will be able to afford many of its measures, particularly families with very young children.  With the introduction of the health levies under section 12 and the abolition of the early child care supplement under section 8, a single-income family with two children under five years on €40,000 a year will lose €230 per month from their net monthly income.  Add the income levy, the abolition of mortgage interest relief, additional excise on diesel and such a family will incur extra costs amounting to more than €3,000 a year.  Many families will pay more.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Labour Party is opposed to the Bill for what it does to family budgets, how it threatens jobs and how it hits easy targets instead of raising revenue in other areas.  It contains several of the largest cuts announced in the supplementary budget.  It proposes halving and the eventual abolition of the early child care supplement.  The supplement may have been introduced by Fianna Fáil to bribe the electorate, but it has since become an essential part of family budgets.  As such, its abolition will have a serious impact on the ability of some families to make ends meet.  A family with two children under five years will lose €83 a month from 1 May.  The same family will lose a staggering €166 a month from 1 January next.  That has the same effect as halving child benefit for the same family.  It was interesting that when child benefit for 18 year olds was abolished last year in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, a tapering arrangement was provided for welfare recipients with children to allow them to adjust to the sudden drop in income.  No such provision is contained in this Bill.  Many parents who have lost their jobs will now have to put up with a massive reduction in the amount of support they receive for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Contrary to the impression created by some media commentators, the introduction of a subsidy towards preschool costs only fractionally offsets the substantial loss of income for the young families affected.  Instead of a payment of about €5,000 for the first five years of their child's life, parents will now receive a payment for one year in preschool.  The abolition of the early child care supplement comes at a time when the cost of child care for families continues to rise — up 5.8% in the past year, yet the budget contained no measures to tackle prices in this sector or to address excessive rent and insurance costs for providers.  For many young families, child care costs are often higher than mortgage costs and always higher than the cost of groceries.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">One Dublin family with two children under two years this week gave me detailed accounts of their monthly outgoings.  One parent works full-time and the other part-time.  It costs the family €5,000 on average each month to run the household.  They have a modest lifestyle — they have one car, one annual holiday, a two-bedroom ex-council house, are non-smokers and have a mortgage of only €60,000.  Even sending the children to a child care facility only three days a week, their child care bill comes to €1,500 a month, 30% of all outgoings.  This is the real cost of having young children in 2009.  It is the reality that no one in government and few in the media seem to appreciate.  Rising child care costs mean that while some families may be benefiting from deflation, the cost of living is actually rising for parents who use child care facilities — the very people hit by this cutback.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The focus of the public has been, by and large, on the extra income levies.  However, many do not realise that the doubling of health levy rates represents the single largest tax increase for most workers in the supplementary budget.  Section 12 proposes new rates of 4% and 5%, with the 4% rate starting at €26,000 and the 5% rate at €75,036.  For that same family on €40,000 to whom I referred, the reduction in take-home pay from the health levy alone will be €66.67 per month, double the income levy bill.  The income and health levies combined will take €100 a month from such a family.  How on earth is taxing people on modest incomes by taking €100 from their monthly income going to restore consumer confidence or protect jobs?  It is a recipe for disaster with people cutting back more and taking more trips to the North.  Surely there was scope to introduce a tapering arrangement.  Under the proposed arrangement, the effect of the levy is such that a person on €26,500 will have a lower net income than a person on €25,500.  Yet again, we have another proposal from the Government that it has failed to work out properly before it presented it.  I urge the Minister to adjust it on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Sections 5 and 6 propose to introduce new rules for job seekers.  What precisely has the Minister in mind?  The phrasing appears to suggest a job seeker's payment could be refused if a person were not to agree to take a training or development course when requested to do so by a departmental official.  All the announcements around the budget suggested such a move was for young people leaving school with no mention of it being extended to everyone, yet that appears to be the intention as the Bill is drafted.  No indication is given as to what constitutes a reasonable offer.  For instance, one could not offer an unemployed IT specialist a computer course or someone in Drogheda a place on a course in Wexford.  Who would pick up the cost of attendance or what would happen if there were transport, family or health issues?  Where are the course places?  Who will provide them and who will pay?  Is there a way of appealing a decision?  Will a claimant still be counted on the live register?</p>
          <p eId="para_688">As regards the under 20s, the Labour Party believes the worst outcome for a young person is that he or she goes straight from school onto the dole.  I have no problem with the general scenario of making welfare payments contingent on attendance at an education, training or development course.  However, there are several categories of teenagers that simply will not fit into this scenario.  I am concerned about the Bill's proposals in this regard and that the details have not been properly considered by the Minister.  I am concerned that it is included among a package of measures designed to save money.  It should be introduced only on a revenue neutral basis, with the savings in welfare reinvested in training and development courses.  The State will still profit in the long run by preventing long-term dependency on welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">There are already several caps in place on PLC and VEC courses, with demand far exceeding supply.  There are no guarantees in the Bill that a suitable course will be available to each claimant or on the quality of those courses.  Can I take it from the way section 6 is framed that the claimant will not be denied his or her full entitlement to social welfare unless an officer requests him or her to take up a course, and that there will be no automatic disbarring from the current payment?  The Minister might let us know how these provisions will work if no course is available because, clearly, there is a lack of sufficient quality training places at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">What guidelines will the Minister put in place for this scheme?  As Deputies, we all get very mixed opinions from the public about individual job liaison personnel.  Some claimants get the feeling they are simply being processed, especially when staff are dealing with people in such large numbers, as at present.  This reform will be a disaster if that attitude remains.  Guidelines in this area will have to be very clear and where disagreement arises between front-line staff and the claimant, there should be a right of appeal.  The Minister might consider examining this for Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The Minister needs to clarify what will happen if there is a genuine difficulty in completing or attending a course for any number of reasons, such as family, transport, health issues or the cost involved.  For instance, what happens in the case of a young drug user who may get a place on a drug treatment course and must attend daily for methadone?  What rules will apply in those circumstances?</p>
          <p eId="para_692">There will be some categories of young people for whom the new arrangements will simply not fit.  Young people who leave State care may simply not be in a position to take up a training place.  If, for example, a young person has left State care, cannot return to the family home and has to rent, he or she will be left with a net weekly income of just €76 per week because of the combined effect of changes in this Bill and changes to rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_694">I welcome that indication.  A similar dilemma presents itself for young people in transitional accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The wisest course of action is for the Minister to be provided with powers in the Bill to exempt by regulation certain categories of unemployed teenagers from these provisions.  This would allow the Minister to establish a period of public consultation and reflection on this measure before the relevant sections are commenced and to exempt people before they cause unnecessary hardship.  If this is really about activation, the Minister should have no problem doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Section 7(<i>b</i>) proposes to disallow rent supplement unless a person is an existing tenant or has been assessed by his or her local authority as being in need of housing.  In my view, this measure is reckless and downright irresponsible.  It puts in harm’s way young people who have a serious falling out with their parents and any person who, for example, is subject to abuse in the family home.  I am appalled by this measure.  It is a bull-headed ivory tower reform of the worst possible kind and reflects a pathetic understanding on the part of the Minister about the reality on the ground.  I do not have any confidence that the discretion afforded to community welfare officers is sufficient to guarantee that no one is made homeless from this proposal.  I spoke to Focus Ireland about these measures and it does not have much confidence either.  Can the Minister absolutely guarantee that no one will be made homeless as a result of this measure?  If she cannot, then why is she attempting to pass this proposal?  The Minister might respond directly to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Of course, other cutbacks are also being made by regulation to the minimum contribution a person must make to rent supplement and to the maximum amount of support a person may receive under the scheme.  The Labour Party accepts that there are savings to be made from rent supplement at a time when some rents are falling, although it has to be pointed out that rents are only 1.3% lower now than when the rent supplement limits were changed in January 2007, and the 6% to 10% cut is certainly excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">There is also something pathetic about a policy decision being taken based on what the Daft website states.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">Daft does not keep any figures on rents at the lower end of the market.  I am talking specifically about poor quality bed-sits where many young people, including those at risk, stay.  As far as I know — perhaps the Minister can tell me to the contrary — no information is available on what is happening to rents in that category.  The anecdotal information would suggest that because of harder times and more people seeking low-cost accommodation, those rents are not reducing.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_707">This latest Social Welfare Bill will hit hardest the former poster children of the Celtic tiger.  Young families with large mortgages and young children will be most affected by these proposals.  It will also hit those who did not benefit from the Celtic tiger by reducing rent allowance and halving the jobseeker's allowance in certain cases.  The Bill is the latest from a Government which is out of touch.  Irish people want to see those who did the best during the boom times paying their share but this is simply not happening and this Bill is doing nothing to move in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The decision to reduce mortgage interest supplement to seven years is a serious decision which will have negative consequences for thousands of families across the State.  One of the legacies of the Ahern-Cowen era of Government will be the reckless way in which they allowed the housing market to be inflated.  Massive tax incentives were offered to landlords.  The media is also culpable, given its relentless promotion of the property ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The net result was that many people bought houses for huge sums, often a long distance from their work or families.  They were encouraged to do this and offered mortgages beyond their wildest dreams.  They were given access to funds when anyone looking at the conditions and the prospects of repayment would have suggested there were sure to be tears at the end of the rainbow, not a pot of gold.  However, young families needed a home and bought into the dream.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The mortgage interest supplement is now to be reduced to seven years.  People are struggling to pay their mortgages as the banks, which the Government guaranteed on behalf of this country, continue to charge sizeable interest despite the historically low interest rates.  Surely, it would not have been too much to ask that these banks do some service to the State and to the suffering families by offering a penalty-free switching window for those on fixed rate mortgages.  Instead of trying to relieve hard-pressed householders by driving a hard bargain on their behalf, the Government has cut costs and brought serious misery to people across this country who bought into their vision of the board game "Monopoly".</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The Labour Party fully supports the policy of the provision of one year of free early child care to all children in the State and it is one we have backed for a long time, although not as a back door to cutting the early child care supplement.  As Deputy Shortall pointed out, this may have been a sweetener when it was introduced but the reality now is that families have come to depend on it and it has become part of their standard budget.  Cutting it will cause serious hardship for them.  The new scheme is not established and the question is whether it will it be ready when the early child care supplement is abolished.  Cutting the early child care supplement between now and the end of the year, as is due to happen, will only drive up costs for young families when crèche fees are increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">For those who have fallen on hard times the Bill is no saviour.  The decision to cut rent allowance has been addressed by Deputy Shortall but a number of issues arise.  The minimum contribution is being increased by 33% and the rent allowance is being reduced by 8% for existing claimants, with maximum claims for future tenants being reduced by between 6% and 10%.  The decision to reduce payments by 8% is based on the assumption that landlords will have no choice but to reduce the rent charged by this amount but this is by no means certain.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">In Dublin city, there are thousands of people on the housing list who are in receipt of rent allowance.  They will not necessarily be able to take advantage of the cheap rents available in other parts of the country, nor will many of them be in a position to drive a bargain with a greedy landlord.  They will be left at risk and vulnerable.   Those who will be most affected by this decision will be those who need a large house and who may be relying on only one rent allowance to house a family of four, for example.  The nightmare scenario is that these people could end up homeless.  Instead of an arbitrary reduction in rent allowance we should have had reform and a move towards a system of support based on dependence.  Instead the heavy hand of the Government has merely come down with a harsh and probably counterproductive decision, most likely to hurt those who can least afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Another issue which my party will be raising in Private Members' time is the decision to cut the Christmas bonus to all social welfare recipients.  I intend speaking on the motion, but suffice to say that while I know it does not need legislation and is not contained in the Bill, this is a sneaky and underhand move which will cause misery for many people at the most expensive time of year.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The decision to cut the jobseeker's allowance for under 20s to €100 is another poor decision.  The Government's pedigree of such sweeping decisions is not good.  No one wants people to graduate from school onto the dole.  However, there must be opportunities for everyone and they must know those opportunities are available and the places exist.  We have yet to be presented with a concrete plan to show that anyone under 20 who wants to continue in education or training will be able to do so.  As the number of courses in the PLC colleges is capped, where are the places likely to arise?  There is no certainty that everyone who wants to will have access to an appropriate course or training programme.  I have already received e-mails on the capping on the number of places on PLCs which, of course, have been in place for a long time.  It means that people who want to get onto those courses now will not be able to do so.  I hope more concrete plans are in place in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The Social Welfare Bill offers nothing to protect the most vulnerable and does nothing to help people who have lost their jobs.  Instead it seeks to reduce access to entitlements such as mortgage interest supplement or to scrap others such as the Christmas bonus and the early child care supplement.  At the same time, those who profited most are being bailed out by NAMA.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_717">A second budget in a single year is virtually unprecedented.  Likewise a second Social Welfare Bill is virtually unprecedented, especially coming after the pensions levy that was imposed earlier this year.  Two budgets and a pensions levy have stripped the taxpayer of a huge tranche of income in the past six months.  One would have expected the Social Welfare Bill to go in the opposite direction and enhance the entitlements of social welfare recipients, the less well off, the unemployed, senior citizens and the children of the nation.  However the opposite is the effect of the Bill.  Either there is a reduction or a loss of social welfare entitlements or a few miserable crumbs are thrown in the direction of the growing legions of the unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The PRSI earnings ceiling is increased by 50% for employees.  The jobseeker's allowance, supplementary welfare allowance schemes and the early child-care supplement are all addressed in the Social Welfare Bill in a negative way.  There is a direct attack on young people who become unemployed by reducing their jobseeker's allowance to €100 per week, half what an adult over 20 is entitled to.  The early child care supplement is more than halved to an annual €498 from 1 May 2009 and will be abolished on 1 January 2010.  There is an increase in the rate of the health contribution as well as a lowering of the earnings threshold.  Earnings emoluments and income are all aggregated for the purpose of calculation of the contribution.  What a mean and miserable series of amendments to the social welfare code are contained in this Social Welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Unconscionably, mortgage interest relief for hard-pressed families, is abolished after seven years.  The minimum contribution to rent supplement by a tenant has increased by a third in this budget, having already been increased in the previous budget in October.  At the same time all existing rent supplement payments have been reduced by 8% on the somewhat questionable expectation that landlords will voluntarily decrease their rents.  What will happen if landlords do not do so?  What will the community welfare officers do about that?  What instructions will the Minister give to ensure people are not evicted or become homeless?  The Minister cannot just rely on the good will of landlords to reduce their rents in accordance with the provisions of the Social welfare Bill.  It just does not happen like that in the real world.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The unkindest cut of all is the abolition of the Christmas bonus double payment for all social welfare recipients.  This was the little bit extra that provided some cheer for hard-pressed families and allowed presents to be purchased for children to make Christmas a memorable time.  It also provided senior citizens with that bit extra that helped provide a welcome buffer against increased heating bills, food and medical costs and a present for the grandchildren.  Scrooge will once again stalk the family homes this Christmas.  I received an e-mail on the matter from the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and of course it will be discussed later in Private Members' time.  It is more than 50 years since the Christmas bonus was introduced in 1955, particularly to benefit old-age pensioners.  Naturally the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament is disgusted that such a measure should have been rescinded in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The security scheme for the elderly has been suspended by the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">She has been ably aided and abetted by her Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  That scheme provided older people with personal alarms, security lighting, door locks etc. and was operated by voluntary groups.  It is shameful that a couple of million euro would be cut off when it provided such a valuable service and peace of mind to so many elderly people.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Minister for Finance has disproportionately attacked the low paid and middle earning taxpayers in the budget.  Now the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has savaged the entitlements of those who have paid their dues while they worked but are now unfortunately unemployed through no fault of their own.  The Government's answer to the economic crisis is to pile taxes and levies on the taxpayer and reduce the payments to the unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Government has no vision, no leadership and nothing to offer.  There is no strategy to keep working people in employment.  There is no initiative to support firms who are experiencing operational and trading difficulties.  There is no attempt to combine social welfare payments and part-time or reduced working hours or working days to keep a company afloat and maintain jobs.  There is an unhealthy and dangerous obsession with the banks — guaranteeing recapitalising and supporting the toxic debts at home and abroad of all the Irish banks.  At the same time the dysfunctional boardrooms of all these banks remain virtually unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Some 200,000 jobs have been lost in the past two years.  If the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which is haemorrhaging jobs at present, was supported in a holistic and integrated fashion by the Minister's colleagues, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, to see what interventions could be made to make credit flow available to those enterprises, which employ 50% of those employed and 64% of the entire private sector, there would be many fewer recipients of social welfare.  However, there is no strategy to intervene and provide the necessary assistance or the credit flow which represents the lifeblood of those enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Social Welfare Bill pays lip service to helping the 200,000 newly unemployed.  A mere 25,000 places in welfare schemes of one sort or another for the unemployed are being provided, which is less than the average monthly job loss in recent months.  As Deputy Upton said, the post leaving certificate courses have been capped.  Very little can be done in that area unless they are uncapped.  Courses have been capped also in the National College of Ireland in my constituency.  Therefore, we cannot provide the courses that would be ideal for the unemployed, with various schemes aimed at retraining, upskilling and furthering their knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">This is a very poor Social Welfare Bill.  It adds further to the dismal contribution made in the budget by the Minister for Finance and will make for a dismal year for all social welfare recipients.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_448">
          <from>Deputy Cyprian Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_729">At this time of economic turmoil throughout the world, the fact that we have managed to maintain the majority of our welfare payments must be commended.  Nobody involved in public life likes making changes, particularly to the welfare system which affects people's standard of living on a daily basis and their prospects for future improvement.  In the current crisis every effort must be made to protect the most vulnerable in society.  In order for us to do this, all sections of society must adapt and adjust to the times in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">In the past decade successive Governments have managed to improve people's living standards, whether they were working, unemployed, old-age pensioners or on illness or invalidity benefit.  Rates of payment have increased yearly for many years, while waiting times in processing claims and appeals have reduced year on year.  The efficiency of the Department of Social and Family Affairs has improved over time, due in particular to the use of technology.  We have seen a rapid and dramatic increase in the number of claimants.  This increase is unprecedented in such a short period of time and is due to a number of factors, including the increase in the population and the new communities who have come here in recent years to take advantage of the progress made in the economy.  We must take these issues into consideration when dealing with our current problems.  The Bill goes some way towards doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The number on the live register at the end of February 2008 was approximately 190,000.  This figure increased by 165,000, or 87%, to 355,000, approximately, at the end of February this year.  As the Minister stated, these numbers represent families and individuals who must deal with the spectre of unemployment.  This is shocking for them.  Having worked in an employment exchange I have seen at first hand the effect of having to seek social welfare assistance for the first time on people who have been employed and had a certain standard of living.  Having to go through that experience is extremely traumatic.  Every effort has been and is being made to ensure those experiencing unemployment for the first time are given priority and dealt with as efficiently and sensitively as possible.  The increase in staffing in the Department and the reallocation of resources are designed to ensure this happens.  Behind the figures and statistics there are families and individuals who must be catered and cared for.  It is said a society can be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable members.  Every effort is being made to look after the vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Despite the remarkable increase and the speed of the increase in the numbers looking for social welfare payments, the system cannot change overnight.  It must adapt and be adapted.  All that can be done is being done in order that the resources available will be used properly and efficiently to ensure as quick a turnaround as possible and to ensure those most in need are provided with the basic means to live from day to day.  Some of the changes required are being made in this legislation.  The Minister has pointed out that, putting aside borrowing, the social welfare expenditure provided for in the budget is expected to account for 60% of anticipated Exchequer current revenue from tax and other sources.  This is a significant amount of money.  We will spend almost €22 billion this year on our welfare system.  There are not many countries of the size of Ireland that are either willing to do, or capable of doing, the same.  Credit must be given for the fact that we will maintain the system in the current climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Some hard decisions had to be made in the the current economic environment.  Nobody in public life likes making harsh decisions that affect people on a daily basis.  The decisions made on the welfare system by the Department were not taken lightly or easily, but they were made in the best interests of ensuring the resources we have available and can provide are used fairly and efficiently to ensure those who need help most receive it.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Some of the changes to be made are to the rent supplement scheme.  For many years high rents have been paid to landlords for substandard accommodation, as I have seen in my constituency.  Advantage has been taken of people in the market.  Some of the changes proposed in the legislation will ensure landlords take their responsibilities seriously and take account of the changes taking place in the rental market.  Rents are changing daily.  The Department must ensure those landlords receiving rent supplement on behalf of tenants provide an adequate standard of accommodation at a reasonable price.  The market will dictate this and the changes being made in the legislation will ensure it will happen.  It is in the interests of tenants that standards improve and rents are adequate and fair in the current economic environment.  Housing authorities, particularly in major cities, are not in a position to provide emergency or short-term rental accommodation.  The only alternative, therefore, is for the State to step in and provide people with the means to find accommodation.  Some of the changes being proposed in the Bill will ensure standards and the efficiency of the rental supplement system will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">It is also proposed to increase the minimum contribution made by individuals and families towards their rent.  One of the reported impediments to the transfer of rent supplement claimants to the rental accommodation scheme is the significant difference between the contribution required of the tenant under the rent supplement scheme and that which they are required to pay under the differential rent scheme.  This has been an issue.  I understand from the Minister's contribution that a commitment has been given to ensure there will be a transfer of a significant number, up to 1,000 people, to the rental accommodation scheme.  While this system has been slow in taking off and difficult to implement in some areas, it will prove itself in time.  Co-operation is needed from landlords to ensure the system is successful.  The onus is on local authorities to ensure the rental accommodation available is adequate, of a decent standard and at a decent price.  Some of the changes proposed in the Bill will ensure that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">New measures to improve processing times for claims are being introduced, including a streamlined process for those who have made a claim in the previous two years.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">The Government decision not to provide for a double payment to social welfare recipients this Christmas is, in the Labour Party's opinion, mean-spirited and unnecessary.  The traditional bonus payment has been paid since 1980.  Not everyone on welfare receives it, just those who are most heavily dependent, namely, those on pensions or long-term welfare payments.  People affected include those receiving blind pension, carers payments, disability payments, farm assist, guardians payments, invalidity pension, jobseeker's allowance, one-parent family payment, pre-retirement allowance, deserted wife payments, prisoner's wife allowance, State pension and widow's and widower's pension   Claimants stand to lose up to €240.30 each or approximately 2% of their income.  In the case of most married couples, the combined loss will be well over €400.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Since more than 1 million people are affected by this move, everyone knows someone who is affected.  Everyone recognises the seriousness of the economic situation in which we find ourselves and that the Government's back is to the wall, but it is when backs are to the wall that one sees the true priorities of Government and what it is really made of.  For goodness' sake, if as a country we could afford a Christmas bonus in 1980, how on Earth can we not afford one in 2009?</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has stated that the choice was to cut the Christmas bonus or to cut welfare rates generally, but this was not the choice.  The Government had other revenue raising options available to it, but ignored them.   Evidently, the Government would rather hit pensioners and the poor than phase out what amounts to a €700 million tax relief subsidy for landlords of commercial and residential properties.  Evidently, it is fine in an emergency to suspend payments to long-term welfare recipients, yet leave untouched the hundreds of millions of euro in tax relief for the pensions of rich company directors.  Evidently, people on low fixed incomes can afford to take a hit next Christmas while the 6,000 tax exiles remain untouched by tax reform.  There were many other options, such as seeking reductions in the rent paid out by State bodies and Departments, capping public sector pay or the famous text tax, but none was taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">In practical terms, suspending the Christmas bonus will mean that older people and poorer people will struggle to heat their homes this Christmas because, in many cases, the bonus is used to pay for a refill of the oil tank, to stock up on coal or briquettes or to pay off the larger gas bills at that time of year.  For some, scrapping the bonus will mean there is less available for presents for the family or money for the little things that matter a lot, like sending Christmas cards to family and friends or taking grandchildren somewhere special, like to a pantomime or to the cinema.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I hope the Minister will take in my next point.  For the economy generally, it will mean even less money being spent in our shops this year at Christmas because no one saves the Christmas bonus.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">Effectively, the cut will take millions of euro out of the economy and threaten jobs further.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">We are constantly hearing that the cost of living is going down.  Yes, it is going down for some.  If one has a large tracker mortgage and has managed to hold on to one's job, then one's cost of living is clearly declining.  However, most people who receive the Christmas bonus do not have a mortgage.  In most cases, they are either pensioners and their mortgages are already paid up or they are local authority tenants and their rent is related to their incomes.  These rents have not decreased.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">We accept that the reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank in recent months has impacted heavily on the consumer price index.  However, when one measures inflation without mortgage interest, prices are at a similar level to last year.  In fact, they are down by just 0.3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice tells us that many people on welfare are already struggling to make ends meet.  Its detailed analysis of the weekly budgets of typical family types, such as a pensioner living on her own, shows that, even at existing levels of welfare support, incomes are often not matching outgoings.  This is why the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, instead of our social welfare system, has become the safety net for people at the lower end of the spectrum in recent years.  If not for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stepping in, many people would be having a dreadful time.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice research also shows that, for a lone pensioner on a non-contributory pension without a car, the weekly shortfall is €43.61.  That is the shortfall between what such a pensioner needs as a minimum essential budget and what he or she gets on his or her old age pension.  In this instance, taking away the Christmas bonus means taking away Christmas.  The same research shows that for most people on welfare discretionary spending is very low.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">There is an obvious point about the demands of Christmas.  Even for families that can withstand the pressures of advertising, there are still significant costs involved in even a modest Christmas celebration.  Without extra income at Christmas, some of those families will be forced into the hands of moneylenders.  There has been a 30% increase in the number of clients attending the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  In the first three months of this year, MABS dealt with more than 5,000 new clients, of whom 75 had sub-prime loans, 363 had moneylender loans, 254 had overdraft problems, 1,258 had credit card difficulties and 2,671 were in trouble with personal bank loans.  Crucially, two thirds of these MABS clients were social welfare recipients.  This statistic alone shows how dependent welfare recipients are on every cent they get and just how vital is the Christmas bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">In concluding, I wish to address my remarks to the many Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Independent Members who have run for cover tonight.  Regrettably, not a single Government backbencher has turned up for this debate.  I hope some of them are listening in their offices, as I intend to address my remarks to them.  Members such as Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae, who have been supporting the Government, as well as Fianna Fáil backbenchers who habitually proclaim their commitment to the less well-off, now will have the chance to decide where they stand on this crucial issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">I have spelled out what the suspension of the Christmas bonus will mean in practical terms but the backbenchers probably know that already.  I have cited the types of families that will be affected and how they already are struggling, and the backbenchers know that too.  However, they also must know what the public is saying about them, which is that they would rather defend their long-service increment than the Christmas bonus for long-term welfare recipients.  For the most part, I do not believe this is true because when a rumour circulated late last year that the Government would not pay the 2008 Christmas bonus, several Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke up and showed just whose side they were on.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">For example, the new Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady had something to say in this regard.  When it was finally confirmed that a payment would be made, Deputy Brady declared, "The Government ensured that this Christmas bonus payment would be protected as so many people rely on that extra money at Christmas and use it to plan their finances over that period."  This point still holds true now and there is something ironic about the fact that the Deputy in question, who understood last year the importance of the Christmas bonus, now has responsibility for the elderly.  I hope she still understands its importance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, described the Christmas bonus as a €200 million boost for the Irish economy, which it was.  The economy needs it more than ever in 2009, as nothing has changed except that matters have worsened.  Deputy O'Flynn reminded those who had been calling him with regard to the Christmas bonus that, "I have been pressing the Minister for Social Welfare on this matter".  Deputy O'Flynn can stand up tomorrow in respect of this issue when it counts.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I believe most Fianna Fáil Deputies, and perhaps even some from the Green Party, are secretly angered by this cut.  I believe that most of them do not consider it to be fair and that many realise it is not necessary and constitutes a huge political mistake.  If this is the case, why do they allow those who are at the top dictate to them? How can they tell their constituents that cutting the Christmas bonus is an act of social solidarity?  How can the backbenchers stand behind a Cabinet that ignored them on medical cards for the over-70s and now is ignoring them on this issue?  I urge each Government backbencher to use the hours between now and the vote tomorrow to convince their Cabinet colleagues that this is not the correct course of action and that other options are available to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">If backbenchers can turn around the Government before tomorrow's vote in the interests of the poor, their constituents and their party, they should do so, as this is their chance.  However, if backbenchers cannot force a change before tomorrow's vote, why do they still support the Government?  If the Cabinet cannot reinstate a Christmas bonus for pensioners, on what are Members voting?  Will the backbenchers make clear where they stand?  They either are silent lobby fodder or are in this House to represent their constituents' views.  If they cannot change this measure, what power do they have?  While the social conscience of the Fianna Fáil Party may be switched off, surely the backbenchers' political gut tells them this is wrong.  The choice for such backbenchers is simple.  They must change this proposal overnight or join with the Labour Party to vote against the savage cutting of the Christmas bonus.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_765">In its second emergency budget since it came to office, the challenge for the Government is to find the way out to perform one more U-turn.  For a Government that does so many U-turns, particularly on budgetary matters, this should not be difficult, especially as my colleague, Deputy Shortall, has given the Minister detailed argument as to how taking some interest relief from landlords would more than pay for and cover this cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The Holy Week emergency budget has been haunted by the ghost of Christmas future.  Removing the Christmas bonus will cancel Christmas for tens of thousands of pensioners, carers and others who have come to rely on it to supplement what are for the most part meagre and modest Christmases.  Many older people use the additional Christmas payment to buy presents for their grandchildren.  This is part of being an active citizen and yesterday I saw the former Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, launching the Bealtaine Festival that celebrates creativity in older people.  Everyone recognises that the active engagement of older people, and old age pensioners in particular, in plotting and planning small gifts for children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews constitutes a huge part of their social life from September onwards, when the pre-Christmas shopping season begins.  For many people, the Christmas bonus will put a turkey on the Christmas dinner table.  The Christmas bonus is a much-needed financial lifeline and not a frivolous bonus that is akin to not buying a Prada handbag because one has lost a couple of thousand euro in tax.  This issue is at the core of many people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">As for economic stimulus, Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate who commented on how he did not wish to see America go down the Ireland route, wrote about European economies recently and made the point that social welfare in European or social democratic economies constitutes an important form of economic stimulus because it keeps minimum levels of income and spending capacity in the economy in a manner that obviously does not happen in the United States.  While I do not know whether the Minister has conducted scientific studies in this regard, the vast bulk of the Christmas bonus is spent locally in local shops.  As my colleague, Deputy Shortall, has noted, this cutback could be paid for by restrictions on landlords' interest relief.  Much of the landlords' money goes abroad, whereas the pensioners spend the money in their local shops and with local businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Moreover, many pensioners will now take the train to the North to do their shopping there, to make whatever little savings they can.  The Minister may have seen the recently broadcast RTE "Prime Time" programme, which showed that for shopping which cost approximately £160 north of the Border, the equivalent cost for exactly the same items in a southern supermarket was approximately €280.  A pensioner who takes the train to the North probably can save the Christmas bonus equivalent by shopping there.  However, that is not what the Government wants to happen.  I have heard the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Fianna Fáil Ministers suggest that people might be patriotic by shopping locally and in the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I also was shocked when the Minister for Social and Family Affairs confessed recently that the control process in her Department to target social welfare fraud had collapsed for a time in the recent past.  The Minister acknowledged a loss of approximately €50 million in respect of the Department's long-standing fraud control procedures because the Government could not get its act together.  It took experienced social welfare staff, such as inspectors, from fraud control measures and put them to handling claims.  This is at a time when the Government tells us there are civil servants in various Departments who could be redeployed.  It seems an extraordinary act of bad management by the Minister that she should partially abandon control measures to the extent that she publically acknowledges, in parliamentary questions, and up to €50 million has been lost by the failure to continue routine and expert checking by social welfare inspectors in respect of deterring fraud and clarifying and confirming the identity of claimants.  It is astonishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I offer the following to the Minister as a way out of her difficulties.  If she takes an active interest in her Department and revisits the control measures, I predict she could make the savings and restore the Christmas bonus by that alone.  Just as we are talking about going after delinquent bankers and tax defaulters, we need to ensure there is no sense that social welfare fraud is being tolerated because inspections are being abandoned.  We have had enough of that on the tax side, where there has been a significant limitation on the number of inspections to deter tax fraud.  Claiming entitlements to which one is not entitled is a serious breach of the social contract and a cost to law-abiding taxpayers that they should not be asked to carry.  It undermines confidence in the social welfare system and in the tax system if Ministers acknowledge that control measures break down and that some people may be able to claim benefits to which they are not entitled.  Rather than relying on tip-offs about welfare fraudsters, the number of anti-fraud checks should be increased.  Like tax evasion, welfare fraud may have been acceptable during a time of economic plenty but we cannot allow social solidarity to be undermined by what people on very modest incomes paying many extra taxes and levies feel is being taken out of their pockets simply by the failure of competent management on the part of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">We have seen this Government row back on measure after measure in the past six months.  The bank guarantee was to be the cheapest in the world, at no cost to the Irish taxpayer.  That was followed by recapitalisation, then nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, a second recapitalisation and, as of yesterday, a third go at recapitalisation.  Some €3.5 billion was not enough for a bank that said it would die if it had to raise extra capital.  Yesterday, the Minister blithely announced an extra €1.5 billion for AIB.  The levy was first to be on all incomes but is now on incomes over €15,000.  The over-70s medical cards were to be withdrawn from all seniors but then they were not.  Following a question from my colleague, the leader of the Labour Party, the pension levy became tax deductible overnight.  The Government is full of examples of U-turns over the past eight months.  All the Minister has to do is put together a plan, as suggested by Deputy Shortall, by curbing tax relief on interest for landlords or going after social welfare fraud and then she can restore Christmas to pensioners, carers and to people who are long-term unemployed, and let them have that little bit of cheer at Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">Was it not a very cynical move to introduce such a measure at this time of the year, knowing it would not affect people until the winter?  It speaks volumes about how this Government treats older people that it did not have the guts to try this in December, during normal budgetary times, because if those who marched when the Government tried to take medical cards from the over-70s numbered thousands, they would be out in their hundreds of thousands during December.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">We now live in a society with a breakdown in the intergenerational solidarity that always sustained the communities in this country.  That a Government would take away an economic measure that gives comfort to older people, at a time when people spend extra on their families and themselves, was miserly and unbelievable.  No Fianna Fáil leader, such as Lemass or de Valera, would have countenanced such a move during their tenures.  It is a measure of how far right this Government has moved in distancing itself from the very people who would ordinarily have supported it.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The philosopher Bertrand Russell stated, "To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future".  This Government is increasingly isolating our older people, taking measures that are dumping people in nursing homes who cannot get nursing home subvention, putting older people into penury in respect of how they pay for care in their autumn and winter years and now the Government is taking away a measure that gave some small assistance to see them through the winter months.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Those who I represent are not upper middle class people living in urban conurbations.  They are living in rural areas, in older housing stock, have modest pensions and must have the fire lighting all day every day to keep the back boiler going to run the radiators to ensure there is heat in the house.  By reducing this payment, the Minister is telling us these people can pay for their heating costs but when they go to the community welfare officer to ask for a supplementary payment they will not be given it.  They would ordinarily have used the bonus to pay for the extra bag of coal or other such simple measures that sustained them through the hard winter months.  I ask the Minister to think of the intergenerational solidarity we always had in this country, the social solidarity to which previous Fianna Fáil Governments adhered, and I ask her to reverse this miserly, mean measure.  To introduce it at this time of the year, when it is not so high on the political agenda, is a cynical move.  It is symptomatic of the cynical politics that inhabit this country.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_776">I thank the Labour Party for sharing time and commend it on tabling this motion, which homes in on one nasty element of the recent emergency bankers budget.  I am not surprised it was not until after this debate had commenced that the Government could cobble together an amendment to it.  It is worth reading one paragraph of the amendment in which the Government "acknowledges that in the context of very tough decisions having to be made across the whole range of Government expenditure, the provision of €21.3 billion for social welfare services in 2009 — 20% more than the amount spent in 2008 — is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to protecting the vulnerable".  The focus of Government activity in recent years, certainly since September, has been on saving the banks and pumping taxpayers' money into the banking structure.  If the Government were serious about helping the vulnerable, one of its first actions would have been to ensure no more people would become unemployed by introducing policies which would deal with issues such as job retention and creation.  It is worth saying again that it is much easier for the Government to step in with measures to prevent job losses and retain jobs rather than having the current scenario of us just drifting along rudderless with no Government policy on job retention and creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I wish to cover a number of categories of people — if that is an acceptable term to describe anybody — in this proposal, including pensioners and lone parent families.  Ireland has the second highest rate of pensioner poverty in the EU and if there are any further cuts to welfare, elderly people will be plunged into deeper poverty.  Nearly nine out of ten older people could be at risk of poverty if welfare supports are cut in next December's budget, according to a warning by an alliance of non-government bodies.  Why should we be surprised at that?</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I will first consider the pensioners.  A great number of pensioners are struggling to make ends meet, although we know there is a percentage on the other side of this who have made reasonable pension provisions and who do not have those concerns.  A significant majority of pensioners will suffer greatly because of the withdrawal of the Christmas bonus.  The debate on this issue, since its announcement in the emergency bankers' budget a few weeks ago, has revealed people talking about taking Christmas away from pensioners, as well as Christmas presents.  The issue is not just about Christmas presents.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">This is about pensioners trying to get a few bob together in this bonus to pay the overhang which was discussed just a moment ago by one of my colleagues on the Labour benches.  For example, there is an issue regarding fuel.  I know many pensioners who have an overhang of a coal or gas bill and they depend at least partly on the Christmas bonus to clear up that loan.  In the winter, pensioners are colder and more vulnerable, with some surviving on very little food in order to try to keep themselves warm.  This withdrawal of a reasonable contribution to pensioners is mean-spirited in the extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The withdrawal will also lead to greater numbers of people ending up in hospital, leading to costs which are greater than any savings from the withdrawal of the payment in the first instance, even before we speak about additional crowding in hospitals and people spending more time on the infamous trolleys in accident and emergency units.  That would be most unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">It should be acknowledged that the payment could also help pay for a small Christmas present that a grandparent can buy for a grandchild who may have helped out by cutting the lawn over the course of the year, for example.  Such a small gesture is worthy of note and I am glad that it has been part of the debate on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I also wish to speak about the consequences for increasing loneliness because many pensioners will become very isolated as a result of this action.  Deputy Burton mentioned people who have significant income and decent pensions, who can choose between Prada handbags.  I do not know what such handbags would look like but maybe I am grateful for that.  I know that most pensioners' choices are more likely to be between the yellow pack on the supermarket shelf and the ordinary pack.  I have no doubt that significant numbers will have no option but to reach for the yellow pack.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">We are told the decreasing rate of inflation will be of significant assistance to these pensioners.  We all know that in the consumer price index, the biggest move in the measure of inflation has been in mortgage rates.  As a significant number of pensioners do not have mortgages, the benefit will not come to them easily.  It is unfair to use the inflation or deflation argument to justify this unjustifiable withdrawal of services as it will take a long time for that deflationary move to reach pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The budget was misleading and the Government amendment mentions the provision of 20% more expenditure for welfare payments.  This is a result of more people going on the dole.  If the Government had brought forward proper job retention policies, that would not be necessary and we would not have that additional expenditure.  It is not an increase in expenditure, as we know.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">It is important in this context to discuss the significant shift in wealth in this State that will take place under the proposed national asset management agency, NAMA.  This is not about shifting wealth from the wealthy to the poor, quite the opposite — it will be shifted from the poor to the wealthy.  It will cover the bankers and speculators as they were caught out, which is grossly unfair.  It is some Celtic tiger for pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Lone parents are more likely than any other social group to be living in poverty.  Data from the EU survey on income and living conditions conducted by the Central Statistics Office show that in 2006 alone, 33% of one-parent families were living in consistent poverty compared to 7% of the population as a whole.  Among the reasons lone parents are more likely to be poor are lower levels of educational attainment, with 47% of lone parents under 35 only having junior certificate level of education; the poverty trap, which makes it financially difficult to move from welfare to work; and low paying jobs or unemployment.  Lone parents who work are more likely to be in low-paying jobs, partly as a result of a lack of qualifications and partly because of the difficulty in accessing affordable child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I am sure every Member has experience of lone parent families coming to constituency offices.  Last week I dealt with a case where a woman had three children in primary school.  After she had paid all the other necessary expenses such as rent and essential bits and pieces for the house, she ended up with €40 per week to feed herself and her three children.  That amount of money would probably be spent on a round in the Dáil bar without so much as a thought yet that woman had just that to feed herself and children.  There are many other examples of that with which I have no doubt Members would be familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has moved to defuse the political time bomb by pledging to pay the social welfare Christmas bonus if there is a "windfall" in the Department's coffers or savings targets are exceeded.  Where would that windfall come from?  Would it come from bankers or speculators?  I think not.  The Minister's action was merely to throw a lifeline to the candidates of the Government parties who will go around the streets, roads and lanes of this State over the next few weeks to canvass in both the local government and EU elections.  Such candidates can argue that the cut may not happen as the Minister indicated that if there was a windfall the cut would not be effected.  It is a poor example.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I wanted to make a couple of other points but it is difficult to cram the issue into such a small time.  In all of its statements, the Government has indicated that we must protect the poor and look after those who most need it.  Yet most of the cuts and much political direction from the Government goes in the opposite direction.  When will this Government stand back and listen to organisations such as CORI in the propositions and suggestions they make?  When will this Government listen to those who are advocating for poor people and recognise the folly of its way, particularly regarding the circumstances we are discussing here, the withdrawal of the Christmas bonus?  It is wrong and should not happen.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_801">acknowledges that the Government will:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_802">reconsider the payment of the Christmas bonus as soon as we are out of the current economic situation;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_803">prioritise control activities to reduce the incidences of social welfare fraud to effect savings; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_804">continue to publicise the supports that are available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and to encourage people to contact them early before their debt problems accumulate.".</p>
          <p eId="para_805">In framing the recent budget, the Government was obliged to make a number of difficult decisions.  Those decisions were difficult because we were conscious of the fact that in raising taxes or cutting expenditure, we would have an impact on people's lives.  Nowhere is this more true than in respect of the social welfare budget.  The outcome of the budget has been to increase social welfare expenditure.  As a result, the social welfare budget will be €21.3 billion this year.  Unfortunately, the need for this increase has come about for the wrong reasons — namely, the rising numbers seeking jobseeker's assistance and jobseeker's benefit.  However, provision must be made in respect of these people.  Those who have lost their jobs are now the most vulnerable and they need our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The figure of €21.3 billion represents an increase of 20% on the allocation for last year.  At a time when Exchequer income is decreasing at a drastic rate, it was essential that not only should we try to increase that income but that we should also reduce expenditure.  To restore stability to the public finances, this meant we were obliged to do both.  As are result of our decision in this regard, expenditure cuts were made across all Departments.  However, the Department of Social and Family Affairs largely escaped the brunt of those cuts.  That is a sign of the Government's commitment to the most vulnerable.</p>

I said on the day of the budget that if there was any sort of windfall, this would be the one area the Government would like to reinstate by Christmas but I do not want to raise expectations.  We will continue with anti-fraud measures and controls with our normal four-pronged attack: prevention at the early stages, detection through review of claims in payment, deterrence of fraud and pursuit of those who have taken money they are not entitled to, either in error or deliberately, with prosecution where necessary.</p>

Social welfare inspectors are working in the Garda National Immigration Bureau in the airports to check people coming through.  Those measures are over and above the regular reviews of control and fraud.  It is crucial we continue to make savings in this area.  We have set ourselves a target of more than €580 million in savings to ensure we clamp down on fraudulent claims.  There are 600 staff in the Department working on control activities at local, regional and national levels.  Each of them, within their field of responsibility, is doing important work and criminal prosecutions are carried out.  By the end of last year 357 cases of social welfare fraud were forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  A further 328 cases were finalised in court last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">The message has clearly been sent out that we clamp down on fraud and we make savings.  We will continue to prioritise control savings within the Department so we do not have to make the type of difficult decisions we had to make in the last budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The dependence of people on social welfare payments was mentioned and I accept that.  There are people who are losing their jobs, lone parents, carers, pensioners or any of the other 1.2 million who receive a social welfare payment.  They have become dependent on those payments but it is opportune to note those payments have increased significantly over recent years.  I am not saying any of us would like to be living on them — far from it — but they are more generous payments than those in Britain or the rest of the EU.  In recent years child benefit has increased from €44 to €166 per month, the State contributory pension has grown from €113 a week to €230 a week and the weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance has risen from €93 to €204 per week.  Our commitment has been that in times when there has been sufficient funding, we have put it into social welfare to support the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Those are just the basic payments.  The secondary payments, such as household benefit, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement, free travel and other schemes which we never hear about, cost huge sums as well.  People say the Christmas bonus withdrawal will put pressure on the elderly when they are paying their heating bills but that is why in the last budget we increased the fuel allowance and increased the number of weeks for which it is payable.  Fortunately the price of fuel is falling substantially.  It is interesting that a third of all those who receive household benefit do not use all the electricity units.</p>

It is in place for them but they are not using it.  Perhaps I can encourage people not to be afraid to use what they have.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">The motion refers to the possibility that people might turn to moneylenders at Christmas.  There is not much evidence that there is a greater incidence of people turning to moneylenders, although I accept there is a danger it will happen at any time when people are vulnerable.  That is why the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, exists to give advice to people about budgeting.  More than 5,000 people have contacted MABS in person in the first three months of the year and more than 6,000 people have contacted the telephone helpline.  It is interesting that 90% of those who contact the helpline can now have their issue dealt with over the phone.</p>

There is also the context of the overall reduction in expenditure of €153 million in a total budget of €21.3 billion.  People who wish to be fair-minded about this recognise the huge demands that exist on the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Rather than cut the rates, the fairest way of dealing with it was to specifically examine an area——</p>

          <p eId="para_957">In my opinion, many people in receipt of social welfare benefit, be it supplementary welfare, disability benefit and so forth, would also recognise that the maintenance of their benefits is of the utmost importance to continue their way of living.  The fact that the Minister did not even consider a cut across the rates in itself demonstrates that the least possible pain has been inflicted in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">It is worth pointing out that €21.3 billion is provided for social welfare services in 2009, which is 20% more than the amount spent in 2008, yet there is little talk about it.  This shows a clear commitment to protecting the vulnerable and providing income support for the increasing number of people who are losing their jobs.  For years we implored various Ministers to increase carer's allowance, pensions and so forth.  That has been done, not just in good times but also in lean times.  This is the first time a Government has been confronted with the need to reduce the social welfare budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">It should be noted that over the past decade there have been significant increases in welfare benefits.  Child benefit has increased from €44 to €166 per month.  I am amazed that even when there are historic increases in welfare payments, there is little recognition of it or clamour about it.  The State contributory pension has increased from €113 to more than €230 per week.  Fair-minded people recognise that the Government has at all times been consistent and insistent on ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected.  A very important part of the budgetary strategy has been the increase in the rate of jobseeker's allowance from €93 to approximately €200 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Both taxes and borrowing had to be increased in the budget to pay for rising welfare expenditure.  The figures quoted by the Minister confirm the fact that the Government recognises the need always to support the welfare budget through the increases it has made.  We regret the fact that social welfare cuts had to be made but it is simply not possible to avoid them.  Even though Members on the Opposition benches have said the opposite, I have not heard any suggestion that we could have secured savings of €300 million anywhere else.</p>

          <p eId="para_979">I am pleased to support the Labour Party's Private Members' motion.  I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion as it reflects the anger felt by people in the community.  The eyes of the nation were on Leinster House on the day the budget was announced and people got a big fright when we reached the social welfare section and it was announced that the Christmas bonus was being taken away.  That will go down in history in the same way as Ernest Blythe's one shilling reduction in the pension in 1924.  How many times has that been thrown across the floor at this side of the House?  What the Government has done is equivalent to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">When one puts it in context, it is most unfair of the Government to take away the Christmas bonus from the unemployed and old age pensioners who have worked extremely hard.  At that time of year unemployed persons with young families plan to give their children the benefits of Christmas and to buy extra things for them.  I condemn the Government's action as unfair, unjust, cowardly and unkind.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">How can the Government preside over that mean action at a time when the HSE has an allocation of €1.4 million in bonus payments for executives and others in the health service who are running a deplorable service?  It is not possible for anybody on the Government side of the House to justify the cut because it is unfair.  The Government could have addressed other issues or sought reform in other areas.  The public service is crying out for reform yet there was nothing about that in the budget.  Instead, the Government resorted to the pensioners and those who could ill afford more cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">We should encourage those on the back to work and the back to education allowances who have travel and other expenses at a time when the economy is going through such difficulty.  We need people to access retraining and education.  We should encourage those people who have been forced onto the dole queues by the high cost economy this has proven to be.  I live in a constituency where jobs have been lost in three different areas in recent months.  People are being encouraged to go back to education or to retrain and it is of the utmost importance to encourage them.  It is unfair to cut a bonus at Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">In 1955 a predecessor of the Minister, the late Minister, Mr. Moran, was the first to introduce a double payment at Christmas time, albeit for a selective group.  If the Minister can tell social welfare recipients, especially old age pensioners, that times are worse now than in 1955 then the Government has failed to tell the public how deep is the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The Minister for Finance has made many changes to the budget to date and he blustered in regard to some of the mistakes he made but changes have taken place.  There is room for change.  There are suggestions in the motion as to where the Minister can find the money she needs.  Many other suggestions were made by other Opposition Members about where the funding could be found, but nobody had anticipated that the Government would again seek to make old age pensioners a soft target for further cuts given that they had already been hit in the October budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Everybody in the House, including the Minister, has probably received a letter from the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, the voice of the elderly.  It has been forced to put pen to paper in disbelief to express its concerns.  The Minister more or less made the excuse to the House tonight that some elderly people were so well off that they did not use the free fuel allowances allocated to them.  It is scraping the bottom of the barrel to use that as an excuse.  It is unbelievable that a Minister would make such a hurtful assertion.  I hope the Minister will change her mind on this measure before the Bill is implemented.  What is hurtful in April will be much more so next November prior to Christmas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_995">In the short few minutes remaining I wish to state that I am appalled that we have reached this juncture, coming as it does after the so-called Celtic tiger about which we boasted in this country.  Inside and outside this House, nationally and internationally, we have heard the mantra in recent years that we were the richest country in the world, the most powerful people in the world and people expected a great deal of us.  We would have expected a lot more from the Government in office than a punishment beating for the recipients of social welfare.  Bearing in mind that the Christmas bonus payment is for long-term social welfare recipients only, one should note that the number of people likely to be affected by the proposal is much greater than has been indicated to the House.  The pain and punishment likely to be inflicted on those who are vulnerable is considerable.  They are dependent on a payment and have budgeted for the year on the basis of receiving it but had no knowledge of what was coming down the tracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">Worst of all, the proposal is tempered by the threat by the Government that there is worse to come and that tough decisions must be made.  The theory is that if one experiences enough pain, it will solve the problem.  I have bad news for the Minister in this regard.  She knows the proposal in question is doing nothing for the economy, the recipients of social welfare or those who recently applied for social welfare payments.  The payment cut has only one objective; it is to compensate for the recalcitrance in recent years of those who did not do the job they were given to do or did not run the economy properly.  Like the Sheriff of Nottingham, the Government is now roaming the land punishing people at will for having the misfortune of having voted for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">The saddest point of all is that, unfortunately, people who are vulnerable, dependent on the State and watching the postman to ensure events occur when expected are now being told by the Government that the cut to the bonus was better than making a cut across the board.  They are told it is a punishment to be meted out to them and that the medicine is good for them.  They are told they will enjoy it later on because the sun may shine at some stage in the future, at which time the Government may be able to hand them back some of the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">This is a sad time and I do not know if the Minister is really <i>au fait</i>  with what is happening.  The real reason for the cuts is that the budget was short changed.  There was an insufficient Estimate to meet the requirements of the Department of Social and Family Affairs at the beginning of the year.  The €223 million the Minister will save will probably help to pay for the rent of the storage space for the e-voting technology.  It will go towards rent that, in some cases, will have to be paid for the next 20 years unless the machines are melted down or sold to another republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Sadly, as I have mentioned before in the House, the application of the habitual residency clause at present is appalling.  If a founding member of the main Government party were alive in this country today, having returned in the past two years, he would not qualify for a social welfare payment.  This is a sad reflection on our society.  The provision was made for one purpose, to which of course the Government will not admit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Consider the position of many people who were self-employed and self-sufficient but who now find themselves unemployed and dependent on social welfare.  It is humiliating and sad enough to have to line up and apply for social welfare and supplementary welfare but it is really awful when those doing so are led to believe they qualify for nothing.  This is not true.  They are entitled to a payment, be it a sickness allowance payment or unemployment assistance.  These are means-tested payments to which they are entitled and there should be no obstacles to their receiving them provided they meet the requirements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">Politics is about choices and it is undoubtedly true that the choices made not by the Minister opposite, Deputy Hanafin, but by the previous Government, were very significant contributors to the financial predicament in which the present Government now finds itself.  It is abundantly clear that the choices made today are the mirror image of those that led us into this difficulty.  The current Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, was a cheerleader for the construction industry.  Tax incentives were created which threw petrol on a fire that was already burning out of control.  This ethos was best summarised by former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who said in respect of the e-voting machines that €50 million was but small change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">When the Minister of Social and Family Affairs stands up without a script, there is always a danger the mask will slip.  She stated in respect of the bonus that it is only a couple of hundred euro to the recipients.  I almost expected the Marie Antoinette of Cabinet to say, "Let them eat cake."  The couple of hundred euro represents Christmas for the recipients.  The chauffeur-driven Minister in her ivory tower operates mostly from a script but unfortunately walked into the mire this evening without one, thus exposing the real philosophy underlying the Government's approach.  It is abundantly clear that the Government has nailed its colours to the mast.  When the proverbial hits the fan, the Government stands four-square behind all those who led us into this debacle, the banks and the developers——</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">I want to localise the issues and refer to my constituency.  In the Macroom social welfare office, 664 people were signing on in March 2008.  There are now 1,473 doing so, representing an increase of 121%.  In the Newmarket office, where 660 people were signing on in March 2008, there are now 1,844 doing so, representing an increase of 179%.  Many of these people are forced to experience the indignity of standing in queues in rain and inclement weather and are being forced to wait many weeks before obtaining their entitlements.  Included among these are many from the agricultural community who, by virtue of the collapse in the agriculture sector, now qualify for a farm assist payment.  Why does the Government fail to recognise the position on the €230 million, which I accept is a lot of money in difficult times?  It must not be spirited out of the country to offshore bank accounts but spent on regenerating local economies.  The problem with many of the analyses carried out by the Government and outside commentators on the economic difficulties is that they all focus on the macro level.  We need to focus on local economies and communities.  The money in question would drive these.  I wish the Marie Antoinette of Cabinet would take into account these matters.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1006">When the budget was delivered by the Minister for Finance, the abolition of the Christmas bonus stood out clearly.  Did the Government consult its backbenchers on this?  It is effectively taking what could amount to €200 from social welfare recipients.  The Minster for Social and Family Affairs is focusing on soft targets.  Did she make the decision on the bonus herself or was it made collectively by the Cabinet?  When she was considering savings with her officials, did she decide to opt to abolish the Christmas bonus?</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The cut affects the most vulnerable, including those in receipt of the disability allowance, jobseeker's allowance, deserted wives' benefit, carer's allowance and the lone-parent allowance.  The Minister should consider what will happen to them at Christmas.  In my constituency of Limerick East, the cut will affect the most vulnerable.  In many cases, they are living in sub-standard accommodation and paying considerable electricity and fuel bills over the winter months just to keep warm.  The Christmas bonus contributed towards these bills.  The money is not saved by the recipients but spent on necessities, including food, clothing, fuel and children's Christmas presents.  I have racked my brain and cannot understand why the Minister considered the cut to be legitimate.  She should think about people's needs in the approach to Christmas.  The bonus represents a considerable amount of money to the recipients.</p>

          <p eId="para_1010">The Minister is hitting a growing group.  People who are currently on jobseeker's benefit will be going on to jobseeker's allowance by Christmas.  People who will have been drawing on their PRSI benefits will be going on to long-term unemployment.  Consider it in the overall context of what we are putting into the banks.  We already have put €7 billion into the two main banks and we are looking at a potential further €1.5 billion.  We are looking at coming up with funding in all of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">This is another defining moment.  Who are we elected to represent?  We are elected to ensure the economy works well and to look after the most vulnerable.  In one fell swoop the Minister has defined what this Government is about.  It is about the quick fix.  They are so long in Government and so far removed from what is happening on the ground that they do not understand the impact, or if they do, it is extremely callous in terms of the effect on ordinary people in their daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">In the budget debate I said to the Taoiseach that the Government will have to reverse this decision.  I wait to see how the Government's backbenchers will vote on this tomorrow.  They will probably be fully aware of the impact of this on the lives of ordinary people, on the lone parent who is trying to buy toys for her children at Christmas and on the elderly person living in a damp drab apartment in terms of heating bills.  I hope this will be reversed and I expect it will have to be.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_1013">I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to the Social Welfare Bill on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Deputy Creed quoted a sentence from the Minister, Deputy Hanafin's, speech but he never finished the sentence.  He quoted what suited him, which is an old trick in parliamentary debate.  I listened to the debate and the Minister stated that a couple of hundred euro did not seem much but it was enormous to the person who got it.  She said that from the bench where the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, now sits.  Of course somebody had told Deputy Creed to use a glib Marie Antoinette name tag and in his rush to get to use it, he quoted half her sentence deliberately and left half of it unsaid deliberately, in which case of course it appeared uncaring.  It is an old mean trick and I thought Deputy Creed was up to more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">We are debating Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill and a welfare bill which has increased by 20% from 2008 to 2009.  One of the Sinn Féin Deputies stated the Bill was miserly and niggardly.  How can one call a 20% increase in social welfare expenditure niggardly and miserly just like that?  This also is completely erroneous and of course it does not stand up to scrutiny whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Often on radio programmes such as Sam Smyth's "The Sunday Supplement" or "The Marian Finucane Show", a pundit or an Opposition politician says the money was squandered, and yet nobody can ever say where it should not have been spent.  There were year on year increases in social welfare.  Was that money squandered?  I do not think so.  I was at Cabinet between 1997 to 2002 and every year the emphasis was on us wanting to give more, and how much more could be given each year to OAPs and in child benefit, which used to be called children's allowance.  Each year increases far beyond the rate of inflation were given to welfare recipients, who well deserved it.  It was given, that is the point.  When people shout squander mania and that the money was all lost and squandered, do they mean old age pensions should not have risen from €113 to over €230?  Do they mean child benefit should not have risen from €44 to €166 per month?  Do they consider that squander mania?</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">In the past two weeks, in particular, I have been in many households in which parents — lone parents in many cases — have said strongly that they were thankful child benefit was not touched.</p>

She stated it could come from anywhere really, but there should have been far more, that there should not have been all these levies, and it should be taken from the spending.  Is it not jolly to be in the position where one can say more money should be taken but never state where it is to be got or what is to be put to one side if one takes more money?  It is quite hilarious really and most irresponsible of people.</p>

He replied he did not know where he would have got the money, and asked how would he know that.  All he knew was it should not have been as it was.  It all shows an extraordinary lack of responsibility or forethought before Fine Gael rushes in to make decisions as to what it says.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">This Bill is dealing with an increase of 20% in the social welfare budget.  I would like to know where the Opposition believes cuts should have been introduced.  Last year, there were generous increases of 3% in social welfare payments which many believed would not happen.  It behoves us all, however, as the Minister said, to ensure value for the moneys spent.  Various precautionary measures have been put in place to unearth social welfare fraud and ensure that those who need it most get most.  That is the essence of social welfare.  It is about giving to those who do not have.  Significant numbers of people in this economy can be described as "have nots".  For a public representative to demand all sorts and yet never explain where they expect it to come from, is, in my mind, reprehensible.  It is not suitable to us public representatives as public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">The Minister spent much time working on the details of her Estimates and where best she could use the moneys she had been given.  These are generous moneys, given by the taxpayers.  They know in their hearts they are giving it to those who most need it and the most vulnerable in society.  In so doing they are fulfilling their social justice thrust.</p>

          <p eId="para_1050">I am happy to record the Government has given an increase of 20% in the social welfare budget in less than a year.  Long may this continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">If one was to accept Deputy O'Rourke's claim of a 20% increase in the social welfare budget, one would imagine it applied to every social welfare allowance.  Deputy O'Rourke, however, has not recognised the significant increases in unemployment rates across the country.  The greater proportion of the budget increase, other than the 3.8% provided in the October budget, is going towards unemployment allowances.  For the Deputy to make such a statement and walk away from it, leaving it unexplained, is part of the Government sides' spin on the current economic circumstances to which we have become accustomed in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Earlier, the Minister said in the context of the current economic circumstances, it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure to restore stability to the public finances.  However, if there were a plan to stabilise the public finances, the recent demeaning statements by a US economist about the Irish economy would not have been made.  I accept some cuts had to be made to make some effort to tackle the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">The tragedy, however, is that the Government can see no other way to stabilise the public finances other than hitting workers and taxpayers.  I am not referring to high income workers but those with incomes as low as €15,000 per annum, those earning the minimum wage.  Deputy O'Rourke claims there is no other alternative but it is obvious she had not listened to the Fine Gael Deputy Leader and finance spokesperson who outlined an alternative budget in this Chamber in which the majority of necessary savings could have been found by elimination of waste in and reform of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">While the Minister claims there has been a 20% increase in the social welfare budget, she does not realise that this has gone towards payments in the unemployment blackspots across the country, particularly in the west.  The main concern of most of those who have contacted me about this Bill is about becoming homeless.  Many organisations which help the disadvantaged are concerned about the capping and reduction of rent supplements.  The Government has again taken the soft option of reducing the cap on rent supplement to save X amount.  The reality is that rent allowance recipients, already at their wits' ends, will have to top up their payments.  In a Department of Social and Family Affairs context, this can be seen as an illegal top-up.  Does the Minister want to see an increase in homelessness?  I hope this provision in the Bill will be amended on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">The replacement of the early child care supplement with a free preschool year would have been fine in the good times.  However, where is the educational infrastructure to safely accommodate these extra children?  What about the supervisory and educational personnel for this scheme?  Will they be trained? We are concerned here with a number of people who will have to go into a new situation dealing with the children.  There are dangers involved in this provision if it is only half thought out, as I believe it is, and it will come home to haunt the Minister unless it is done properly.  I do not believe it can be achieved in a proper manner in such a short time.  I hope the Minister will address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">It is deplorable that the Minister saw fit to reduce the early child supplement by half until the end of the year and to totally abolish it thereafter.  That payment has been important, particularly to single parents who are on very tight budgets, but the Minister has decided that from January it is to be eliminated altogether.  That is a very serious step.  Tragically, I am sure there will be a very serious fallout from that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Everybody welcomed the additional funding that was made available to FÁS for training places and further education.  However, we cannot say we will do that and at the same time have an embargo on recruitment, particularly for trainers.  I will give one example.  Tragically, 198 jobs were recently lost at Sigma in Loughrea.  To be fair to FÁS, it immediately came on site and provided for training for some of the employees as they became redundant.  However, I was told only last week that FÁS will no longer be able to recruit trainers for the remaining people who are leaving work and who could avail of further training on the premises.  It cannot do so because of the embargo on recruitment.  As I have said to various Ministers, there should be a derogation in the case of recruitment of trainers in FÁS, which is delivering a very important service that cannot be delivered without properly trained people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1060">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this latest Social Welfare Bill.  The Government through this Bill continues to attack the families of Ireland.  The very people who were left untouched by the Celtic tiger era are now being hit by the savage cuts in social welfare contained in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I look forward to voting against the Bill for the following reasons.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I find it very difficult to support the non-payment of the Christmas bonus, which was raised by the Labour Party earlier.  The sheer meanness of this measure is incredible as this money means much to families during the festive season.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The Government is asking citizens to take pain on behalf of the country in order to ensure a proper future for the next generation.  What is it that the Government is actually doing?  What did it do today, for example?  Seven junior ministers were removed from Government with a reported golden parachute of €53,000 each.  Government backbenchers use phrases such as "Let them try to take it off me" in regard to the long-service payments.  We have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance using words, phrases and semantics in trying to wriggle their way out of a stated intention in regard to the double payments to Oireachtas Members.  How can a Government such as this have any credibility when its members steadfastly refused to lead by example?  It is another classic example of the Government following the philosophy of "do as I say but not as I do".  It is very interesting to compare this scenario with the position of a person who is looking forward to getting a Christmas bonus that will not arrive this year.  It is a damning indictment of the Government and all the Deputies who comprise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The plan to reduce rent to landlords under the rent supplement scheme is a proper and sensible move.  However, the implementation of this policy shows just how detached the Government and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs are.  To quote the Minister, the "expectation" on landlords to automatically reduce rents is totally unrealistic.  It is not happening.  It has been my experience in County Clare in recent months that in terms of both business and private rented accommodation, landlords are happy to sit on the property.  They are not willing to budge and are charging the same rents to businesses and individual tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The responsibility for renegotiating rents should not be placed on tenants and should be provided for by community welfare officers or staff of the Department itself.  The State must take on the responsibility in that area.  For years, the only requirement was to hand out money, which is what has got us into the situation we have today.  Much of the responsibility rests with the State and its agents to ensure that what they spend represents proper value for money but this is not incorporated in the Bill.  If the community welfare officers or someone from the Department was made responsible for delivering better value for money, this would work better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The squeeze on middle income earners is an issue the Government will eventually rue.  We have passed the psychological barrier of 50% of income returning to the Government, and a family may now have to contribute 51% to the Exchequer.  Some 41% will go in income tax, 4% in PRSI, 4% on the health levy and 2% on the income levy, which serves to disincentivise people in employment.  The Government cannot continue to squeeze this sector and not expect a fall-off in economic productivity and activity.  The possibility of this being further compounded by additional taxes on property and the reintroduction of third level fees next year would indicate that people will not be able to tolerate this approach any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The equation is very simple.  There were two aspects to this budget, namely, to increase the Government's income and to deliver value for money in how public services are provided.  The Government chooses to ignore the second part of that equation.  This is ultimately unsustainable and will have to be dealt with sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The scrapping of the early child care supplement and the hasty introduction of the 38-week free preschool support bears all the hallmarks of the Minister for Transport's proposed introduction of five penalty points for not having an NCT certificate for one's car in that it is badly conceived and not properly planned.  It remains to be seen if the places are available or will become available but I do not believe they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The Department is to a large extent depending on the voluntary sector in regard to child care provision.  The vast majority of the funding under the national child care investment programme, NCIP, has been used by the voluntary sector.  This sector once again steps up to the plate in order to provide a service that has been ignored by the Government.  These are the very same people who also feel the new pressures from the Government in regard to their jobs, mortgages and careers yet they are now expected to take up the slack.  I suspect this 38 week free preschool is just a sop.  The Government should look more closely at its subvention programme for child care facilities.  This scheme is cumbersome and unwieldy, and needs reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">At this point the Government should not tinker with the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance.  In their current form these schemes are restrictive and the Bill's proposals do little to facilitate people who want to avail of them.  Both schemes offer the opportunity for motivated people to improve their circumstances yet the Government chooses to place many obstacles in the way of potential participants.  These schemes should be more responsive.  There is an obvious benefit that could accrue to the individual and the State if the schemes could be operated in a more responsive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">It is critical that Government policy seeks to minimise the duration for which people are unemployed.  Long-term inactivity diminishes work skill and makes re-employment more difficult.  It is vital, therefore, that access to education, training and employment programmes is enhanced so that barriers to employment are removed.  In County Clare, for example, unemployment has soared to almost 10,000 people.  Dole queues have increased fivefold.  Unemployment in Ennis has increased by 81% in the past 12 months alone.  The potential for the economic cancer of long-term unemployment taking hold in Ireland is becoming more of a reality.  The Bill does nothing to tackle this issue and will only add further to our drastic unemployment problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The Bill will have a devastating impact on middle income families and represents a savage attack on low income families.  The ordinary people are waiting in the long grass for the Government.  I do not know what doors Deputy O'Rourke is knocking on, but I am knocking on completely different doors.  The people are waiting in the long grass to run the Government out of office.  This is a shocking Bill and the Minister will pay the price for it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_665">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_1072">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Clearly we are in difficult and challenging economic times.  The decisions we will need to make will be very difficult but they will need to be made.  Of course it is never easy to take money away from people or reduce their income, but that will need to be done across the board, because we need to make ourselves more competitive in a global context.  We are not doing it just for ourselves.  We are doing it to ensure that other countries, international markets and international political institutions realise that Ireland can and will make the difficult decisions.  While geographically we might be an island, politically and economically we are not.  We export 80% of all we produce.  Our relationship with other countries is vital and their perception of us is vital.  With this budget the Government has grasped the nettle.  As has been said it will be the first of five difficult budgets with four more to come.  It will not get any easier in the short term.  It could be said that if we do not take the unpleasant medicine now we will be taking much more unpleasant medicine for significantly longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">There are a number of aspects to the Bill, one of which relates to rent supplement.  As it stands 84,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, which is a very large number of people.  That rent supplement provides support for those for whom local authority housing is not an option in the short term.  It also acts as an umbrella for those at risk of homelessness.  A previous speaker mentioned that landlords would be happy to sit on their flats or apartments without having tenants and getting rent.  I do not believe that is the case.  Landlords with property will want to rent it out.  They are pragmatic and if that means they will be renting it out at a reduced rate, they will do so.  They certainly become more pragmatic when the banks are chasing them down looking for their payments.  Landlords will not happily refuse to reduce rents and have a vacant flat rather than getting some level of income, albeit somewhat reduced.  An occupied flat with an income coming through is the likely result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Like other Deputies, I have received a number of e-mails stating that the reduction in rent supplement should not lead to homelessness.  It is exaggerating to suggest that this measure would lead to homelessness — I do not believe it will.  There may be individual cases where landlords refuse to reduce the rent.  However it is not beyond the wit of man, the local authorities or social welfare to deal with the consequences of a few belligerent landlords.  The State should not be held to ransom to line the pockets of a few landlords who do not believe they should move with the times and reduce rent.  Landlords are pragmatic and will reduce rents when it is put to them.  The State is spending more than €490 million on rent supplement and it is vital that we get value for money.  It is necessary for us to cut our cloth to measure.  Landlords cannot be allowed to get away with charging high rents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Today I spoke to private tenants who are moving from a very small flat with two single bedrooms.  They had a contract from over a year ago and were being charged more than €1,500 for that flat.  They are taking their time in moving because there is a significant reduction by landlords in the rents they are charging.  They are looking at a large two-bedroom apartment in a very nice area in the docklands in my constituency of Dublin South-East which is available at €1,100.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">There is, therefore, a significant saving.  I see no reason the State should not benefit from a reduction in rents, particularly when costs across the economy are reducing.  I see no reason that some landlords should try to hold onto the higher rents or imply they might make people homeless.  They should not be allowed get away with that.  The State cannot base its legislation on being held to ransom by such landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Another aspect of the Bill is the imaginative and innovative proposal to provide a free preschool year for children.  The early child care supplement that preceded this cost the State €480 million in 2008.  We must cut our cloth to measure and ensure that we get value for money.  The early childhood care and education scheme does this in an innovative way.  There has been much discussion about the loss to families caused by the loss of the supplement.  It seems to me that does not focus on the purpose of the exercise, namely, care for children, as evident from the term "child care".</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">The scheme will benefit parents who would otherwise have paid for this service.  It will also benefit disadvantaged children whose parents would not be in a position to pay for their attendance at preschool.  The scheme also safeguards jobs in a sector that is likely to be hit hard by the economic downturn.  Most facilities have small margins and low pay and are very vulnerable to a reduction in the number of parents who send their children to child care facilities following a reduction in their incomes.  Therefore, we are bringing about value for money with this innovative scheme.  This is something the Children's Rights Alliance welcomes.</p>

He said that instead of getting a universal preschool system for €136 million a year, which was the NESC costing, we were spending €406 million on a private system that did not work and that, therefore, there was a simple test for the Minister for Finance’s first budget.  If it contained a commitment to scrap the early child care supplement and to create a universal preschool system, we had intelligent government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">If Members have a difficulty with what Fintan O'Toole said, they should raise the issue with him.  I was interrupted when I said he said that if we had the commitment, we had intelligent government.  He went on to say we could therefore expect to see a similar approach in other areas.  I think that is true.  We can expect to see a similar approach and innovative decisions being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The Labour Party's most recent policy document on child care and preschool education dates back to approximately 2005 and probably needs some dusting down.  That document argued for an early year's care subsidy that would cost over €1 billion per annum and also wanted a year of preschool education costing €163 million per annum.  When those documents are dusted down, the Labour Party will realise our current proposal is a good and innovative scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">A significant number of community child care facilities are in place.  For example, not far from here we have the St. Andrew's Resource Centre and the centre at City Quay.  These provide an excellent service for young people and have given a broad welcome to this proposal.  We have yet to see the detail, but if people try to work with the proposal we will see positive results.  The recent National Competitiveness Council report on education and training suggests that pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education, as it leads to improvements in students' skill levels, motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raise the private and social returns from all future investments in their education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The scheme, therefore, is about ensuring that children get care at an early stage.  People from disadvantaged areas or areas where children are at risk of becoming involved in antisocial behaviour often say they spotted this when a child was as young as three years old.  We need intervention when the child is that age.  This scheme is part of early intervention and of ensuring that children get a good start in life so that they are well prepared to go into more formal education later.  The real winners from this scheme will be the more disadvantaged and marginalised children in society who do not currently benefit from preschool care and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance have welcomed this scheme.  In a debate on the issue, the Children's Rights Alliance asked what costs more, maintaining and developing early years education or not doing so at all.  For every euro spent on early years education, a return of up to €7.10 can be expected.  Investing in such education has proved effective in the long run in terms of promoting social skills, improving the life chances of children born in disadvantaged communities and reducing criminal activity.  What could be a smarter investment?  These comments were made on Thursday, 2 April and the situation has not changed since.  We must give our children the best chance in life that we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">For a child brought up in a chaotic family, going to child care providers might be a respite.  We used to send my two children to pre-school for three hours per day.  It was beneficial for them because they learned how to socialise and about boundaries.  It prepared them for primary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">I welcome the Bill.  The reduction in the rent supplement is good, as it will ensure that landlords cannot hold the Government and the economy to ransom.  I happily support the Bill, which is imaginative and clever governance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1110">We have now had four budgets in less than nine months, as many as the Minister for Finance's predecessor had in four years.  At around this time last year, Deputy Brian Lenihan had the misfortune to become the Minister for Finance, as he claimed himself.  We had his first step last August, then some premature efforts in October last, followed by the pension levy and now this "hole in the bucket" budget.  The Government might claim this is a worldwide problem, but no other Minister for Finance has needed to present four budgets in nine months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">In my speech to last October's budget, I quoted Winston Churchill, who said: "We contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle".  Every person knows that, after the Government reduces their incomes in this budget, they will need to cut their expenditure to match their incomes, particularly those in receipt of social welfare payments.  Last weekend in Bantry, a small business man told me that if his sales go down, he does not increase his prices.  Instead, he tries to cut his costs.  What the Government attempted in this budget did not do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The Minister for Finance claimed that his budget was based on six essential steps.  He stated that he wanted to stabilise our public finances.  He has made four attempts and has only succeeded in increasing the debt placed on every man, woman, child and grandchild.  He stated that we must restore our damaged banking system, but giving it more money will not be a cure.  The taxpayer needed to bail AIB out of its ICI difficulties at a cost of £400 million or nearly €500 million.  The AIB DIRT tax settlement was £90 million while that for Bank of Ireland was £30.5 million.  In the Faldor scandal, AIB executives were fined over €320,000 by the Revenue Commissioners.  What of the losses racked up by John Rusnak of almost $700 million for AIB, nearly 20% of the amount that we, the taxpayers, have invested in AIB?  Does the Government remember AIB's scandalous overcharging of €34.2 million on foreign exchange transactions and €8.6 million on every other type of account?  AIB settled a £1 million overdraft with the late Mr. Haughey in mysterious circumstances.  In 2004, the chief executive of Bank of Ireland resigned overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">I was not surprised when, on researching this subject, I read, not from the last century but from the one before, that in 1885, the Munster Bank failed due to mismanagement and fraud and was liquidated.  Out of the ashes, the Munster and Leinster Bank commenced operations.  Eventually, it became the largest of the three banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The Minister for Finance placed €1,651 of capital investment in AIB and Bank of Ireland on behalf of every man, woman and child.  In his budget, he proposed to underwrite a further €90 billion of developers' debt to secure these banks.  How much more does he intend to put into this bucket full of holes while cancelling the Christmas bonus to old age pensioners, on which the Deputies opposite must vote tomorrow?</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">I propose that the boards of the banks might, as a gesture of contrition and gratitude for the €100 billion that the taxpayer has put up to bail them out of their mess, sponsor the Christmas bonus.  I call on those appointed by the Minister for Finance to table such a motion at board level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The Minister also stated that he wanted to protect jobs by investing €50 million per year over two years.  This is the cost of approximately 2,400 unemployed people, approximately the same number of people who have lost their jobs in the past two weeks.  Will this tiny effort be targeted at, for example, the unemployed turf accountants?  In the Minster's efforts to support and stimulate economic confidence, he proposed assistance to second-hand car dealers with their tax liability.  Arthur Daly, that infamous car dealer, would be proud of him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">What did the budget do to stimulate economic growth?  Did it do anything to stimulate employment or promote tourism or agriculture?  Did it do anything for those on social welfare?  The agricultural community suffered a 17% reduction in the REPS 4 scheme, an 8% reduction in forestry premiums and the abandonment of the fallen animal and farm retirement schemes and the farm installation grant.  Did the budget do anything for the people of west County Cork?</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The Government has been found out and the people know what it did to them.  They are going to do the same to it.  I do not see a soft landing for those on the Government benches.  Their days are numbered, unlike their management of the public finances.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_1119">This Bill could be more aptly described as the "Hanafin Anti-Welfare Bill 2009".  It is an exercise in removing essential allowances for low and middle income families.  To make good the gaping hole in the Exchequer caused by blatant Government squandering and mismanagement of the country's public purse, the Minister for Finance has once again hit those least able to bear the brunt.  This is evident on doorsteps throughout the country.  The Government should be ashamed of how it is treating the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Since the emergency budget, the Government has shown itself to be out of touch with the reality of people's lives.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance seem incapable of singing from any hymn sheet other than the one that advocates screwing the low and middle income groups so far into the ground that the life blood is squeezed out of them while leaving the high earners relatively unscathed.  I was sickened and outraged to hear Deputy O'Rourke supporting the screwing of the poor and the less well off, many of whom are in our constituency of Longford-Westmeath, which probably has the country's highest unemployment rate.  Since this time last year, Longford-Westmeath's unemployment figure has increased by more than 88%.  This shows how out of touch she is with the realities of the constituency that she was supposedly elected to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">In 1988, Margaret Thatcher stated, "I believed passionately that the Government should never have too much power because if you give them too much power they meddle in everything, make a mess of it and make wrong judgments."  That is what is happening with the present Government.  This country is suffering from the effects of a Government that has been in office too long, is too committed to cronyism and is too wrapped up in the trappings of power to see the plight of the ordinary worker.  It is a Government that has fallen into every trap of crisis management and is compounding one mistake with another as it tries to run for cover at every opportunity.  It is digging a hole for itself as I speak and the electorate will testify to that on 5 June next.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Mrs. Thatcher's words are extremely apt when one thinks of the fall-out since the 2009 budget last October and the compounding of the problem with the latest emergency budget.  It is shameful that low-income earners, such as those on €15,000 per annum, are subject to a 2% income levy by a heartless Government showing how out of touch it is with the ordinary man and woman in the street.  Moreover, low-income earners on €25,000 will be further hit with the doubling of the health levy to 4%.  What form of anti-poverty strategy is this?  So much for promises to protect those who are at risk of poverty or are below the poverty line.  The Government is doing absolutely nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">In an extremely anti-child and parent budget, the early child care supplement and child benefit have come under severe attack.  Child benefit is the bread and butter for many parents who find the current economic crisis hard to cope with.  For many women,  the loss of child care benefit will prevent them from working outside the home as they will not be able to afford child care.  This will increase the risk of poverty.  I again ask whether Deputy O'Rourke understands that moves to tax or means test child benefit will pit woman against woman in terms of opportunity and will open the doors to wider social inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Every day in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, I see at first hand the lack of regard the Government has for children and their parents.  In a move calculated to leave hard-working and hard-pressed parents without help in caring for their physically disabled children, the Health Service Executive, HSE, is closing Teach Solas, the Longford respite centre and handing it over to an outside agency.  Many of the workers and parents received notification to this effect yesterday.  What reward is this for parents who save the State millions by looking after their children at home and deserve and need the chance of a break while their children are being looked after by dedicated staff in such a facility?  What has happened in this regard constitutes shameful and disgraceful carry-on by the Government.  Were this to happen in Russia or other countries, Members would condemn them for so doing.  However, I am sorry to state that this is taking place in the heartland of Ireland.  These parents now are angry and frustrated and fear that the new service provider will enforce charges for this care, which they urgently need for their children.  I am disappointed with the Minister who I thought was a more caring Minister who was more in tune with issues in respect of women, children and those who work in a voluntary capacity in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">How can the Government justify the cruel withdrawal of the Christmas bonus for the most vulnerable in our society?  The pressure on low-income families during the festive season is unbearable.  Without the additional help of the bonus, many will be unable to withstand the commercial pressure.  Older people, many of whom live alone in fuel inefficient houses, will be colder and poorer next winter unless this heartless decision is reversed.  Even Charles Dickens could not have envisaged a Government policy that would, Scrooge-like, take a little Christmas cheer from those in poverty, while avoiding hitting the well-off with measures such as reduced tax relief on private pensions.  In effect, the elimination of the bonus is akin to a 2% cut to the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The crumb of hope held out by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that the Christmas bonus will be restored if there is a windfall in the Department's coffers is akin to holding out a straw to a drowning man or woman.  According to John Curry, social policy is defined as: "Those actions of government which deliberately or accidentally affect the distribution of resources, status, opportunities and life chances among social groups and categories of people within the country and thus help to shape the general character and equity of its social relations". The Celtic tiger served to make the rich richer and those who never benefited from the boom years now are being forced to pick up the tab of the Galway tent cronies and champagne guzzlers who still exist within the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_693">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_1127">The two main elements of the Social Welfare Bill 2009, namely, the doubling to 4% of the health levy and to 2% of the income levy, will have a severe impact on low-income and middle-income families.  People earning less than €15,000 per annum will be subject to the income levy.  In other words, those who earn the minimum wage or less will be brought into the tax net, while those earning more than €25,000 will face the doubling of the health levy.  These measures come from a Government that claims to be protecting low earners and those who are at risk of poverty.  However, the impact of both levies certainly will ensure poverty will visit many doors on foot of its introduction in less than two weeks' time on 1 May.  As I noted, these two aspects of the Bill are extremely disappointing and Fine Gael certainly will not support and will vote against these elements of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">I wish to tease out matters pertaining to the early child care supplement.  The Minister stated in her contribution that it will be replaced by the preschool provision and this already has raised serious questions about how it will be implemented.  In general, the early child care supplement was perceived as a means of paying for child care for women who were working.  I acknowledge it was available to women regardless of whether they were at home or in the workplace but the €20 per week was highly valuable.  While I support preschool and acknowledge getting children to school early has a value, I would not replace one with the other.  A mother with a six-month old baby who wishes to work will not receive any support from the State until the child is eligible for preschool, assuming the Government will implement its proposals, which I cannot envisage being in place before January.  However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt in this regard.  However, the supplement of €20 per week has been highly important to people, especially those with two or three young children.  It constitutes a very important contribution towards child care.  The cost of child care has not gone away.  It still is a major issue for people who are on low to middle incomes.  It comprises a major chunk of their take-home pay and the impact of this measure on parents of young families, combined with that of the levies, will be significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The Government should reconsider this decision because the supplement is of relatively recent introduction and has been of benefit to working parents.  There always was an expectation or hope it would increase rather than being abolished.  The parents of young children in child care will always require support because while the costs are not excessive, it is an expensive product in respect of the regulations that must be adhered to, the cost of premises, the staff-child ratio and so on.  These elements add to the cost and many of those running crèche or child care facilities constantly work to keep charges down.  They work with parents to ensure the latter can see where the monthly payment is spent.  I have spoken to many people on this issue in the past three weeks.  There is a consensus that this will drive child care into the black economy.  People will not be able to afford to use a crèche and will depend on relatives if they are lucky enough to be in that situation.  The crèche, which can be expensive, will not be an option for many.  I ask the Government to hold its fire on the early child care supplement.  It will have a severe impact on working parents of young children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">I appeal to the Minister, who was in the Chamber earlier, to examine rent supplement and, with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, to work with local authorities to advance the rental accommodation scheme.  It is of great value to tenants and those on local authority housing schemes.  It gives security to tenants and there is much property at the moment for which this scheme could be advanced.  It is a matter of providing the staff and resources at local authority level to ensure the product on offer is advanced.  The scheme gives security to the tenant, who is dealing with a local authority, and the standard of accommodation has been improved.  It has been a success and people are happy with it.  It is not moving as quickly as it would if resources were made available.  There is so much accommodation available to local authorities.  It is an attractive proposition for landlords, who are guaranteed rent for 12 months or three or four years depending on the arrangement.  It is a useful product and I appeal to the Minister to work with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and local authorities to ensure it is advanced.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1133">I propose to share time with Deputy Morgan.  It is appalling that the Government has not provided speakers for the slot allocated to it.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, for whom I have the greatest respect and whose presence I welcome.  It is a terrible indication of a lack of concern.  Even as many Government Deputies will be whipped into coming into the Chamber and voting for Second and Subsequent Stages of this Bill, they will hear from the people affected by the proposals at their constituency clinics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">I have a particular view on social welfare, which I wish to address first in order to be consistent.  The background to this Bill is the crisis in the public finances, the collapse of a revenue base that was excessively reliant on transactions in the property market, which in turn had been grossly exaggerated by bad regulation and irresponsible lending by the banks.  One gets an idea of this in respect of the property base of the economy.  In 1981 it was €39 billion, by 2006 it was approximately €553 billion.  Without creating any real wealth in the social sense, the property base of the economy had been revalued, driven on a speculative engine.  This has created an entire distortion of the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I quibble with some of the figures in this morning's report and observations by international bodies such as the IMF but they speak of an extraordinary proportion of Irish GDP being allocated to stabilising the banking system.  They suggest that before we are out of the wars in respect of banking stability it will have cost us €24 billion, some 13.9% of €171 billion of GDP.  That is important as background context.  If we were not facing this appalling failure in the public finances at so many levels we would not be turning to those dependent on transfers such as social welfare for reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The term transfer is incredibly important.  I have been in the Dáil for over 20 years and usually when people speak about transfer payments, they concentrate on social welfare recipients.  They are far more reluctant to examine the transfers that take place every year in the Finance Bill to those taking advantage of tax breaks.  They are of a particular kind.  I refer to tax breaks associated with car parks and spas.  In that category, 86% of them apply to people earning more than €200,000 a year.  The figure for the subsidy of interest relief to landlords is some €400 million in a half year.  There is a long list of these transfers, which were driven on by the Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, who liked introducing them and followed the poisonous policy, that infected the Government from the Progressive Democrats, that there was something backward about paying tax.  Therefore, we had to be a low tax economy and one was encouraged to say the money was one's own and one should be entitled to decide how to spend it.  The grandmother of all that, Mrs. Thatcher, said there is no such thing as society.  Transfers went on all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Those on the left made mistakes and assumed the right was anti-State.  It was not that, it was that they were in favour of the State regularly transferring benefit after benefit as they went on, so that one gets to a point where one could socialise all the costs of existence and privatise all of the income.  That model has wreaked havoc in terms of poverty across the world.  Ideology flows from this.  It would like to prop up a low wage economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">With respect, there are assumptions in the Minister's speech.  I want to be polite about this but I was a sociologist for 20 years and challenge her to produce the evidence behind some of the statements in her speech.  An example is the assumption made about young jobseekers.  Where is the published research or evidence to suggest that young jobseekers are deliberately choosing social welfare payments over work?  I assert that the research is not there at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">There is a cock and bull story about a pilot scheme in Letterkenny, the reports back from which the Minister refers to in her speech.  She says that some "candidates did not wish to participate" and became unmanageable.  Another phrase used is "difficult to manage".  Some years ago we would be regaled by Fianna Fáil speakers and Ministers or former Ministers would speak about what they called "our beautiful youth".  Suddenly, these young people are very problematic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Earlier, the Minister outlined her reasons for reducing benefit for people under 20.  She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1141">The rate of jobseeker's allowance that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 is being reduced from €204.30 per week to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009.  When a person on the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance reaches the age of 20, if he or she still qualifies for the allowance, he or she will be entitled to the full adult rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">She went on to detail the full adult rate of the relevant schemes in certain categories.  The assumptions in all of this in many cases is the following rationale.  The Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1143">The rationale for this change is straightforward.  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at 18 years of age without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency from an early age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">I challenge that assumption and I challenge the Minister to produce a jot of published refereed evidence for it.  The Minister continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1145">While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the next few years.  If they do not improve their skills, they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">I agree with that but where in this Bill is the facility for a speedy return to education?  Why should such people have to be unemployed for two years?  If the Minister and Government are so concerned about young people, why are they requiring them to be unemployed for two years?</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Minister continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1148">They are considered to be at greater risk of having difficulty securing a job than older jobseekers who might have low skills but who at least have some work experience.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide 18 and 19 year old jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment that pays more than €100 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">This is the evidence of a low-wage economy.  I could go on quoting the Minister's speech but she would have had support from the Labour Party if there had been specific measures for changing the administration of all of these young people who are really casualties of the economy rather than people who are choosing to be idle.  What runs through the speech is the old deadly ideology that unless we make young people do something, they would prefer to be idle.  I challenge the Minister to again provide evidence on this point.  The Combat Poverty Agency used to be separate and independent in doing studies but it has been absorbed lest it give any jot of independent criticism.  I presume there is a research facility that would be able to address this issue and I would be delighted to be proven wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">The Bill also makes proposals relating to lower income families.  I have a fairly conservative view of family life.  My own wife as an actress chose to spend her time at home helping me in my career and in the education of our children.  It is an important choice to have for a male or female parent.  The former Deputy and Minister, Mr. McCreevy, set his face totally against that and thus such choice was made impossible even for different kinds of couples and so forth.  The idea was that there would be a form of equalisation that would make such a choice difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">Equally, there are other anomalies which I do not have time to go into.  For example, from the Revenue Commissioners' perspective two people in a household are regarded as not being able to share their tax credits, although they can share the capacity for disqualification with regard to benefits.  None of that need bother Commissioner McCreevy, who gave us the advice as we entered this crisis that we should keep on partying.  That was the inspired advice of the Progressive Democrat convert, who should be ashamed to show his face in this country again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">Considering the families that will pay it, the increase in the health levy in section 12 combined with the abolition of the early child care supplement in section 8 will mean a single income family with two children under five years of age with a salary of €40,000 — which is normal enough — will lose €230 per month from net income.  The income levy can be added to this, together with the abolition of mortgage interest relief if the people are in a home and more than seven years into its mortgage.  Perhaps these people did not choose to live in one of those counties outside Dublin beyond Kildare.  If they choose to travel to work, there are additional costs.  What is proposed in this legislation will involve a cost of over €3,000 a year to the family household.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">There is no attempt in the long, ideological harangue that is in the Minister's speech to assess net household impact with regard to budgeted income on the basics.  These could relate to groceries, travel, electricity, gas and so forth used by model families.  We used to get that from "Priscilla" and other models in the back of Finance Bill speeches relating to the budget.  There is nothing in this budget which takes any cognisance of the difficulties being created for family budgets of the lower paid.  Neither is there any sensitive treatment on the question of how jobs are threatened and how, in a way, this complicated and heavy administrative structure of taking from the poorest could have been avoided by looking at other more direct forms of revenue raising.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The Minister has given a very large proportion of her speech to what she calls the imaginative introduction of the pre-school year, with so many hours per week being provided.  One must judge the pre-school year in terms of what people are losing in child benefit.  One must also consider the people who will contract for the pre-school year in terms of their costs for insurance, lighting, heating and other things.  In addition, there is the ability to control costs for the families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">Occasionally, I meet families who make representations whose child care costs exceed mortgage payments.  Once again we come back to the impact on net budgets of low income families.  The cost of child care has been increasing all the time, an area I could deal with at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">There is a statistical generalisation in the Minister's speech that suggests rents have been so generally reduced that one can speak about significant reductions in rent supplement.  I have seen no evidence that rents have reduced in the low end of the market.  It is true that some of the sources given in the Minister's speech for the reduction in rents come from the middle to high end of the Dublin market.  There is no evidence that the low end of the market in provincial cities has come down by anything, yet the reduction in the rent supplement and the increasing proportion which the person must pay has been imposed generally on the basis of an unquantified and unsupported generalisation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1161">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  We are of the view that there is a need for the Minister to review the circumstances surrounding the granting of an international haulage licence to a convicted drug dealer and also that this licence should be revoked with immediate effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">This extraordinary case has been bubbling up for a number of years but it has recently begun to come to the boil.  Many aspects of the case relate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, there are some which relate to the Department of Transport.  The latter took the major decision to grant Kieran Boylan, a notorious drug dealer with convictions in Britain and Ireland, a licence to conduct his business as a haulage contractor.  This matter was brought to the attention of the Department of Transport in 2003 and 2008 — on both occasions a licence was granted — by which time the gentleman in question had been convicted in respect of attempting to supply €750,000 worth of heroine and cocaine that was seized in the docklands area of my constituency.  On 31 July 2008 a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered by the Attorney General in very strange circumstances.  Having been granted a licence in September 2008, the same gentleman applied to have the name which appears on it changed into the Irish form.  This all took place despite the fact that there were clear breaches of the rules and guidelines surrounding the granting of international haulage licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">As everyone is aware, Mr. Boylan's convictions are of the most serious kind.  Cocaine and heroine have caused a great deal of destruction among the communities of my constituency and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  To grant an international haulage licence to someone convicted of the crime of supplying drugs could only compound the problem.  It is extraordinary that such a licence was granted without the most stringent examination being carried out in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">The Minister appeared to indicate that accurate information was not provided.  He must provide the House with a full explanation with regard to what exactly transpired in this case.  What were the circumstances in which the licence was initially granted and then renewed and transferred into the Irish version of the gentleman's name?  What information did the Garda provide in respect of this matter?  Was the Department misled?  If so, why was that the case and who was responsible?  The Minister must get to the bottom of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">Pending the outcome of the full inquiry, the Minister has at his disposal sufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence — in the form of his admission to the Department in respect of his convictions — that the man in question is not a suitable person to hold an international haulage licence.  As a result, that licence should be revoked forthwith.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_701">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1166">This is an important, serious and disturbing case, at the heart of which lies the failure of the Government and the Departments of Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do their job.  The Government, through those Departments, has failed to protect the public.  As Deputy Costello stated, drugs destroy families and communities.  It is unforgivable that Ministers failed to ensure adequate protocols were in place to check the records of those applying for international haulage licences for evidence of criminal convictions.  The Government failed utterly to carry out such checks and also to protect the public.  As a consequence, the drugs that were imported to this country via our ports — on lorries and by other means — will destroy many lives in the communities in which we live.  The Government has utterly failed with regard to its duty of care in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">The litany of circumstances and situations relating to this case is unbelievable.  For example, how can an applicant for an international haulage licence conceal the fact that he served a nine-month sentence in England in 2001 or that he had a conviction for dangerous driving in respect of which he had been disqualified from driving for two years?  How could this individual be granted an international haulage licence before the end of his two-year driving ban?  This man did not disclose that he had an existing conviction for dangerous driving.  However, the authorities failed to uncover the relevant information in that regard.  How in the name of God did he obtain the licence?</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">Why are applications for haulage licences not automatically referred to the Garda for its approval?  Why was this man's licence not withdrawn by the Department of Transport in 2004 when, following a complaint, his previous convictions — including that relating to dangerous driving — came to light?  The regulations are clear in this regard and state that such an offence will result in an automatic disqualification.  The Department knew the position but did not disqualify this man and he continued to drive and carry out his business.  Who is protecting this individual?</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">Good repute checks were carried out in respect of this man in 2006 and 2007.  We have not been informed with regard to why these checks were carried out.  The report we received does not comment on this aspect of the matter.  Why did the Garda not respond to the Department in respect of the check carried out in 2006?  How can such a failure to respond be acceptable?  This gentleman is a convicted drug dealer who was sentenced in the Central Criminal Court in 2006 to five years in prison, with two years suspended.  In such circumstances, how was it possible for him to renew his international road haulage licence in 2008?</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">The regulations to which I referred earlier clearly indicate that any person who has been charged with an indictable offence is not fit to hold an international haulage licence.  However, such a licence was issued.  This man had a conviction for dangerous driving but was still granted a licence.  He had been convicted of an indictable offence but the Department gave him a licence and then did not revoke it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_1171">I agree with the points raised by Deputies Costello and O'Dowd.  It appears the documentation released by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, leaves no doubt that members of the Garda Síochána misled officials of his Department regarding the granting of a licence to the individual in question.  Equally disturbing is the ease with which the officials of the Department of Transport accepted the unsatisfactory answers provided by the Garda and granted the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">There is a cover-up in respect of this matter.  Information had to be dragged out of the Garda at every turn regarding the man in question.  There are inexplicable time lapses on the file relating to this matter and these must be addressed.  In addition, a number of issues were not dealt with in the course of the application.  Certain aspects of the case stink.  We are seeking that answers be provided.  We do not want inquiries or the issue to be fudged.  The Minister for Transport was asked about this matter on Friday last and has still not made a decision in respect of it.  Having regard to the facts already on file, I am of the view there is sufficient evidence to warrant the revocation of this man's licence with immediate effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">What telephone conversations or meetings took place between members of the Garda Síochána and officials of the Department of Transport?  Why was reference not made on the man's file to the serious charges relating to events at Dublin Port?  The man in question served a total of seven and a half years in prison in Britain but this did not appear to be relevant.  In addition, he passed a good repute test administered by the Department of Transport.  The Minister for Transport stated that at no stage in the past had any prosecutions been taken against him in respect of his livelihood as a professional road transport operator.  Would Deputy O'Dowd's point regarding the conviction for dangerous driving not be fundamental in that regard?  At no stage in the past did the gardaí raise or link in any correspondence issues relating to his good repute as a professional road transport operator.  A drug dealer passes a test of good repute?  Then the fudge comes, that the constitutional right to earn a livelihood could not be taken away lightly.  It has not been taken away at all, the opposite has happened, this man has been facilitated in what he has been proven to do in the international road haulage business having regard to his convictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">Aspects of this are incredible and explanations must be provided by the Government.  Ministerial responsibility must be seen to take effect and the licence must be revoked immediately.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1175">A road haulage operator's licence is granted under section 2 of the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006 and entitles the holder to carry on a road haulage business for hire or reward.  Further statutory regulations govern various details regarding the application process.  An international licence enables the holder to carry goods for hire and reward throughout Ireland and the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">The core criteria for the grant of a road haulage operator's licence are contained in the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations 1991.  These state that the applicant must satisfy the criteria of sound financial standing, good repute, and professional competence.  Regulation 7 of these regulations sets down the considerations to be taken into account when determining whether an applicant for a road haulage licence is of "good repute".  These regulations also have a list of "relevant offences" outlined in the first schedule that are to be taken into account when deciding whether an applicant satisfies the requirements on good repute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">An application was received from the individual in question for an international road haulage operator's licence on 12 May 2008.  The applicant indicated that he had one conviction on 15 February 2006 under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act for an offence committed on 2 December 2003, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment with the last two years suspended.  Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 relates to the possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply.  On inspection of all the accompanying documentation, all other aspects of the application, including accounts relating to financial standing, tax clearance certificate and accompanying documents and affidavits, were found to be in order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">When determining an application for a road haulage operator licence, regard shall be taken as to whether the applicant has relevant convictions in the immediate five year period preceding the application.  On foot of the applicant's self declaration of his conviction in his application form, the Garda was requested to undertake a good repute check on 12 May 2008 on this individual.  In addition, further clarification was sought from the Garda in June and again in July and August 2008 on foot of the responses received from it.  On 30 July 2008, the Garda advised that no evidence was given at his trial that the applicant's haulage company was involved in the commission of the offences for which he was convicted, and that he had not come under notice for breaches of road transport legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">Arising from some press reports in August about the applicant, it was unclear to the Department whether there were other charges pending or if some charges previously mentioned had been struck out.  Accordingly, the officials wrote again to the Garda Síochána in August asking it to indicate the Garda's view about the applicant's good repute and his suitability to be granted a licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">In the response received at the end of August, the Garda indicated that the applicant had been charged with breaches of sections 3, 15, 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in the Circuit Criminal Court 29 on 15 February 2006.  The judge sentenced him to five years' imprisonment on each charge backdated to 20 September 2005, with sentences to run concurrently. The response also said that the judge suspended the final two years of the sentence on condition that the individual in question entered a bond to keep the peace for a period of two years from the date of his release.  The Garda made no comment on whether it regarded the applicant to be a person of good repute or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Following consideration of all the issues involved, a decision was then made by officials in the Department to grant the licence on the basis that there were insufficient grounds to refuse it and the Garda had not made any comment on the question of good repute.  The decision took into account the criteria outlined in the regulations and the Garda responses to requests in that regard, as well as the wider issues surrounding the applicant's constitutional right to earn a livelihood, a right that could not be taken away lightly.  The fact that the applicant had already served his sentence for the conviction on record, and that he had no further convictions since then, was also taken into account.  In addition, the Garda had confirmed on 30 July 2008 that it had not taken prosecutions against the applicant related to his livelihood as a professional road transport operator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">Accordingly, the applicant was granted his international road haulage operator's licence on 4 September 2008.  The licence is valid for five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The House will be aware that there has been some other media publicity in recent days concerning the individual in question.  Those matters are the subject of separate reviews by the appropriate authorities, including the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  I should, however, add that the Minister for Transport is reviewing the legislation and criteria in this area, because the legal and constitutional issues in this area have proven to be difficult and complex and also arise in other licensing areas, such as taxi driver licensing.  Also, in some cases the deciding authority is the relevant Department, Minister or other licensing authority while in other cases it is the Garda, for example in the case of taxi driving licences or intoxicating liquor licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Issues around the criteria for establishing good repute here have also arisen in other member states.  The European Union is in the process of updating and consolidating the existing European legislation governing this area and this is nearing completion.  This includes provisions regarding the establishment of an EU wide network of electronic databases which will include conviction information on every licensed operator.  Member states will have clear rules allowing them to take convictions in other EU member states into account.  The European Commission will be tasked with an examination of what constitutes relevant convictions and what weight will be apportioned to different types of convictions when deciding to award or revoke licences.  When these new EU regulations are finalised, the appropriate legislation to implement them will be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The Minister for Transport is currently in the process of reviewing all aspects of the decision to award this licence to the individual in question.  He has already received a preliminary report on this matter and a full report is being prepared for him.  The Minister has referred this matter to the Attorney General for advice regarding the legal issues involved. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment on this matter at this moment in time.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_704">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1186">I represent a rural constituency where many people live in isolated areas and this scheme allowed them to have the peace of mind and feeling of security brought about by having a monitored alarm system.  Their relatives were also reassured by the scheme.  I do not understand, therefore, why the scheme is being suspended.  I hope the Minister will be true to his word when he says it will be reinstated in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">This signifies a further erosion of services, particularly for older people.  Tonight we debated the loss of the Christmas bonus for pensioners and we all remember the fiasco of the medical cards for the over 70s.  Now many older people who live independently in isolated areas no longer feel safe as a result of the loss of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">It also gives a certain degree of comfort to people who might embark on robberies in rural areas.  People are now storing money at home and older people have always had a tendency to do so.  The reduction in home help hours means there are fewer callers to people in rural areas, so the lack of monitored alarms will have an effect.  In the Fermoy area of my constituency of Cork East, 51 monitored alarms were distributed since January.  A further 28 older people were on the waiting list.  They will now have to pay approximately €300 from their pension to get an alarm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">According to Irish Rural Link, Muintir na Tire and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the scheme costs approximately €3 million but €2.4 million of that is recouped through VAT paid to the Exchequer.  It is a worthwhile scheme and I ask the Minister to reinstate it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_705">
            <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
            <p eId="para_1190">I am pleased I submitted my Adjournment matter to the Ceann Comhairle in sufficient time and I thank him for accepting it tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">I have an idea of what is happening on this matter, not from the Minister but I added two and two — it made 22, not four — when I became aware of various things that were taking place.  I hope the Minister will review this issue and that when he decides to reinstate the scheme, which I hope he will, he will have taken account of the great deal of information which will have been given to him to demonstrate that there are many better ways of implementing the scheme.  In my opinion, the scheme should always be in the hands of voluntary groups such as Muintir na Tire or Irish Rural Link, which is based in Moate, or Helplink South, a wonderful voluntary organisation supplying huge numbers of people with monitors through its very dedicated staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">I am aware that details have emerged which are not helpful for the people who most need these aids.  As Deputy Sherlock said, it is a wonderful scheme.  While I live in the town of Athlone much of my constituency is rural.  When I visit the house of a person who lives alone I always notice when they are wearing the chain and disc around their neck.  Thankfully, the person will be able to ring somebody if they require help.  The professional way in which the alarms are monitored and responded to is amazing.  It gives great ease and comfort to older people.  Undoubtedly, it is a very good scheme.  I am sure the Minister, in his thorough and calm way, has decided in the review to put a stop to what is not right in the scheme and to encourage the correct way of doing things.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">All schemes when they are started have a good basis for getting off the ground.  Everybody is delighted and encouraging but as time passes various matters impinge upon the scheme, which is not good for the scheme's recipients.  I wish the Minister good luck in the review, but I hope he will tell us that the scheme will be restarted in a proper, monitored and structured way.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_706">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1194">There is widespread anger at the decision to suspend funding for the scheme of community support for older people.  This scheme has been used successfully to provide enhanced security and peace of mind for older people in their homes.  It is especially important for older people living alone in rural Ireland but it is by no means confined to rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">Like many Deputies I have received representations from within my constituency and outside it.  As one correspondent states, the decision will "impact greatly on the lives of older and vulnerable people".  Attacks on older people in their homes, ranging from intrusion to assault, not only cause terror to the victims but spread fear across the older population throughout the country.  Even a break-in where nothing is taken and where the older person does not encounter the intruder, is extremely traumatic.  The older person's feeling of security in his or her own home has been shattered, in many cases never to be restored again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">This scheme provided practical support with the installation of security alarms, door and window locks, security lighting and smoke alarms.  Community alert groups carried out much of this work, with a network that reached across the State.  Of course, no devices fitted in a home can substitute for neighbours, friends and care workers regularly calling and ensuring that the older person has the social support he or she needs.  However, with this cut the Government appears to be saying that the security of older people is not a priority given that the cut will produce very paltry so-called savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">This cut cannot be seen in isolation.  It comes on top of the cut in home help hours and the totally inadequate provision of health and personal social services to older people in the community.  The Government claims to be encouraging older people to remain in their homes, as most of them earnestly wish to do, but it is cutting the essential supports to enable them to do so.  Sadly, many more will be driven into institutional care at far greater cost to the State.  I join my colleagues in making a cross-party appeal to the Minister to restore this scheme at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1198">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I am particularly pleased, personally, to have the opportunity to address this debate this evening.  I had responsibility for this matter before today and I am pleased to have responsibility for it again.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1200">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to be back in this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">My Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people since mid-2002, when the Department was first established.  The scheme, as originally devised in 1996, was based on the simple concept of helping people active in their communities to maintain contact with older people in their neighbourhood.  Grants are not paid to individuals but to community organisations working with the older person.  This approach has helped over the years to ensure that broader community support for older people was stimulated and allowed volunteers and staff of community organisations to maintain contacts with the older person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Since my Department took over the scheme, in excess of €22 million has been awarded to community and voluntary organisations.  Our estimates suggest that some 60,000 older people have been direct beneficiaries, either by being supplied with a monitored alarm, sometimes referred to as the "pendant alarm" or "panic button", or one of the other security items for their homes.  The Department reviewed the scheme in 2004 and made a number of innovations in response to the concerns raised at that time.  The scheme was developed to allow for window locks, the installation of door locks and chains and the cost of providing for sensor exterior lighting to be covered by it.  Further innovations have been introduced since then, including a grant in respect of smoke alarms.  Funding is now provided for carbon monoxide detectors, where they are supplied as part of other smoke detection devices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">One of the key recommendations of the 2004 review was that a standard individual grant be paid.  This grant is now fixed at €300 per installation for the monitored alarm and lower amounts for the other equipment available.  This approach has helped to ensure that community groups get good value for money and that commercial suppliers are obliged to provide quality equipment at a reasonable price, given that these products vary little in their design or service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">I am happy that the current level of grant ensures that recipients of the alarm are not required to make any contribution to the cost of the supply or installation of the equipment.  The only costs falling to the older person or their family members are the annual monitoring costs.  I have been told that the costs of the annual monitoring charge can vary from as low as €50 per annum to a high of over €100.  This is an area in which I would support greater competition.  People need to shop around for the best value available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">The changes introduced in 2004 have meant that the demand for grants has grown to unsustainable levels.  From 2002 to 2006, the average annual expenditure on the scheme was approximately €2.4 million.  The average expenditure for 2007 and 2008 reached over €4 million, an increase of two thirds.  This, Deputies will agree, is clearly a position that could not be sustained, even in better times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">I am also concerned that the changes introduced to the scheme in recent years have meant it is no longer targeting real and genuine need among older people.  As a result, the scheme was suspended in early April.  This was done with a view to affording my Department the opportunity to review its operation over the next few months and re-launching it later in the year with tighter terms and conditions.  This was done specifically in the context of meeting the real need among older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">Yesterday, I met with representatives of Age Action Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Muintir na Tire, Irish Rural Link and the Senior Citizen Parliament to discuss the suspension of the scheme and some concerns about how it currently operates.  Arising from those discussions, I have agreed with them a process that will set the broad parameters for a review of the scheme and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of it.  I am hopeful that the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid-September.  The bodies have agreed to participate in the review process and to work with my officials regarding concerns they have with the operation of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">I assure the Deputies that all applications received up to the suspension of the scheme will be processed and approved, as appropriate, in line with the current eligibility criteria.  Funding will be made available to eligible groups in the coming weeks.  Deputy Sherlock said there were delays and spoke about the concerns that would cause for older people.  Traditionally, this scheme was advertised once each year and if one missed the cut-off date, one had to wait another 12 months.  We changed that recently and there is now a continuous application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">We cleared all applications on hand up to the end of December last.  The allocation last year was approximately €4.3 million, so there is no big or substantial overhang.  More than €1 million worth of applications have come in this year.  Some have been paid and some are still pending.  All of the applications that were received early this year will be dealt with.  I wish to make it clear that even with the review period, we are still dealing with the issue in a much more timely and efficient manner than under the procedure that existed previously, whereby one could apply only once a year.  We do not have a six or 12 months overhang as we cleared everything up to the end of December.  The applications that arrived in the earlier part of this year, prior to the suspension of the scheme, will be dealt with in the normal way.  We are not accepting new applications during the review period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">In addition, it is important to note that the suspension of the scheme in no way affects those who already have received a monitored alarm device.  Finally, I reiterate my commitment to this scheme and the security it has offered to the many older people using the alarms.  I hope to re-launch it later in the year, in September, once the review is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">At 31 March 2009, there were 322 attested Reserve Gardaí and 152 Reserve trainees.  Details of the stations to which Reserve members are currently assigned are set out in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force. As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputies that the Garda Commissioner is continuing to make every effort to reach the recruitment target.  In that context I would point out that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">Recruitment is ongoing and the Public Appointments Service has received over 1,100 expressions of interest to join the Reserve in 2009.  The PAS hold interviews on a rolling basis at a range of locations around the country.  The ongoing public information campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve includes indoor and outdoor awareness raising campaigns and radio and TV promotional interviews nationally and locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.  I am fully satisfied that the Reserve provides a valuable contribution to the Garda Síochána and to the many communities where it is operating.  In particular, I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the Reserve who serve on a voluntary basis and give of their time very generously.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1397">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 56 and 110 of 25 February, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">Since then and in advance of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume, my Department has introduced a number of measures to achieve the general administrative cost reductions which are required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">All expenditure in my Department's Vote Group is reviewed every month by the Department's Financial Management Committee.  Expenditure trends are identified and where necessary, corrective measures are put in place. In addition to this high level expenditure control function, each Departmental agency, division and associated body has its own financial management processes which, in some instances, monitor trends on a weekly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">Prudent financial management requires that contingency arrangements be put in place, where possible, to cover unanticipated events. In this respect my Department's contingency arrangements include the postponement of spending decisions on "discretionary" items until such time as the likely overall expenditure patterns on the Vote Group have become clearer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">Clearly, the Government sector, as a major procurer of goods and services, is in a unique position to maximise its purchasing power.  Consequently, my Department has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of existing supplier arrangements, costs and rates in order to identify potential savings.  This is in addition to the savings already being achieved by the implementation of the 8% reduction in professional fees.  In advance of the establishment of the National Procurement Operations Unit, my Department has also strengthened its sectoral procurement network in order to achieve the best prices from the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">The Deputy will be aware that a key area where savings can be realised is in the shared services approach, where back office functions, such as Finance, ICT and HR, can be shared by a number of different units to produce cost savings. My Department fully supports the concept of shared services and currently operates a major public sector financial shared services centre in Killarney, as well as an IT shared services facility which encompasses the core Department, twenty sectoral agencies and over 1,500 users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that my Department is also participating in the Office of Public Works (OPW) Energy Awareness Campaign.  This project aims to conserve energy in State Buildings and has as its objective a 15% reduction of CO2 emissions per annum in all of the nominated State Buildings.  A number of my Department's main buildings are included in this project and, with the assistance of the OPW and external advisors, we are already well on the way to achieving our targets and real cost reductions in energy supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">I expect that, in accordance with the Government's decisions on these matters, the required budgetary savings will be achieved by my Department in 2009.  The precise details of these reductions are still being finalised and will be published in the normal way in the Revised Estimates Volume on Thursday.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot pre-empt their formal publication but I anticipate that the amount to be saved in respect of these administrative reductions will be in the order of €10m.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1406">I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that there have been six deaths in custody in 2007, eleven deaths in 2008 and three deaths to date in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">All deaths in custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a Coroner's Court.  The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Court.  Of the twenty deaths in custody since 2007, the cause of death has been determined formally in five cases.  Two deaths were attributed to natural causes, two were classified as deaths by misadventure and an open verdict was recorded in one case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by a multi-disciplinary group in each institution.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service Steering Group for the Prevention of Self-Harm and Death in the Prison Population provides a forum for collating the reports of the local groups and disseminating significant findings throughout the prison system.  There are strategies and plans in place in all institutions for the prevention of suicides.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">As regards deaths in Garda custody, I am informed that 6 people have died in custody since 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">Section 102 of the Garda Siochana Act 2005 requires the Garda Commissioner to refer to the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) any matter that appears to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda Siochana may have resulted in the death or serious harm to a person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Since GSOC has become operational in May 2007 there have been three deaths in custody.  A file was sent to the DPP in one case — returned with no direction for prosecution — and two other cases are still under investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">The Treatment of Offenders in Custody Regulations (1987 and 2006) prescribe the actions of the Garda Siochana when dealing with persons in their custody.  Members are fully aware of their responsibilities to those in their custody and of the need for strict compliance with the regulations.  In this regard there have been a number of developments in recent times:</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">guidance notes on the Regulations for members of An Garda Síochána had been extensively updated to incorporate legislative changes and other legal developments and to reflect best practice.  These notes have been circulated to all members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">In his foreword to the new guidance notes, the Garda Commissioner has stressed that it is imperative that members of An Garda Síochána in complying with legal requirements promote respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">A revised Garda Síochána Custody Record had been introduced incorporating a new section on children and capturing more comprehensive details on the condition of the detained person on arrival.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">The operation of all these measures is subject to ongoing monitoring and review as appropriate and is part of An Garda Síochána's overall commitment to upholding and protecting the rights of all detained persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Finally, on a related point, arising from the Dean Lyons case an Expert Group to examine the adequacy of Garda protocols and procedures relating to the interviewing of vulnerable persons was established.  This group is expected to report in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">Existing legislation makes extensive provision for unmarried fathers with respect to their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Under the law as it stands — section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987 — an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">These legislative provisions are comprehensive.  They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.  The vast majority of applications by unmarried fathers for guardianship are granted by the court.</p>

            <p eId="para_1424">The 2009 prisons capital programme includes a number of important projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Thornton Hall</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">A preferred bidder for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of the new prison development at Thornton Hall, County Dublin has been selected.  While negotiations on the contract are at an advanced stage they have not yet been completed to the point that the Project Agreement can be signed.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that negotiations with the preferred bidder are currently at an advanced stage.  These negotiations are focussed on progressing financial, technical and legal aspects of the project.  Construction of the new prison will commence immediately after contract award and should take no more than 3 years to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">New Blocks at Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Other major projects in hand at present include the commissioning and opening of new cell blocks at Portlaoise and at Wheatfield and a new remand wing at Castlerea Prison.  These projects will provide over 400 additional spaces.  The developments at Portlaoise and Castlerea are on schedule and it is expected that both blocks will be ready for occupation shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">The new cell block at Wheatfield, also on schedule, will be ready later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">In addition to these projects, a new Recreation Building is due for completion shortly at Castlerea along with revisions to the Exercise Yards and some other facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">Mobile Phone Inhibition</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">Phases 1 and 2 of this project have been successfully completed and evaluated in the Midlands Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">The results of the project so far have convinced the Irish Prison Service of the merit of extending the inhibition system to the new "C" Block in Portlaoise Prison and the nearby Segregation Unit, and installation work is currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Three other companies, each relying on technology designed by themselves (and different in its modus operandum from each others), are also being given an opportunity to install trial systems of mobile phone inhibition in some of our prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">When evaluation of the trial systems is complete, it is intended to seek competitive tenders on a prison by prison basis from all companies whose product meets our requirements for installation of inhibitors.  The roll-out of this project will continue throughout 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Other Projects</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">A number of smaller but nevertheless significant projects in the areas of ICT, Fire Safety, CCTV, Exercise Yard netting and other Security Initiatives are planned for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">A 2009-2012 rolling Capital Programme for the Prison Estate is currently being finalised.  This programme will outline the key areas of capital expenditure over the next four years including the provision of additional prison spaces, enhanced security, elimination of obsolete and unsuitable accommodation and continued improvements to the fabric of the Prisons Estate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1444">Though legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is already very strong and heavy penalties are already in place, I am moving to strengthen the law in this area.  In that context, I sought and received proposals from the Garda Commissioner on strengthening the law on knife crime.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">increasing the maximum prison sentence for possessing a knife in a public place from one year to five years; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">creating an extended power of search without warrant in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">I have accepted these proposals and the relevant changes to the Law in this area will be made in the context of the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was considered by Government at its meeting today.  The Bill deals with a range of amendments to current statutes including very significant changes to the Firearms Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">Following the consideration of the matter by Government today, I expect to publish the Bill shortly and it is my intention to have the issues to which the Deputy refers along with the other important issues relating to the control of firearms and offensive weapons being dealt with in this legislation, brought before the House at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">In addition, I have directed the drafting of a new Firearms and Offensive Weapons Order which will deal with the issue of swords.  In particular, I will be banning the sale of samurai swords.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1452">The statement referred to by the Deputy has recently been made available by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Amongst various matters raised in the statement there is comment expressing reservation that needle and syringe exchange programmes are available to prisoners in only eight countries throughout the world and opiate substitution therapy in only thirty three States, often restricted to those who already have begun to receive treatment prior to incarceration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">There is concern expressed by the Special Rapporteur that, notwithstanding recommendations and decisions of various international Human Rights bodies, failure to provide adequate health services to detainees may contribute to conditions amounting to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.  He goes on to raise concern that failure to ensure access to harm reduction measures — both inside and outside prisons — puts injecting drug users at unnecessary and avoidable risk of blood borne infection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">In the Irish context, I would remind the Deputy that all prisoners have access to health services on an equivalent basis to citizens in the general community covered by the General Medical Services scheme.  The Irish Prison Service has, in the context of drug treatment services, been engaged in collaborative efforts involving community health and drug treatment resources aimed at ensuring that the range of services available to prisoners is consistent with good practice in the general community.  Notwithstanding present resource difficulties, it remains a priority of my Department and the Irish Prison Service that such services will continue to be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Turning to the question of needle exchange in prisons.  My position on this matter is clear — I do not support such a move.  Any person seeking syringes, needles and fluids under such a scheme would essentially be indicating to the prison authorities that he or she is in possession of, or shortly will be in illegal possession of, controlled drugs and proposes consuming them.  To supply a prisoner with the requested items in these circumstances would, in effect, be to tell him or her that prison management will facilitate the commission of serious criminal offences in the prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Needle Exchange Schemes would subvert, and run contrary to increasing staff vigilance in searching for drugs and preventing them being smuggled into prisons.  As far as my Department is concerned, drug control in prisons would be reduced to a game in which a blind eye approach to successful breaches of the controls would, in time, become the order of the day.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to the twin strategies of Supply and Demand Reduction to deal with the issues of drugs in prison — closing off routes of supply and providing appropriate support to prisoners to tackle their addictions.  The introduction of needle exchange would run contrary to these approaches.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">As previously stated, my priority and that of the Irish Prison Service is to ensure that an appropriate range of treatment services is available to all prisoners requiring these.</p>

            <p eId="para_1466">Generally speaking when a prisoner has fully completed his or her sentence he/she is no longer subject to any legal obligation to be subject to supervision.  However, some former prisoners will of their own volition participate in courses/programmes arranged through the Probation Service.  Furthermore, in the case of certain offences (e.g. sexual offences) the Judge at the time of sentencing may include a post release supervision order which applies after the custodial part of the sentence has been served.  Some form of supervision may also be imposed by the Courts in the context of a part or full suspended sentence.  Of course, prisoners, including life sentenced prisoners, given temporary release are still subject to their sentence and temporary release is given subject to various conditions which the prisoner must comply with or else they risk return to prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">Persons come under the supervision of the Probation Service on release from prison under certain specific legislation, namely:</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">The Criminal Justice Act 1960 (temporary release) as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003;</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">The Sex Offender Act 2001; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The Criminal Justice Act 2006</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">In respect of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 (temporary release) as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 there are currently 82 offenders under the supervision of Probation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">In respect of the Sex Offender Act, 2001 there were 106 sex offenders under the supervision of the Probation Service on the 20th April of which 80 have served a custodial sentence prior to commencing supervision.  On the same date there were 139 offenders in custody who will be subject to supervision following release.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">In respect of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 I am advised that the Probation Service is updating its record on the number of offenders in the community who are subject to Probation supervision in the community under this Act.  When this work is completed I will provide the Deputy with the up-to-date information.  I can tell the Deputy that there are currently 477 prisoners in custody serving part suspended sentences under the 2006 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">The Probation Service carries out formal risk assessments on offenders using validated risk assessment instruments.  This informs both the level of supervision and the targets for intervention during supervision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Evidence from research indicates that the higher the level of risk, the greater the level of intervention required.  Supervision levels therefore vary depending on the level of assessed risk.  Supervision incorporates a multi agency and cross sectoral approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">Additionally my Department through the Probation Service financially supports a broad range of community programmes to support the supervision process.  For example, in partnership with the Granada Institute, the Probation Service runs the Lighthouse Sex Offender Treatment Programme.  This is a therapeutic group work programme which aims to reduce the risk of re-offending.  There are two group work programmes running currently in Dublin and one in Cork.  The three programmes offer places to a total on 24 sex offenders at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">I should also make the Deputy aware of some more recent developments:</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">Firstly, I published a significant Discussion Document on the management of sex offenders last January which sets out a range of enhanced initiatives that will result in more strategic targeting of higher risk offenders by the Gardaí and the Probation Service with the full support of the Irish Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Secondly, I have asked my Department to review the operation of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Thirdly, I have also asked my Department to examine how we might use Electronic Monitoring technology to monitor sex offenders during the first six months following release from prison as well as the more general application of this technology to the wider prisoner population.  The Project Group set up to look at this matter — which is led by the Probation Service —  is due to report later in the year and my Department is looking at the legislative implications of monitoring the sex offender cohort for a defined period following release.</p>

            <p eId="para_1483">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The Fines Bill 2009 was published last Monday, April the 20th.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">The Bill covers three main areas of policy; the indexation of fines, the capacity of persons to pay fines and alternatives to imprisonment where a fine has not been paid by the due date for payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">In particular, section 14 of the Bill provides that where a fine is imposed on a person, that person may apply to the court to pay the fine by instalments.  If the court is satisfied that to pay in full by the due date would result in undue financial hardship for the person who was fined, or to his or her dependants, the court can direct that the fine be paid by instalments over a period of one year.  An extension of not more than a further year may be given by the court where it is satisfied that the financial circumstances of the person have changed and that the change is not due to the person's culpable neglect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">In addition, I am providing the courts with three new options where a fine has not been paid by the due date.  These are the appointment of a receiver, where the fine was imposed following conviction on indictment, recovery of the fine as if it was a civil debt and the imposition of a community service order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">I believe that this legislation will make a significant contribution towards reducing the numbers imprisoned for the non-payment of fines while at the same time preserving the integrity of the fines system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">There are no plans at present to amend the law in relation to civil debt.  However, operation of the law is being kept under review in my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1520">The Deputy will be aware that prior to 2004 there was a de facto ban on handguns in this jurisdiction.  However, I understand from the Garda Authorities that records indicate approximately 2,000 handguns have been licensed since the beginning of 2004.  The most recent figures on stolen firearms were received on 16 December 2008 and indicate that 31 handguns were recorded as stolen since 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">I am further advised that stolen firearms are used in the course of the commission of other criminal offences but, because not all stolen firearms or firearms used in the commission of offences are recovered, it is not possible to say precisely how many formerly legally held handguns have been used in criminal offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">As I have stated on a number of occasions I am concerned with the situation we now find ourselves in following the growth in the licensing of hand guns over the past few years.  We now have these 2,000 handguns licensed, and not as a result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  As Mr. Justice Charleton said in a recent judgment the public is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.  I am not going to permit the growth of a ‘handgun' culture.  It was against this background that I announced my proposals for reform in this area, which include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns and a strict regime for renewal of existing licenses, with limited exceptions made in relation to Olympic sports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">The House may note the endorsement of these proposals by the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate who draws on her own considerable experience of policing in the United States.  She has recently been quoted as saying that a lot of guns used in the commission of crime in the States are guns that have been stolen from their rightful owners.  We must have controls in place to prevent the same thing happening here.  My proposals will be reflected in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I will be publishing imminently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">It is important to say that my proposals in relation to handguns will not impinge directly on the activities of the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  I recognise that those firearms holders pursue their legitimate interests in a law abiding way and am anxious to have a well regulated sector in which those interests can be successfully pursued, in cooperation with the relevant authorities.  But the reality is specific issues arise from the inherent nature of firearms.</p>

         his views on the Central Statistics Office crime figures for 2008 and on the continued increase in the number of drug offences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1526">The most recent Central Statistics Office figures referred to by the Deputy show an increase of 25.4% in the overall total of drugs offences recorded for 2008 in comparison with 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">It is important to emphasise that, of their nature, drug offences are only recorded as a result of enforcement activity.  For example, obviously possession of drugs for supply is only recorded as an offence where the law enforcement agencies have detected the offence and pursued it.  The statistics in question, therefore, represent increased levels of enforcement and should lead to commendation of the efforts of those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">The House will be aware from media reports and elsewhere of the relentless action being taken particularly by An Garda Síochána in pursuing the activities of drugs gangs and the considerable success they have had through making major seizures and arrests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">Those successes are inevitably reflected in the recording of an increased number of drug offences but it would be a pity if, through some misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statistics, this was to be counted as a failure rather than a success of their enforcement strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">That is not in any way to understate the extent of the problem of drug abuse and the need to devoting considerable resources to tackling it.  That is exactly what is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">Through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, An Garda Síochána continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs and identify those involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">In addition to the officers of the Force specifically assigned to the drugs issue who are attached to the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional Drug Units, officers from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau all assist in our overall law enforcement response to drug trafficking and drug dealing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">In addition, the Gardaí work closely with Customs and the Naval Service under the umbrella of the Joint Task Force on Drugs as well as with their international colleagues in tackling the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">Among recent and ongoing initiatives are the establishment of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent footing, our involvement in the establishment and ongoing operation of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon, strengthened provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 and the ringfencing of €21million this year for Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">Furthermore, I am confident that the legislation which I announced last week dealing with surveillance will be of particular value in tackling drugs gangs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Finally I am sure all members of the House will accept fully that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone.  We need to tackle the demand for drugs and, in this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, are cooperating fully in the development of the new National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009 to 2016 which is being drawn up under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_727">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1541">I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 112, 114 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The following table contains the number of cases of murder recorded in which firearms were used, the number of prosecutions initiated and the number of convictions secured in each year from 1998 to 2008 and in 2009 up to 16 April.  Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, there can be considerable difficulties for them in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  It has to be accepted that the reality is that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who would have information of value to An Garda Síochána often do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the law on evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these changes are targeted at fighting gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle serious crime.  One of the most far reaching has been the introduction of seven day detention for offences connected with organised crime such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of a firearm.  The bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, applicants for bail can be required to provide a statement of their means so that the prosecution can highlight any divergence between their lifestyles and their stated means as evidence of their involvement in gangland activity.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect's silence in response to Garda questioning have also been expanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">We will continue to press forward with this work in strengthening the criminal law.  I published the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 on 17 April.  The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the powers available to An Garda Síochána to prevent and detect serious crime, as well as to safeguard the security of the State against subversion and terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">I have also indicated, particularly in light of the recent killing in Limerick which has very serious implications for the operation of the criminal justice system, that I am working on proposals to strengthen the criminal law in relation to gangland activity particularly through taking an approach similar to that taken against subversive organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">Work is ongoing on legislation to provide for the establishment of a DNA database for criminal investigations purposes.  Such a database will greatly enhance the intelligence available to An Garda Síochána.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill by the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">My proposals for the Criminal Procedure Bill are also well advanced.  While this Bill is primarily aimed at giving effect to the legislative aspects of the Justice for Victims Initiative which I announced last June, some elements of it will be of considerable benefit in our fight against serious crime.  In particular, it is proposed to enable the DPP to seek a re-trial where an acquittal is tainted due, for example, to intimidation of witnesses or jurors.  There will also be a provision on expert evidence, to ensure that the prosecution is given adequate opportunity to examine and challenge evidence being introduced by the defence; in other words, there will be a levelling of the pitch.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for the publication of the Bill shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">Some time ago, I asked my Department and An Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following that review, I have brought forward proposals.  While a de facto ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will also be given legislative form in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">Though legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is already very strong and heavy penalties are already in place, I am moving to strengthen the law in this area.  In that context, I sought and received proposals from the Garda Commissioner on strengthening the law on knife crime.  I have accepted these proposals, and the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will take account of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">The Garda Policing Plan for 2009, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by me as Minister, contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.  An Garda Síochána, in accordance with the priorities I have set, is committed to targeting violent crime and those who engage or facilitate persons involved in such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">One of these operations is Operation Anvil, the primary focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">Under the Operation, up to 22 March, 2009, 2,469 firearms have been recovered throughout the country.  There have also been over 7,500 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary and over 72,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">At a time when the public finances are under pressure, I am determined that top priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil has increased in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million to enable it to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">A significant element of the fight against organised crime by An Garda Síochána is the use of specialist units.  Units with expertise in specific areas operate under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the National Support Services, who has overall responsibility for the coordination of measures designed to address organised crime throughout the State.  Specialist units include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">the Criminal Assets Bureau which identifies and targets funds accumulated by criminals in order to seize such assets and deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity;</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">the Organised Crime Unit which has a specific remit of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of drugs;</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation which is responsible for the investigation of individuals and organisations involved in money laundering;</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which is responsible for investigating the activities of organised criminal networks; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">the National Drugs Unit and dedicated Divisional and District Drugs Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">These units are supported by the Garda Security and Intelligence Section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information.</p>

            <p eId="para_1619">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 125 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering) Bill, which will transpose the requirements of the third EU Money Laundering Directive into Irish Law, along with those of the related implementing Directive is being drafted at present. The highest priority is being given to the drafting and publication of this Bill.  The proposed legislation will also have regard to the relevant recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which published the third mutual evaluation report on Ireland's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in 2006 and made recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">Ireland already has strong anti-money laundering legislation.  The transposition of the 3rd EU Money Laundering  Directive and legislative compliance with the FATF recommendations on anti money laundering and terrorist financing measures, will considerably strengthen and update our existing laws.  I am taking the opportunity through this Bill to repeal and consolidate our existing anti-money laundering provisions in one statute.  This approach will I believe facilitate all the various sectors and groups involved in using and applying the money laundering provisions.  For this reason, when Government approval was given to the drafting of this Bill approval was also given to the publication of the proposals on my Department's website.  Following publication of the Scheme of the Bill my Department, along with the Department of Finance with whom my Department is working closely on the preparation of this legislation, undertook an extensive consultation process involving a wide range of interested parties.  The process included both the provision of written submissions and meetings with many interested groups. The process was an extremely useful and important exercise for all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">The transposition date for the relevant Directives was December 2007.  The European Commission has brought proceedings against Ireland and some other Member States in relation to the transposition of these Directives. As the matter is currently with the European Court of Justice it would be inappropriate to comment any further. It should be noted however that I expect to be in a position to publish the legislation by the first half of this year and it is my intention that it will be considered by both houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible following publication.</p>

It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</p>

Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options which may include stabilization on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.

            <p eId="para_1722">Drug users can present with multiple and complex problems.  For that reason a multidisciplinary approach is needed to effectively care for this group and  best practice would indicate that maintenance of a personalised therapeutic relationship yields the best outcomes.  To assist this process, specialist addiction nursing posts were developed in the Irish Prison Service with a view to streamlining care and throughcare back into the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has 9 spaces specifically allocated for a therapeutic drug free programme.  This intensive programme is 6 weeks in duration and includes involvement from both prison based staff and external community agencies.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving a drug free status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">A further development has been the awarding of a contract for the provision of addiction counselling services to Merchants Quay Ireland.  I am glad to tell the Deputy that this contract has been rolled out, and addiction counselling services are now available in prisons and places of detention where prisoners require such a service.  The addiction counselling service delivers approximately 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">In addition, prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and work and training options which can also assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.  This multifaceted approach  is designed to meet the diverse needs of prisoners.  Whilst it is not possible to give comprehensive detail on the total number of prisoners engaged in the various treatment modalities I can, as an example of one specific intervention, tell the Deputy that  there were 2487 treatment episodes using methadone substitution in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1738">With regard to PULSE, An Garda Síochána have detailed procedures and instructions in place on the operation of the PULSE system. The PULSE system incorporates an accurate audit system which records all record creations and updates made on the system.

Audit-trails also record all inquires made on the core items of interest on the PULSE system including Person and Vehicle.

Under these proposals an ‘Exception activity level report' and related business process has been advanced which will highlight to Garda Management specific PULSE records which are subject to a high level of data access activity occurring within a defined period.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1742">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The Thornton Hall Prison development is not a superprison.  It is a complex Public Private Partnership project which involves the construction of more than 30 buildings, including 8 prison facilities on the site, a major internal road network, extensive perimeter security and a vast array of security systems over a range of security and regime operational models.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that negotiations with the preferred bidder are currently at an advanced stage.  These negotiations are focussed on progressing  financial, technical and legal aspects of the project.  They encapsulate the continuation of the design development  and negotiations to enable the Irish Prison Service to contract with the PPP Company and commence construction of the prison facilities. While, as stated, negotiations on the contract are at an advanced stage they have not, however, reached the point that the Project Agreement can be signed.  Construction will commence after contract  award and should take no more than 3 years. This timeframe is subject, of course, to the successful completion of the contract negotiations. I can say, however, that if the current contract negotiations are not successfully concluded there are other options which can still be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Pressures on the international financial markets have the potential to impact on all major capital projects, including the Thornton Hall PPP project.  It is the responsibility of the commercial consortium, under the PPP process, to arrange the funding and other resources to deliver the project.  The Irish Prison Service is being advised by the National Development Finance Agency in relation to trends and developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">The cost of the acquisition of the site for the prison development was €29.9 million.  The cost of the site was largely offset by the sale of the prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main prison site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.  The cost of the additional land was €1.3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">A total of €10.3 million has been expended to end March 2009 on professional fees and preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security, site preparation and maintenance of the property.  As is the case in all major infrastructural projects, comprehensive geological, engineering and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site.</p>

Priority is given by the gardaí to intelligence-led operations targeting these groups commensurate with the threat posed.  These operations involve the strategic deployment of local and specialised resources as required.  Close co-operation exists at all levels between the Garda Síochána and its counterparts in Northern Ireland in the context of countering and investigating the activities of groups which pose a security threat.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_741">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1761">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has received the report from the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee for the year 2008.  That report has been translated in accordance with the provisions of the Official Languages Act, 2003 and I  am arranging to have it published as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">I wish to advise the Deputy that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months, where we have seen dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners and a trend towards longer sentences.  What is clear is that there is a trend of increased committals from the courts.  Figures show, over the past 12 months, the number in custody in Mountjoy has increased by 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. I acknowledge that our prisons are operating in excess of their bed capacity at this time.  Equally it is also clear that the continuation of the current capital programme is necessary if overcrowding is not to become a problem going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">Since 1997 in excess of 1,300 prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system. These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">However, given the serious pressure that the Prison Service has been experiencing during the last 12-18 months, in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit.  This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.  In addition, in 2008, 70 new prison spaces were introduced at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House Open Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">As the pressure shows no sign of abating the Irish Prison Service recently decided to increase their capacities through the doubling up of further cells, thus creating  200 additional temporary bed spaces which will come on stream shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">Furthermore, building projects in Castlerea, Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons are due to be completed in the coming months.  This will create an additional 400 extra spaces which will temporarily alleviate the situation pending the construction of new prisons at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin and Kilworth, Co. Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">I am fully conscious of the Irish Prison Service's responsibility to provide safe and secure custody for those placed into custody.  This is one of the main reasons for the introduction of recent security initiatives to combat contraband items being trafficked into prisons, one of the major challenges facing prisons worldwide. These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">airport style security screening using x-ray machines and scanning equipment,</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">the establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence and targeting specific security problem areas,</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">the establishment of a Drug Detection Dog Unit within the Irish Prison Service,</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">the installation of mobile phone blocking technology, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">the segregation of a number of serious drug and criminal gang members in a high security unit in Cloverhill Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">Airport style scanners and x-ray machines are now in operation at the entrances to all the relevant closed prisons.  Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches. These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  No visitors are permitted to enter prisons while in possession of a mobile phone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">I can also advise the Deputy that prison management, in order to ensure the safety of prisoners, immediately separate prisoners seeking protection from the general prison population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat. It is at the committal stage that the majority of prisoners seek protection.  External influences imported to the prison on committal include gang rivalry, drug debts and perceived cooperation with the Gardaí.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and based on the information available, a decision is made as to where a particular prisoner will be accommodated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1790">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the incident to which the Deputies refer remains the subject of an active and ongoing investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">Shortly after the incident a number of persons were arrested.  Charges have been preferred against two of those arrested, and these individuals are currently before the Courts.  A sum of money relating to these charges was also recovered, but, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to go into any further details about the matter.  The investigation is continuing with a number of lines of enquiry being pursued by the Investigation Team and an Investigation File is being prepared which will be submitted to the DPP in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">As I stated in the immediate aftermath of this robbery, I spoke to the Chief Executive of the institution and expressed my concern that such a large sum of money could be removed from the bank in this manner.  Several meetings have also taken place between An Garda Síochána and representatives from the financial institutions to discuss issues relating to their security arrangements, including the issue of so-called ‘tiger' kidnappings. There are agreed response procedures, which are detailed and all-encompassing, between An Garda Síochána and the financial institutions to deal with situations where members of staff or their families are taken hostage in order to facilitate robberies of such institutions.  An Garda Síochána does not, for obvious security reasons, disclose information relating to such procedures and protocols.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">I know that the members of this House will agree with me when I say that it is vitally important that financial institutions follow the robust procedures and protocols that are in place to prevent robberies.  These are there, first and foremost, to protect employees.  It is important to recognise that it is only by rendering so-called ‘tiger' kidnappings unsuccessful that we will stop them happening, and thereby protect innocent employees from being caught up in them in the future.</p>

        [14276/09]

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_756">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1833">I attach a high level of priority to ensuring that asylum applications are dealt with fairly and as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the cost to the State. The costs associated with the asylum system are multi-faceted but centre mainly on accommodation, application processing and operational costs and costs associated with judicial reviews. Inter-related factors include the numbers in the asylum system; the length of time taken to process claims and the impact of delays as a result of non co-operation by applicants; the high level of judicial reviews and the apparent abuse of that process in many instances by applicants seeking to prolong their stay in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">The cost of accommodating asylum applicants accounts for the bulk of the expenditure on asylum by my Department. In this regard, the direct provision system is an efficient means of accommodating asylum seekers. If this system was not in place the cost to the State of accommodating asylum seekers would be higher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">Various efficiency and cost reduction measures continue to be implemented across INIS with a view to reducing the costs associated with asylum applications. On the application processing side, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) keep processing times and scheduling arrangements under ongoing review with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation or decision, all of which impact on direct provision costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">Particular emphasis is placed on maximising the number of asylum cases transferred to other European States for processing under the Dublin II Regulation and an increased focus on the return of failed applicants to their countries of origin through deportations and voluntary return.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">There are also a range of other strategies in place aimed at tackling the various abuses of the asylum process and expediting the processing of asylum applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">Other efficiency and cost reduction measures being pursued to reduce asylum costs include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">implementation of the Government decision dated the 3 February, 2009 in relation to achieving an 8% reduction in spending on professional fees;</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">engagement with contractors for asylum seeker accommodation to achieve an 8% reduction in RIA expenditure;</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">commencement of Government agreed Value for Money (VFM) Review of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation;</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">implementation of strategies aimed at reducing asylum application numbers;</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">establishment of ORAC Presenting Panel and an on-line system of access to Tribunal decisions, both of which are intended to speed up appeal hearings and reduce backlogs in the RAT;</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">consolidating shared services related activities across INIS and redeploying resources to processing areas;</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">strategies aimed at reducing the delays and costs associated with Judicial Review proceedings, such as greater use of in-house training, expertise and precedents, resulting in less use of counsel; ongoing review of practices and procedures and quality-proofing of decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will be a key measure for achieving efficiencies in the asylum applications processing system itself, for establishing a more effective and streamlined removal process and for tackling abuses which the asylum and immigration system have to contend with, including apparent abuses of the judicial review system. The Bill comprehensively reforms and simplifies the current asylum system through the introduction of a single procedure for the investigation of all grounds put forward by applicants for protection. It is envisaged that there will be significant reductions in processing times upon enactment of the Bill, which will significantly reduce the costs involved in the asylum process.</p>

        <b>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</b>
         asked the

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that his Department and the Irish Prison Service awarded contracts worth €100 million to one construction company despite only one, €4.7 million, project going to tender; the steps he has taken in the past to prevent taxpayers money being wasted in the course of prison and other projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1856">The Accounting Officer and the Director General of the Irish Prison Service have briefed me in relation to all matters raised at the Public Accounts Committee hearing held in March.  In relation to contracts awarded to a particular construction company as referred to by the Deputy, I understand that this issue is the subject of a review by the Public Accounts Committee so it would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on the issues raised at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">The Irish Prison Service has taken several major steps in recent years in order to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved for all expenditure.  In March 2007, a new professionally trained Central Procurement Unit was established within the Irish Prison Service, with the stated purpose of modernising the procurement function and introducing new policies and procedures to ensure that enhanced controls are exercised over the procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Following consultation with internal stakeholders, the Irish Prison Service Procurement Policy was issued by the Director General in September 2008.  The Irish Prison Service Finance Directorate is engaged in an ongoing promotion and education process in relation to the Procurement Policy and related presentations have been made to staff at all levels within the organisation.  The issue of procurement and, in particular, adherence to the Procurement Policy, is an ongoing item on the agenda for senior management meetings.  During 2008, a number of key staff appointments were made to the Finance Directorate of the Irish Prison Service, including a Director with sole responsibility for Finance and Procurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">The Irish Prison Service is committed to ensuring that procurement is carried out in an open and transparent manner in line with best practice with the overriding principle of achieving value for money.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_761">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1861">I have already made it clear that recent trends concerning gangland violence in particular are a matter of grave concern and that I am giving priority to a series of new legislative measures directed specifically at this problem in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">The most recent crime statistics released by the CSO, in respect of 2008, show a number of encouraging trends.  There was a decrease of 42.9% in the number of homicide offences, which includes a decrease of 36.4% in murder and of 57.1% in manslaughter.  Aggravated sexual assault decreased by 33.3% and assault causing harm by 2.2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">The Garda Policing Plan for 2009, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by me as Minister, contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.  An Garda Síochána, in accordance with the priorities I have set, is committed to targeting violent crime and those who engage or facilitate persons involved in such activity.  One of these operations is Operation Anvil, the primary focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">Under the Operation, up to 22 March 2009, 2,469 firearms have been recovered throughout the country.  There have also been over 7,500 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary and over 72,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">At a time when the public finances are under pressure, I am determined that top priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million to enable it to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">The adequacy of our legislative provisions is kept under review and strengthened where necessary.  I have consequently recently published the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which is ground breaking legislation providing for the first time a legal framework to allow covert surveillance material to be used in trials for serious crimes with appropriate safeguards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">Since my appointment as Minister, I have expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  Some time ago, I directed my Department and An Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following that review, I have brought forward proposals.  While a <i>de facto</i> ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will also be given legislative form in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">Though legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is already very strong and heavy penalties are already in place, I am moving to strengthen the law in this area.  In that context, I sought and received proposals from the Garda Commissioner on strengthening the law on knife crime.  I have accepted these proposals and the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will take account of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">On 5 February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda Síochána with the objective of informing and educating young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.  In addition to these measures, I have directed the drafting of a new Firearms and Offensive Weapons Order which will deal with the issue of swords. In particular I will be banning the sale of samurai swords.</p>

        <b>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the quantity and value of seizures of heroin, cocaine, cannabis and other drugs here during 2007, 2008 and to date in 2009; the proportion of the overall flow of drugs into Ireland believed to be represented by these seizures; the new initiatives he is planning to control the flow of illegal drugs into the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_762">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1871">I am setting out in a tabular statement giving the latest available information in relation to drug seizures for 2007, 2008 and this year to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">This statement shows seizures of a total value of over €168m being made in 2007 and just under €200m in 2008.  Because of the covert nature of the activity, it is simply not possible to give a reliable estimate of the proportion of drugs coming into the country that these figures represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">While it is true that some international studies attempt to estimate the proportion of overall drugs seized to production, this is not a reliable guide to the situation in any particular country.  In particular, such figures cannot reflect increased enforcement levels in a country.  Through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, An Garda Síochána continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs and identify those involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">An Garda Síochána is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized in the last two years and again this year to date, there has been a significant impact on drug-trafficking by the arrest and prosecution of a number of major players involved and the activities of a number of crime gangs have been disrupted, resulting in a number of crime groupings being dismantled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">In addition to the officers of the Force specifically assigned to the drugs issue who are attached to the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional Drug Units, officers from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau all assist in our overall law enforcement response to drug trafficking and drug dealing.  In addition, the Garda work closely with Customs and the Naval Service under the umbrella of the Joint Task Force on Drugs as well as with their international colleagues in tackling the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">Among recent and ongoing initiatives are the establishment of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent footing, our involvement in the establishment and operation of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon, strengthened provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 and the ringfencing of €21million this year for Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">I am confident that the legislation that I have introduced dealing with surveillance will be of particular value in tackling drugs gangs.  I am sure all Members of the House will accept fully that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone.  We need to tackle the demand for drugs and, in this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, are co-operating fully in the development of the new National Drugs Strategy for the period  2009 to 2016 which is being drawn up under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

         the implications for the management of policing projects such as the new community policing model and major operations such as those into the Crumlin-Drimnagh and Limerick gangland feuds and so on, of the recently introduced pension levy, cuts to overtime, recruitment and promotions embargo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1956">I am informed by the Commissioner that the introduction of the recent levy as a result of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act does not impact on any policing operations of An Garda Síochána and also that the maximum amount of policing resources have been allocated to front line policing and that overtime budgets are primarily focused on intelligence led, time limited operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">In this regard the Deputy should be aware that despite pressure on resources, funding for Operation Anvil has increased in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million.  In addition to this the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána is expected to reach approximately 14,900 by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">The Commissioner has committed to the introduction of community policing in all 112 districts in the country.  For some districts this will be a new initiative while for others a re-invigoration of the existing community policing structure will be required.  The roll out is supported by a robust Implementation Plan developed by the Community Policing Implementation Team at Garda Community Relations Division.  A comprehensive Strategic ‘Action Plan' has been developed for the successful implementation of the Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">Intelligence-led operations are used to target organised crime groups by utilising specialist units including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Organised Crime Unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  Targeted intelligence-led operations such as Operation Anvil continue to result in significant seizures of firearms and property related to criminal activity and have led to the arrests and prosecutions of those involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1966">On 25 March, 2009 the European Commission published a Proposal for a Framework Decision on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Protecting Victims repealing a Framework Decision agreed in 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings.  The primary purpose of this Proposal is to repeal and re-enact the 2002 Framework Decision with additional criminal law provisions to bring them in line with other international instruments.  The proposal also contains additional non-legislative provisions.  The new elements primarily deal with victim support, prevention, investigation, prosecution and monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">The question of establishing an informal EU Network of National Rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms on trafficking in human beings is also being considered at present.  Information regarding immigration related criminality is collated, analysed and disseminated by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), including such information and intelligence received, on a regular basis, through the Europol and Interpol National Units, based at Garda Headquarters.  In particular, personnel from the GNIB assist in investigations relating to the suspected trafficking and smuggling of persons, initiated in other jurisdictions, where it is suspected either the suspect(s) or victim(s) have entered this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">Members of the Garda Síochána, in particular personnel attached to the National Support Services attend courses organised by CEPOL (the European Police College) concerning trafficking in human beings which are targeted at:</p>

            <p eId="para_1972">The next training course is due to take place in Lithuania in May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">Ireland attends the Europol Expert meeting on trafficking in human beings which takes place on an annual basis. This meeting allows Member States to share their experiences and provide operational case examples of trafficking in human Beings.  Ireland is part of a number of Europol Analytical Work Files which provide both strategic and operational support.  In this context a trafficking in human beings bulletin is circulated on a quarterly basis which is disseminated to members of the Garda Síochána.  Other support provided to Ireland by Europol includes expert advice, intelligence reports, training and information exchange through the Europol Information System/Europol National Unit.  Operational support can include operational analysis of investigations in Member States, coordination of investigations (e.g. organisation of meetings at Europol) and support from other Europol National Units, which in Ireland is based at Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park.</p>

            <p eId="para_2005">The primary responsibility for health and safety in private-sector workplaces does not rest with the State. It rests with those who control such workplaces and those who work in them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">The basic law governing health and safety at work is to be found in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) and Regulations made under it, including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 299 of 2007).  There is also a body of sector-specific legislation which applies to Mines namely the Mines and Quarries Act 1965 (No. 7 of 1965) and Regulations made under it as well as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Extractive Industries) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 467 of 1997).</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">In line with a process concluded in 2007 in relation to the quarrying sector, which resulted in revised Regulations, proposals for the rationalisation of mining legislation are currently being developed by the Health and Safety Authority.  Under the current health and safety legislation for the sector, it is the duty of the manager of a mine to take such steps as are necessary to facilitate below ground ventilation in the mine for the purposes of (i) diluting gases that are inflammable or noxious so as to render them harmless and removing them, and (ii) providing air containing a sufficiency of oxygen.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">Due to the complex nature of mining operations and the potential for multiple fatalities from major incidents — such as from fire below ground, inrush and collapse — the Health and Safety Authority has specialist mining inspectors to carry out inspections at mines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">The Mines and Quarries Act 1965 provides that where a Health and Safety Authority inspector is of opinion that in the interests of the safety or health of the persons employed, it is necessary or expedient to improve the ventilation produced in any part of that mine that is required to be ventilated, the inspector may serve on the manager of the mine a notice requiring either that (i) ventilation which is produced in that part of the mine must conform to specified requirements, or (ii) works for the purpose of improving the ventilation in that part of the mine are put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">In excess of 1,500 inspections have been carried out by the Health and Safety Authority in the Mines and Quarries sector over the past three years.  The total number of enforcement actions was 164, in addition to 555 written advices.  Further details can be found in the Authority's Annual Reports which are public documents.  As the number of quarries far exceeds the number of operational mines, of which there are four underground mines currently operating in Ireland, the number of specific mining inspections were 24 in the years 2006 and 2007.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2016">FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, aims to offer a wide range of training courses and delivery methods to suit individual client needs in the development of their skill-sets.  In 2009 the Authority estimates that they will be in a position to deliver 6,062 training courses under the Training Services, Community Services and Services to Business categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">Courses will continue to be adapted to address a changing labour market and, in this respect, FÁS has enhanced the traditional course offerings of specific skills training (SST's) to now include Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses as well as Community Based courses. The suite of Short Courses recently developed and expanded by FÁS typically consist of a Preparing for Work Module, which includes Job Seeking and Interview Skills, and one or two technical modules.  The Short Course Programme will be delivered through In-Centre Training and Contracted Training.  The decision on which courses to offer in a Region will take place based on demand through a process of consultation between Training Services, Employment Services and Services to Business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">While waiting times vary considerably at individual course level a recent customer survey conducted on behalf of FÁS indicated that the average waiting time (between applying for a course and starting) in 2008 was 7.7 weeks compared with 9.7 weeks in 2007.  The size of waiting lists across the different course categories very much depends on the course type, duration and capacity and location of the course.  Short courses on average run every 4-9 weeks which reduces the wait list and increases capacity compared to a traditional course running over a 16 week period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">Courses, where FÁS is the prime recruiter, are broadly classified into 15 main categories and are shown in the following table for the Deputy's information.</p>

            <p eId="para_2038">The current body of employment rights legislation, which includes transposition of EU Directives into domestic law, applies to employees or persons with contracts of service and does not apply to persons with contracts for services i.e. self-employed.  As this legislation provides for the rights of employees in relation to their employment with an employer, it would not make sense for it to apply to the self-employed as autonomous persons.  The rationale for such legislation applying to employees or persons with contracts of service only is that employees could be vulnerable in their employment relationship with an employer.  Accordingly, there would not be any logic in applying to the self-employed employment rights legislation such as the Unfair Dismissal Acts, the Carer's Leave Act or the Redundancy Payments Acts etc.  In the circumstances there are no proposals to introduce legislation to apply employment rights legislation to persons with contracts for services.</p>

            <p eId="para_2040">The huge increase in the number of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department in the latter part of 2008 and, to date in 2009 is unprecedented and is giving rise to delays in the processing of redundancy payments for individuals and companies within a reasonable timeframe.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics which indicate that, at the end of the first quarter of 2009, the number of new claims lodged with my Department was 19,742 which equates to almost 50% of the entire level of applications lodged for the whole of 2008 i.e. 40,607.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">While measures are being taken to address the backlog of claims applications, including the allocation of additional staff resources to the area, the volume of work on hand is such that very significant slippage has occurred in the timeframes for processing redundancy claims as against the targets which the Department originally set itself.  The Department's website at <i>www.entemp.ie </i>which is updated regularly, gives information on the month from which claims are being processed.  Currently, the Redundancy Payments Section is finalising on-line rebate claims to employers received in November 2008 and manual claims for October 2008.  Every effort is being made to deal with the backlog of claims and to improve the turnaround time for processing claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_2075">The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport.  We would like to see the SR Technics Group do what it can to facilitate this, such as helping to promote the capabilities and skills available at the Dublin facility, agreeing to an orderly wind down of the facility to give IDA Ireland an opportunity to promote the location to interested parties, and maintaining assets and equipment at the site.  I have conveyed these points, and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at Group level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have formed a project team to promote the operation through the IDA overseas network of offices and to meet with and assess expressions of interest in the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in acquiring at least elements of the business and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively exploring options with interested parties.  Time is needed to assess these proposals by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The State agencies will continue to engage with all groups, indigenous and overseas, interested in building commercially viable and sustainable operations to secure as many of the jobs as possible at Dublin Airport.</p>

            <p eId="para_2413">Normally, employees receive their redundancy entitlements from their employer.  Employers are then entitled to apply to the Department for a rebate of 60% of the statutory element of the redundancy payments made.  If, at this stage, an employer submits a claim which is incomplete, the Department will seek the necessary information from the employer.  In these circumstances, employees will normally suffer no delay as they should already have received their redundancy payment.  The delay in these cases caused by incomplete claims will result in the employer not getting a rebate until all information is received.  The period of time involved depends in each case on how quickly the employer responds with full information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">Where an employer is not in a position to pay the statutory lump sum, my Department pays the statutory amount from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) to individual employees and seeks reimbursement of 40% of the total payments from the employer.  When an employer is not in a position to pay statutory redundancy, the Redundancy Payments Section requires proof of inability to pay.  The employer is asked to provide a letter from his Accountant or Solicitor confirming inability to pay together with documentary evidence (i.e Audited Accounts/Statement of Affairs) within 30 days of issue of the communication.  Where an employer does not provide the information requested or refuses to pay within the agreed timeframe, the employee is advised to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer, seeking a determination of their entitlement to statutory redundancy.  The average waiting period for a case to be heard before the EAT is, I understand, currently around 27 weeks.</p>

As part of its analysis, the task force is meeting with and obtaining inputs from all the relevant State Development Agencies, including the IDA.  I have asked the Task Force to provide me with an interim report on their findings and this is likely to be completed in May.</p>

These potential investments are being pursued and IDA Ireland will do everything possible to speed up the investment decisions in Limerick's favour.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2435">The cycle to work scheme came into operation on 1 Jan 2009. The purposes of the scheme are to encourage more employees to cycle to and from work, to contribute to lowering carbon emissions, to help reduce traffic congestion, and to help improve health and fitness levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">The scheme allows an employer to provide an employee with a bicycle (including an electrically assisted bicycle) and cycle safety equipment, e.g. helmet, lights, reflective clothing, as a benefit of his/her employment without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation.  The scheme applies where the bicycle is used by the employee for travelling to and from work or for travelling between workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">The scheme can be implemented through salary sacrifice arrangements in a similar manner to the existing Travel Pass Scheme.  Under such an arrangement, the employer provides the bicycle and/or safety equipment to the employee who agrees to forego or sacrifice part of his or her salary every pay period in order to cover the cost of the bicycle and safety equipment.  Any salary sacrifice arrangement must be completed within a maximum period of twelve months and the arrangement will be reflected in the employee's pay over that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">The bicycle and safety equipment up to the value of €1,000 are exempt from benefit-in-kind taxation under the scheme.  Employees will not be liable to income tax, employee PRSI, or levies on the cost of the bicycle and safety equipment up to this limit.  Where the cost exceeds this amount, a BIK charge will apply to the balance.  The scheme is available to individual employees once only in a five year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">The employer will also benefit in that employer PRSI is not payable on the cost of the bicycle and/or safety equipment.  Employers will not, however, be able to reclaim the VAT paid on the bicycle and/or safety equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">Participation in the scheme is voluntary for employers.  However, when an employer agrees to participate, he or she must make the scheme generally available, on an equal basis, to all employees requesting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">There is no notification procedure for employers to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that they are operating the scheme.  However, the purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees will be subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. invoices, salary sacrifice agreements between employer and employee, such agreements to include a statement from employees that the bicycle and safety equipment are for their own use and will be used for travelling to and from work).</p>
            <p eId="para_2442">The cycle to work scheme is effectively available since 1 January 2009 to private sector employees where employers agree to operate the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2443">Implementation of the scheme in the civil service is being dealt with by my Department.  Introducing the scheme in the civil service has given rise to a number of issues including that of public procurement.  These issues will be resolved shortly. I also understand that the Office of Public Works will be advertising in the near future seeking expressions of interest from those selling bicycles and pedelecs (electrically assisted bicycles), and who are prepared to supply bicycles and cycle safety equipment to those availing of the scheme in the civil service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2444">A circular providing for a scheme in the civil service will be issued as soon as practicable and those arrangements should provide a framework for the implementation of a similar scheme in the wider public service.</p>

            <p eId="para_2446">With regard to the VAT applied to domestic water softening units, or indeed any other goods and services, it is important to bear in mind that the VAT treatment of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, it is not possible to apply the reduced rate of VAT to water softening units which are subject to the standard 21.5% VAT rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2447">However, I would point out that the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may currently be applied to products which are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2452">The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2 May 2002, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Schedule 4 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non-rateable under the Act, including buildings occupied by a charitable organisation and used exclusively by that organisation for charitable purposes and otherwise than for profit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">In the case of the valuation of premises occupied by Clondrohid Community Childcare, I am informed by the Valuation Office that a Revision Officer has been appointed following a request from Cork County Council to revise the valuation. In considering the request, the revision officer will examine all aspects of the case, including the occupier's claim for exemption.  In this regard, I might mention that the grant of charitable status to an organisation does not of itself entitle that organisation to an exemption from rates.  The nature of the occupation and use of the premises and the particular terms and conditions of the organisation's Memorandum and Articles of Association will be determining factors in whether the premises occupied by the organisation will be exempt or not.  Before a definitive decision is made in the case, the occupiers of the premises in Clondrohid will be afforded an opportunity by the Revision Officer to make Representations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2454">If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance, and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.

         if measures will be taken to request financial institutions, in view of current financial and economic circumstances, to allow mortgage holders who are on fixed rate mortgages to move to variable rate mortgages without incurring a severe financial penalty to do so.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_798">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2496">The Deputy's question refers to the redemption fee applied by mortgage providers in circumstances that a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage. Mortgage lenders in Ireland generally seek to recover costs of funds when a borrower with a fixed rate mortgage agreement seeks to terminate the agreement some time before the term agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">Traditionally redemption fees were articulated with the institution specifying that a given number of months interest would apply. Overtime, they have generally moved towards a mechanism which reflects the difference between the contracted rate and current market rates applied to the amount outstanding for the remaining fixed period. Where a redemption fee is payable on a housing loan the mortgage agent has to inform the consumer about it at the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">Compensation sought by the lender reflects the cost to the institution of obtaining the funds on the capital market at a certain cost, as against selling them on at a related price.  Institutions fund the fixed rate agreement through funding on markets, generally through interest rate swaps.  This allows them to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where the borrower seeks to repay the loan before the contractually agreed fixed term in an environment where interest rates have declined, the institution is exposed to re-investment risk, i.e., it will be unable to re-lend the funds at a rate related to their cost, due to intervening market fluctuations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">Ireland is relatively unusual in the EU context in that borrowers have an absolute legal right to repay their loan early as set out in Section 121(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  However Section 121 goes on to recognise that while a consumer will not be liable to pay an early redemption fee with respect to a variable rate loan, this exemption from redemption fees does not apply where the rate of interest is fixed or is fixed for one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the preparations for the EU White Paper on Mortgage Market Integration, which was published in December 2007, the Mortgage Industry and Consumer Expert Group agreed that lenders should receive a compensation when a consumer repays his or her fixed rate loan earlier than at its contractual termination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgage and it would not be advisable to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator on the subject of customers who wish to switch from a fixed rate mortgage.  On foot of that my Department has contacted the Financial Regulator to request confirmation that the redemption costs for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included in these charges.  The Financial Regulator has confirmed to my Department that it is looking into this matter and that it will revert shortly.  I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the Financial Regulator's consideration of this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2512">In the circumstances and given that there is no provision in taxation, social welfare or health legislation to offset tax liabilities in the manner suggested, it is not possible to offset the 60% statutory redundancy rebates against a tax liability due to Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2515">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question contacted his local tax district in March 2009 to inform them that he had received payment of a pension from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The pension covered the period from July 2008 to March 2009 and was subjected to the PAYE emergency tax procedures, as the taxpayer had not applied for a PAYE Tax Credit Certificate when he became entitled to receive the pension. A PAYE Tax Credit Certificate has been issued to the taxpayer for 2009 and, once processed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the emergency procedures will cease and have the effect of refunding some or all of the tax suffered by the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">The reason that the taxpayer's affairs cannot be fully regularised until the end of 2009 is that a return of all income earned in 2008 will be required which should include the portion of his pension earned in 2008 but not paid by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until 2009 and subjected to tax in 2009.  In order to regularise the taxpayer's affairs it will be necessary to review both the 2008 and 2009 tax years as some of the pension paid in 2009 is properly assessable in 2008 while the tax deducted is due in 2009.  This review cannot be carried out until the end of 2009.</p>

Institutions fund the fixed rate agreement through funding on markets, generally through interest rate swaps. This allows them to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where the borrower seeks to repay the loan before the contractually agreed fixed term in an environment where interest rates have declined, the institution is exposed to re-investment risk, i.e., it will be unable to re-lend the funds at a rate related to their cost, due to intervening market fluctuations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">Ireland is relatively unusual in the EU context in that borrowers have an absolute legal right to repay their loan early as set out in Section 121(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. However Section 121 goes on to recognise that while a consumer will not be liable to pay an early redemption fee with respect to a variable rate loan, this exemption from redemption fees does not apply where the rate of interest is fixed or is fixed for one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the preparations for the EU White Paper on Mortgage Market Integration, which was published in December 2007, the Mortgage Industry and Consumer Expert Group agreed that lenders should receive a compensation when a consumer repays his or her fixed rate loan earlier than at its contractual termination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgage and it would not be advisable to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator on the subject of customers who wish to switch from a fixed rate mortgage. On foot of that my Department has contacted the Financial Regulator to request confirmation that the redemption costs for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included in these charges. The Financial Regulator has confirmed to my Department that it is looking into this matter and that it will revert shortly. I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the Financial Regulator's consideration of this matter.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2532">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of increasing annoyance and frustration on the part of accountants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">Revenue operates a network of formal contacts with tax practitioners ranging from the Taxes Administration Liaison Committee (TALC) to local Revenue and Practitioner forums. TALC was established in 1989 and is a liaison committee between Revenue, the Irish Taxation Institute (ITI), the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies of Ireland (CCAB-I) and the Law Society of Ireland. TALC is a forum for consultation and discussion between Revenue and practitioners on a wide variety of issues concerning the administration of tax in Ireland and meets regularly throughout the year.  Regular meetings at Regional and District level between Revenue staff and local tax practitioner and their representatives further support TALC dialogue. Given such a wide network of contacts, Revenue would have expected to be made aware of such annoyance and frustration, but this is not the case. TALC produces practical suggestions for improved administration on an ongoing basis. For example, at the TALC meeting on 17 April, streamlined processes for issuing tax refunds to businesses were discussed and agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">In recent years Revenue has made many charges in the way it does business:</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">The Revenue Online Service (ROS) now allows tax accountants to file tax returns and pay their taxes on line. This has greatly streamlined the whole business of tax filing, the main point of contact between Revenue and tax professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">Revenue has simplified tax administration; for example, reducing the number of VAT returns for smaller businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">A new service, the Revenue Technical Service was set up to answer difficult tax queries from tax practitioners. Many more examples of simplification could be given. In 2006, Revenue surveyed small and medium-sized businesses and found that 84% of respondents were either "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with the service they get from Revenue. According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers/World Bank report "Paying Taxes 2009-The Global Picture", Ireland is the sixth ‘easiest' country (out of 181 countries surveyed) in which to pay taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">While there is always room for improvement, I'm satisfied that Revenue is alert to the needs of business and has mechanisms in place to identify those needs, and is willing to respond where possible having regard to the necessary checks and balances to ensure compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">However, if the Deputy is aware of a particular issue, that matter should be brought to the attention of Revenue in one of the fora mentioned above.</p>

            <p eId="para_2543">Under statutory pension schemes and pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners there is no liability to  income tax in respect of retirement gratuities or lump sums paid to members of such schemes on retirement. Provided the individual referred to in the question is a member of such a scheme and the lump sum payment complies with Revenue rules in this area, there is no liability to income tax on the retirement lump sum payment. In this regard, it should be noted that the tax arrangements for retirement lump sums apply in respect of pension schemes in both the public and private sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">As I mentioned in my Budget Speech on 7 April last, the Commission on Taxation is examining various aspects of pension tax treatment, including the treatment of retirement lump sum payments and I expect to be dealing with the Commissions' recommendations in the 2010 Budget in December.</p>

            <p eId="para_2546">I am conscious of the difficulties being encountered in the farm machinery business in conjunction with other businesses, however, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the Budget 2009 policy decision of increasing the standard VAT rate continues to be necessary in order to support the public finances. We are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">Regarding the differential in VAT rates resulting from temporary reduction in the UK standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% up to the end of 2009, as recognised by the farm machinery industry in their correspondence, the VAT rate is not the only factor in the price differential between North and South of the border. The weakening of sterling has had, and is having, a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">Regarding the validity of VAT registration numbers, this forms part of the checks carried out by Revenue officers, including with their counterparts in Revenue &amp; Customs in the UK, and in Northern Ireland in particular,  in connection with audits and assurance checks where risk or suspicions arise.  These checks are carried out using the EU VAT Mutual Assistance Programme, which is designed specifically to tackle cross-border VAT fraud.  This programme allows for exchanges of information between EU Member States in relation to VAT matters and also allows the presence of officials from a Member State in another Member State while enquiries are being carried out.  These are VAT anti-fraud measures and Ireland plays a full role in the exchange of information with all other Member EU States, including the UK, with whom we have a good working relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">Checks of the control procedures in place between the State and Northern Ireland will continue as part of Revenue's work programmes in 2009. Revenue will continue to liaise, as appropriate, with the competent authorities in Northern Ireland, under the EU Mutual Assistance programme.  Any specific allegations regarding the abuse of VAT numbers will be investigated fully. Regarding to the availability of financing, the Deputy will be aware that as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February 2009, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10%. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. The banks will make quarterly reports, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">Government Departments and State agencies have engaged with banks and business representatives in a variety of settings on issues surrounding the flow of credit for business. A formal structure for those contacts on an ongoing basis will be finalised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy, which will inform future policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2559">The position is that statutory redundancy payments are exempt from both income tax and income levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">In addition, ex-gratia redundancy payments in excess of the statutory redundancy amount are exempt from income tax and the income levy, subject to certain limits, namely—</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">a basic exemption of €10,160 plus €765 per complete year of service in excess of statutory redundancy; or</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">if more beneficial, the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit, which is 1/15th of the person's annual income (average of the last three years) for each year of employment less any tax-free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2563">The basic exemption from income tax and income levy as outlined above can be further increased by up to €10,000 if the person is not a member of an occupational pension scheme. This can only be claimed if the person has not made any claim in respect of a lump sum received in the previous 10 tax years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2564">The amount of redundancy payment in excess of whichever exemption applies is liable to both income tax and income levy. The income levy rates announced in the Supplementary Budget, namely, 1.67% on the first €75,036, 3% on the next €25,064, 3.33% on the next €74,880, 4.67% on the next €75,140 and 5% on the remainder, apply to the whole of a person's 2009 income.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">With regard to an individual who took voluntary redundancy at the end of December and received the termination or lump sum payment associated with that redundancy before 1 January 2009, the person will not be liable to the income levy on that payment.  However if the termination payment was actually made on any date on or after 1 January 2009, then the person is liable to the income levy on that payment on the basis set out above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2566">The treatment of taxable redundancy payments paid prior to 1 May will be considered in the context of the preparation of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_2593">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when DIRT exempt accounts were introduced in April 2007, the initiative was widely publicised.  Publicity measures included the production and dissemination of two information leaflets; the first DE1 was for account holders who qualified on the basis of being aged 65 years, while the second DE2 was for those who qualified on the basis of permanent incapacitation.  These leaflets provided comprehensive information for qualifying taxpayers on how to have interest credited without deduction of DIRT.  The application forms and information leaflets were made available in Revenue offices and in financial institutions.  In 2007, Revenue arranged for information to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of state pensions, which resulted in 100,000 information leaflets being sent out in conjunction with other information being circulated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">I am further informed that in 2008 Revenue produced and circulated over 2,550 information posters about DIRT exempt accounts for those aged 65 years and over.  The posters were circulated for display in Citizens Information Offices, banks, post offices and in Revenue's local public offices.  Irish versions of the posters were also printed and circulated.  Revenue also provided briefing material to relevant interested parties including the Senior Times magazine and Age Action Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">Information about DIRT exempt accounts is also available on the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  Provisional figures show that in 2008 73,738 DIRT free deposit accounts were operated, which demonstrates the satisfactory arrangements which have been made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2602">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have a range of information available to taxpayers in relation to their entitlements to claim tax refunds if they are unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">The Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i> contains a wide range of information in relation to how claims can be made and what information customers need in order to make a claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">At the start of each tax year, the Revenue Commissioners send all taxpayers a tax credit certificate which sets out their tax credits and their standard rate band.  When sending out the 2009 tax credit certificates, the Revenue Commissioners included a booklet PAYE for Employees.  This 16 page booklet about the PAYE system included 2 pages of information about changing jobs and what to do in relation to a possible tax refund if a taxpayer is out of work.  The booklet was sent to over 2.2 million taxpayers in November and December 2008 in advance of the start of the tax year.  The information was presented in an easy-to-read format in booklet form in order that PAYE taxpayers would use it as a handy reference guide about the tax system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">Regarding the specific question about people who become unemployed, I am advised that this is handled in a very direct way. When a person becomes unemployed, their employer provides them with Form P45 which includes information in the section titled "Important Notes for Employee" about what a taxpayer should do if unemployed and claiming a tax repayment.  Taxpayers who are unemployed and claiming a tax repayment are advised to send parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Form P45, with a completed Form P50, to their local Revenue Office. I am fully satisfied with this arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2606">Furthermore, Revenue operates a Lo Call 1890 telephone service for PAYE taxpayers taking between 6,000 and 12,000 calls per day, depending on the time of year.  Information on unemployment refunds is available from the Lo Call service.</p>

However, from 2010 the surplus is eliminated and a cumulative deficit is forecast for the SIF. The total SIF resources available to meet SIF expenditure will therefore be lower than in 2009, with the Appropriation-in-Aid figure being reduced accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2719">The position is that Mortgage Interest Relief for principal private residencies will cease for all mortgages from the 1st May, where the mortgage holder has been in receipt of mortgage interest tax relief for more than seven years. The exception to this rule is where a new loan has been taken out in the last seven years for the purpose of buying a new home or for the purposes of repair, development or improvement of their current home.</p>
            <p eId="para_2720">The fixing of the rate of interest on an existing mortgage does not, in itself, constitute a new qualifying loan. In the circumstances outlined in both of these questions, no exemption from the abolition of the relief is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2722">Government Departments and State agencies have engaged with banks and business representatives in a variety of settings on issues surrounding the flow of credit for business. A formal structure for those contacts on an ongoing basis will be finalised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March. This code will apply to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints. Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice. This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">In addition, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. The banks will make quarterly reports, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009. Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2725">An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.</p>

This Government through its policies, including the development of a relatively low taxation regime for business, has created an attractive environment for investment. Significant additional support continues to be made available to investors, primarily through agencies under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, which encourage investment, by both domestic and foreign investors.</p>

Accordingly the significance of Monday/Friday absences may be less than otherwise would be the case.  In the timescale given, it is not possible to identify the number of sick days taken on a Friday or Monday in each of the years concerned.

            <p eId="para_2800">As the Deputy is aware, the 0.5% increase in the standard VAT rate from 21% to 21.5% was introduced in the 2009 Budget as part of a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services.  The UK Government, as part of a fiscal stimulus package, then reduced their standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">It would appear that the timing of Ireland's VAT increase, given the subsequent temporary reduction in the UK rate, may have sent the wrong signal to consumers.  However, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the Budget 2009 policy decision of increasing the VAT rate continues to be necessary in order to support the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">We are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.  As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.</p>

Our debate on that occasion made clear the need to introduce the pension-related deduction in the light of the severe budgetary constraints we are experiencing taking account of the nature and quality of public service pension terms generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">The means tests for FIS purposes and for medical card qualification take into account the pension-related deduction for public servants.  A quantification of public servants who may have means slightly above the current income thresholds is not possible but the number is not estimated to be of such a scale as to call into question the impact on the Exchequer.  The recent Supplementary Budget change will also reduce any effect on these means tests qualifications.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2831">The Deputy's question refers to the redemption fee applied by mortgage providers in circumstances that a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage. Mortgage lenders in Ireland generally seek to recover costs of funds when a borrower with a fixed rate mortgage agreement seeks to terminate the agreement some time before the term agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">Traditionally redemption fees were articulated with the institution specifying that a given number of months interest would apply. Overtime, they have generally moved towards a mechanism which reflects the difference between the contracted rate and current market rates applied to the amount outstanding for the remaining fixed period. Where a redemption fee is payable on a housing loan the mortgage agent has to inform the consumer about it at the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_2833">Compensation sought by the lender reflects the cost to the institution of obtaining the funds on the capital market at a certain cost, as against selling them on at a related price. Institutions fund the fixed rate agreement through funding on markets, generally through interest rate swaps. This allows them to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where the borrower seeks to repay the loan before the contractually agreed fixed term in an environment where interest rates have declined, the institution is exposed to re-investment risk, i.e., it will be unable to re-lend the funds at a rate related to their cost, due to intervening market fluctuations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">Ireland is relatively unusual in the EU context in that borrowers have an absolute legal right to repay their loan early as set out in Section 121(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. However Section 121 goes on to recognise that while a consumer will not be liable to pay an early redemption fee with respect to a variable rate loan, this exemption from redemption fees does not apply where the rate of interest is fixed or is fixed for one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the preparations for the EU White Paper on Mortgage Market Integration, which was published in December 2007, the Mortgage Industry and Consumer Expert Group agreed that lenders should receive a compensation when a consumer repays his or her fixed rate loan earlier than at its contractual termination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgage and it would not be advisable to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator on the subject of customers who wish to switch from a fixed rate mortgage. On foot of that my Department has contacted the Financial Regulator to request confirmation that the redemption costs for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included in these charges. The Financial Regulator has confirmed to my Department that it is looking into this matter and that it will revert shortly. I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the Financial Regulator's consideration of this matter.</p>

While this relief has not been abolished, with effect from 1st May 2009, its availability will be restricted to the first seven years of any qualifying loan.  I also stated that, as house prices fall, the provision of Mortgage Interest Relief will be kept under review with a view to eventual abolition.  The Commission on Taxation are reviewing this, along with the rest of the taxation system, and I expect to receive their recommendations later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">Should any future decision be taken to abolish Mortgage Interest Relief, those taxpayers that already have qualifying loans will continue to have access to the relief until the 7 year limit is reached.</p>

            <p eId="para_2853">The Government and the HSE remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk. Minister Andrews has personally chaired regular meetings between officials from his Office and senior child welfare and protection managers in the HSE aimed at improving the provision of services to children at risk.  A key component of these discussions has been the provision of out of hours care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">In this context, the HSE is now putting in place a standardised national system whereby Gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This service will conform with Child Care Regulations and with the National Foster Care Standards.  The provision of this service aims to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting.  Foster families are currently being recruited with a view to commencing the service on or before 1 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated approach which builds on the HSE's existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  This should provide a more effective and integrated service by using existing resources and strengthening the links between services such as mental health and social work to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours.  The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_2867">‘A Vision for Change' the Report on the Expert Group on Mental Health recommended that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be re-invested in the new mental health service infrastructure requirement.  The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have agreed in principle to the release of the proceeds of the disposal of properties prior to 2006 for reinvestment in mental health capital development.  The arrangements for property disposal require Department of Finance approval in each case, the lodging of the proceeds as Exchequer Extra Receipts and the re-Voting of the funds for approved projects.  Disposals to date amount to over €42m and a submission detailing the projects to be funded from these disposals was received from the HSE on 12 February last.  At a meeting between officials from my Department and the HSE to discuss the matter, it was agreed that the HSE would forward a revised submission to my Department and this is expected shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2868">In relation to the recruitment of a National Director of Mental Health Services, the Health Service Executive has responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  However, it has been made clear to the HSE on a number of occasions, most recently by the Independent Monitoring Group in its annual report published this week, that the most effective way to bring about the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change' would be for a senior person to be assigned at national level with specific responsibility for delivering on reform in the mental health services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2875">I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 344 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January, 2009.  A core principle of the Hague Convention is that inter-country adoption should be child-centred — that is, in all stages of the process, the child's interests must be paramount.  Legislating for inter-country adoption is essential to give protection to children during the process of adoption.  The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between States to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction.  As a receiving country, it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention provide an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that inter-country adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention, and from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards.  As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries that continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care which cannot be provided domestically.  We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bi-lateral agreements with a small number of countries, including Ethiopia and the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">As regards the Russian Federation, my Office is undertaking preparatory work to consider the contents of such an agreement, including anticipating the likely requirements of the Russian Federation.  While every effort will be made to conclude a bi-lateral agreement with countries from which children have traditionally been adopted by Irish applicants, in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Governments of these sovereign States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">However, at this point in time, it is my priority to endeavour to ensure that an international bi-lateral agreement with Vietnam is put in place as soon as possible, to maintain the continuity of arrangements between Ireland and Vietnam in relation to inter-country adoption.  In this regard, I am pleased to inform the House that an Irish delegation is currently in Hanoi — the earliest opportunity provided to meet with the relevant Vietnamese Ministries — for an intensive round of discussions on this draft Bi-lateral Agreement.  The delegation is being led by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who will be assisted in discussions by the Adoption Board.  Ireland has a long and positive relationship with Vietnam, but I must also emphasise the need to respect the authority of that jurisdiction, having regard to the sensitive nature of discussions regarding inter-country adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">As the Deputy is aware, requests for assessment for inter-country adoption are continuously increasing.  The Study on Inter-country Adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for inter-country adoption in Europe.  It is against this background that the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks that will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">A family that wishes to adopt should be recognised beforehand as being able to promote, safeguard and support the development and well-being of a child in need of adoption in a lasting manner.  However, it is acknowledged that persons applying for inter-country adoption are experiencing delays as regards waiting times for assessment, and that there are also concerns regarding the standardisation of the service across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">It should be noted that the increasing numbers of children adopted from abroad create additional pressures on inter-country adoption teams within the HSE.  This is because these same teams provide post-adoption reports to the sending countries, at the request of those countries, with the agreement of the adoptive parents.  This is an important component in the willingness of countries to consider Irish applicants for adoption. It is also important to note that subsequent to undergoing an assessment with the HSE, and to receiving the Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability from the Adoption Board, applicants must then wait before receiving a referral for a child from the sending country.  The waiting times for referral are outside the jurisdiction of both the HSE and the Adoption Board and are dependant on the regulations that each individual country has with regard to inter-country adoption.  I would like to assure you that attention is being given to this issue by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system that is provided on a timely, fair and transparent basis.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2895">The Community Child care Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006 -2010 for which I have responsibility.  With regard to the proposals received by the Deputy in relation to the CCSS, the following is the position.  The objective of both the previous support schemes under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP), and the CCSS, has been to provide funding to community child care services to enable them to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.   Under the previous scheme, participating services were required to charge tiered fees based on ability to pay, however, many of them did not implement this requirement. Under the CCSS, specific subvention rates have been set with 3 categories of parents benefiting from subvented fee rates and parents who do not qualify for subvention paying the full economic cost of their child care places(s).  Neither scheme provides for core funding and to do so would be discriminatory <i>vis-à-vis</i> commercial child care providers who cannot benefit from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">The CCSS is a targeted scheme  available only to services provided in community child care facilities, and the Deputy's proposal to set Band C eligibility by reference to the average industrial wage would, therefore, be discriminatory to the majority of parents using commercial child care services and who are not benefiting from the scheme.  Also eligibility by reference to the average industrial wage would require services to seek details of parents' earnings whereas the CCSS is based on existing means tested criteria which include receipt of social welfare payment, family income supplement (FIS) or having a GP visit or Medical Card.  Eligibility for the medical and GP visit cards takes account of factors relevant to disadvantage and low income, and is considered a reasonable basis on which to set the upper threshold at which parents qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">As the CCSS is a publicly funded support scheme for community services targeted at low income and disadvantaged parents, it is necessary that it is based on clear and transparent criteria which measure the actual level of service provision as well as the level of disadvantage of the parents availing of the participating service.  A discretionary scheme would not meet these requirements.  The CCSS also assists services in ensuring that they operate on the basis of a sustainable business model based on a fee structure which is appropriate to their actual operating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">It should be noted that funding provided under the previous EOCP scheme amounted to €37 million in 2007.  Funding provided under the CCSS amounted to €52m in 2008, and is expected to increase to €56m in 2009.  The September 2008 service returns indicated that there had been a significant increase in the number of children attending services, not just in the disadvantaged cohort, but also among middle and upper-income families.  As there is no prospect of additional funding being provided to increase the current subvention rates an increase in the Band C subvention rate would require a reduction in either the Band A rate, the Band B rate or a combination of both.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">To co-ordinate the provision of quality child care training a new Workforce Development Plan is being developed by the Early Education Unit in my Office.  This will have a positive impact on the career paths of child care workers and should help retain personnel in the child care sector.  The recent Budget announcement of the introduction of a free pre-school year in early childhood care and education (ECCE) from January next will also help to sustain thousands of jobs in the child care sector.  The scheme will provide a capitation grant of over €2,400 to participating services.</p>

            <p eId="para_2904">As the Deputy may be aware, the finalisation of the latest portfolio of capital grant applications, under the NCIP, was delayed pending the introduction of the recent Supplementary Budget.  Following decisions in the budget the capital allocation now available for 2009/2010 will meet existing capital grant commitments but will not be sufficient to allow for the approval of any additional grant applications.  It is therefore not possible to approve the capital grant application for the group referred to by the Deputy at this time.  My Office will be writing to the group shortly to advise them of this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2905">In relation to the Deputy's query in regard to funding under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), also under the NCIP, I understand that the group in question has been advised that it's funding allocation for 2009 is €20,000 and that Pobal is in the process of making the quarterly payment.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_883">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3070">In preparation for the introduction of the new national standards for residential care settings for Older People, the Health Service Executive has put in place a programme of preparation to ensure that its public facilities will be in a position to comply with the requirements of the standards.  This preparation has focused on two particular areas to ensure that: policies, procedures and overall service are sufficient to meet the new standards; and the overall infrastructure is adequately developed on a phased basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">The Executive established a Residential Standards National Reference Group which included Managers/Directors of Nursing of HSE residential facilities.  Under the auspices of this group, each residential care setting is currently undertaking work to benchmark their facility against the standards in order to identify and address the deficits that can be addressed on a cost neutral basis.  There are also formal implementation groups established across the four areas with the national group acting as a reference group to guide the work of the implementation groups at local level.  The overall effort is to ensure preparation within the public facilities to comply with each of the 32 standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3072">In some cases, additional investment will be required.  In 2006, at the request of my Department, the Executive carried out an assessment of need for residential care for older people in preparation for both the impending standards and the National Development Plan 2009-2013.  As part of this work, an assessment was undertaken to establish the extent to which existing public residential accommodation required replacement or refurbishment in the context of emerging standards, but also in the context of wider environmental and structural requirements including health &amp; safety, fire and other criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3073">In terms of reconfiguration and development the focus of the HSE's programme is to target the highest priority locations in the first instance and progressing over time, within the resources available, to bring all our facilities up to the required standards.  The Deputy will be aware that Standard 25 addresses the physical environment for all types of residential centres.  A distinction is made between new and existing facilities.  This provides a six year period for existing nursing homes, whether public, private or voluntary to meet certain infrastructural deficits, for example with regard to room sizes, the number of residents per room and usable floor space.  The Chief Inspector has discretion to extend this timeframe where the provider and the Chief Inspector agree a written, explicit, costed plan with timescales to address these deficits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3074">The 2009 National Service Plan sets out its plan for the management and configuration of public long-term residential care services in the current year.  The Service Plan identifies a requirement to reduce the number of long-term residential care beds in some parts of the country, particularly where there is a surplus and/or the standard of facilities is considered inadequate, and where it is necessary to address infrastructural deficits in order to meet health &amp; safety and fire requirements, and the new standards.  It also provides for a number of additional and replacement long-term residential care beds over the course of 2009.  The latest information from the HSE indicates that 737 additional beds and 506 replacement beds will become operational during 2009. This includes beds being provided under the Capital Plan and beds being provided under the Fast-Track Initiative.</p>

Under the Health Act 2008, persons aged 70 years and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card should their gross income not exceed €700 per week for a single person or €1,400 per week for a couple.  Determination of an individual's eligibility status is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">Persons with full eligibility are entitled to general practitioner services, prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, child health services, home nursing and a maternity and infant care service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">Other services such as allied health professional services may be available to medical card holders but are not based on a statutory entitlement.  Medical card holders may also be entitled to free transport to school for children who live 3 miles or more from the nearest school, exemption from state examination fees in public second-level schools and financial help with buying school books.  They are also exempt from paying the health levy and the income levy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3124">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</p>
            <p eId="para_3125">The scheme was launched in August 2006 and it was envisaged that the timeframe for the scheme would be 2/3 years. Since the commencement of the scheme approximately 35,000 applications have been received by the Scheme Administrator. To date 33,600 applicants have now either received an offer of repayment or have had their application rejected. As a result, there are in the region of 1,400 claims to be processed and it is anticipated the vast majority of these claims will be processed over the coming weeks. It should be noted that repayments offered cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period for appeal has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator.  In addition, claimants who receive offers must be given the opportunity if they so wish, to appeal the Scheme Administrator's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3126">The Scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle the remaining claims as quickly as possible. However, there are a number of different factors which have affected the length of time it takes to process a claim. A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must each be rectified before they can be processed. Over 13,500 estates who have lodged claims to date did not have a grant of representation, as required by law, and the Scheme Administrator has had to establish probate before the claim can be progressed. All relevant facilities around the country have had to be visited to review and retrieve their records of payment. The format in which this information was stored varied widely between institutions and usually included a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files.</p>
            <p eId="para_3127">In regard to the cost of the scheme, a total of €393.7m has been expended to date on the Health Repayment Scheme and a breakdown of the costs is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_3213">I propose to take Questions Nos. 308, 337 and 347 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3214">An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board), which was established under the Nurses Act, 1985, is the statutory regulatory body for nurses and midwives. The Board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister, 2 of whom are representatives of the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3215">Under the Act the Minister has a range of functions in relation to the Board one of which, Section 17 (1), relates to the officers and servants of the Board "In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there shall be appointed such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Board, as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines."</p>
            <p eId="para_3216">The Act also provides that the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 applies to the Board and its officers and servants as if it were a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3217">In addition to its statutory functions, the Board also administers the Nursing Careers Centre on behalf of the Health Services. For this purpose ongoing funding is provided by the HSE and the amount of this funding in 2007 was €600,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3218">While the bulk of the Board's income is generated by fees paid by nurses and midwives, it is a statutory body whose staff have access to a public service pension scheme. It is thus covered by the recent Government decision that, with effect from the 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts. Therefore, when vacancies arise each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_3231">The number of uncertified sick days taken by officers in my Department in 2007, 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 are 679.45, 522.42 and 139.23 respectively. These figures relate to general service grades (Assistant Secretary to Clerical Officer).</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">Under Circular 25/1978 an officer ". . .may be granted leave for one or two days without medical certificate, within a limit of seven days in the aggregate in any period of twelve months. . . ." Data is therefore not currently collated by my Department in respect of uncertified sick leave above seven days. If an officer exceeds the limit of seven days in any period of twelve months the excess is deducted from either his/her annual leave allowance (above statutory minimum), in the current year or in the following year, or a deduction is made from his/her salary.  The following table shows the number of people who took between one and seven days uncertified sick leave in the calendar twelve months of 2007 and 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3257">Data is also not collated by my Department in respect of the days of the week on which officers take uncertified sick leave. However, the Office of the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General undertook sick leave data analysis across several Government departments in 2008 and I understand that "day of the week" was one of the criteria examined. The findings and recommendations of the C &amp; AG are awaited at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">Officers who are absent on certified sick leave for more than 4-6 weeks, depending on the condition, are routinely referred to the office of the Chief Medical Officer of the Civil Service (CMO) for review and advice.  These referrals are solely based on a duty of care principle and should, in no way, be seen as a sanction or disciplinary action against an officer. In fact, the intervention and guidance of the CMO can often aid an officer's return to work after illness. The Human Resources Unit of my Department does not refer officers to the CMO in relation to uncertified sick leave. Rather, as provided for in Paragraph 12 of Circular 25/1978, a formal notification and reminder of the rules governing uncertified sick leave is sent to any staff member who reaches a total of 5 or more days uncertified sick leave in any "rolling" twelve month period. A copy of this letter is also forwarded to the officer's section head, for appropriate follow-up and management.</p>

            <p eId="para_3282">In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government has decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts. Therefore when vacancies arise, each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly. In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">In order to ensure that essential front-line services provided by nurses and other health care professionals are maintained, the new employment control framework for the health sector provides for the redeployment of staff (and associated salary costs) within and across the hospital and primary, community and continuing care pillars, and from one institution to another to support the development of integrated care delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">The way in which the Government decision will be applied in the health sector is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and I have accordingly referred that part of the Deputy's question to the Executive for attention and direct reply.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3291">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010, under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">Services participating in the CCSS receive annual funding on the basis of the number of qualifying parents recorded as using the service in a particular reference week, generally set in late September of each year.  Services may apply mid-year to have their funding reviewed, where they believe they would benefit from additional funding as a result of having additional numbers of qualifying parents.  In 2009, services have been advised that they should request a review by 26 March and that the reference week will be that ending on 10 April.  Where a review results in an increased level of funding, this will be calculated with effect from 1 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">The objective of both the previous support schemes under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP), and the CCSS, has been to provide funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.   Under the previous scheme, participating services were required to charge tiered fees based on ability to pay, however, many of them did not implement this requirement. Under the CCSS, specific subvention rates have been set with 3 categories of parents benefiting from subvented fee rates and parents who do not qualify for subvention paying the full economic cost of their childcare places(s).  Neither scheme provides for core funding and to do so would be discriminatory vis a vis commercial childcare providers who cannot benefit from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">It should be noted that funding provided under the previous EOCP scheme amounted to €37 million in 2007.  Funding provided under the CCSS amounted to €52m in 2008, and is expected to increase to €56m in 2009.  The September 2008 service returns indicated that there had been a significant increase in the number of children attending services, not just in the disadvantaged cohort, but also among middle and upper-income families. As there is no prospect of additional funding being provided to increase the current subvention rates an increase in the Band C subvention rate would require a reduction in either the Band A rate, the Band B rate or a combination of both.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">To co-ordinate the provision of quality childcare training a new Workforce Development Plan is being developed by the Early Education Unit in my Office.  This will have a positive impact on the career paths of childcare workers and should help retain personnel in the childcare sector. The recent Budget announcement of the introduction of a free pre-school year in early childhood care and education (ECCE) from January next will also help to sustain thousands of jobs in the childcare sector.  The scheme will provide a capitation grant of over €2,400 to participating services.</p>

The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate (currently 5%), based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.

In the case of "longer term" investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures. Any calculation of interest is inclusive of Deposit Interest Retention Tax.</p>

        <b>Deputy Paul Kehoe</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport</b>
         the number of uncertified sick days taken within all sections of his Department for the years 2007 and 2008 and to date in 2009; the number of employees who have taken uncertified sick days in the categories one to ten days and over ten days; the number of uncertified sick days taken Fridays and Mondays; the number of persistent offenders with regard to uncertified sick days who have been sent for an independent doctor's opinion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3543">The number of uncertified sick days taken within all sections of my Department amounted to 637 days in 2007, 513 days in 2008, and 157 days to date in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3544">The maximum number of uncertified sick days allowable per person in any one year is 7. No employee is permitted to take over 7 days uncertified sick leave in any one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3545">496 staff took an average of 1.28 uncertified sick days in 2007, 365 took an average of 1.40 uncertified sick days in 2008 and 110 took an average of 1.43 uncertified sick days to date in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3546">As my Department's management system records sick leave by date rather than by day, it is not possible to furnish the information in respect of Fridays and Mondays within the time available. I will arrange to furnish this information to the Deputy at a later date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3547">No staff members have been referred to the Chief Medical Officer on the basis of their uncertified sick leave. Employees on certified sick leave may be referred to the Chief Medical Officer on an individual basis under the sick leave regulations. If an individual is found to be abusing the sick leave facility, disciplinary action, including withdrawal of the privilege of uncertified sick leave, may be invoked.</p>

        <b>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport</b>
         his plans to ensure that people with a disability have equal access to public transport and taxis in view of the decision in the supplementary budget on 7 April 2009 to cut a programme to improve accessibility for disabled persons to public transport by €5 million; his position on the commitment in the programme for Government 2007 to have 100% wheelchair accessible taxis in all cities by 2010 in view of the fact that wheelchair accessible taxis as a percentage of the overall taxi fleet have dropped from 21% in 2000 to 5% in 2008; his views on whether a commitment to an accessible taxi fleet is imperative to ensure people with a disability can fully participate in society; if he will grant priority to this matter in view of the fact that 26% of accessible taxis are ten years or older; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3991">Policy regarding public transport accessibility is set out in ‘Transport Access for All', my Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005. Measures to implement the Plan are already well advanced. Since the year 2000, all major refurbishment projects at bus and rail stations, together with the construction of new stations and the purchase of trains or buses take account of the needs of people with mobility and sensory impairments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3992">Significant resources for accessibility are being provided under Transport 21 to facilitate further progress. Accessibility is being built into new public transport infrastructure projects and funding is also being provided to continue the phased retrofit of existing infrastructure. While the 2009 allocation for public transport accessibility improvement projects has been reduced from €25m to €20m, the revised allocation represents a 43% increase on the 2008 allocation and provides ample scope for accessibility improvement projects planned for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3993">In addition, funding of €11 million, an increase of 10% on the 2008 provision, is being provided by my Department in 2009 for the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which also provides services to people with disabilities.  In relation to wheelchair accessible taxis, the percentage of the whole taxi fleet that was wheelchair accessible in 2008 was 7.5%.  While this is a reduction from the percentage of the fleet that was wheelchair accessible pre-liberalisation, the number of wheelchair accessible taxis has actually increased, though not at the same rate as the overall expansion of the fleet.  There were 1,600 licensed wheelchair accessible taxis in 2008 — up from 1,246 in 2005.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation has submitted proposals for a subsidy scheme to assist in the purchase of wheelchair accessible taxis and the issue is under consideration in my Department having regard to the commitment in the Programme for Government and in the context of the overall budgetary situation. In the context of the public consultation which the Commission has launched on the basis of the economic review of the taxi sector, it has sought submissions from the public and the taxi industry on the key recommendations of the review, including in relation to measures to secure greater provision of taxi services for people with disabilities and it is undertaking further analysis in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4004">Penalty points have been introduced on a phased basis, beginning in 2002, and since then in 2003, 2004, 2006 and this year (with effect from 1 May).  This process will continue for the remaining offences which are scheduled to become penalty points offences in the Road Traffic Acts</p>
            <p eId="para_4005">In all cases, penalty points are applied to existing offences, and with the aim of improving road safety through driver behaviour, and in the case of the most recent penalty point offences, improving vehicle standards.  For example, the use of a vehicle without a test certificate (where applicable) is already an offence which on conviction carries a fine of up to €2,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_4006">It is now the case, for the 5 offences to which penalty points will be attached with effect from 1 May, that such points will be applied on conviction, in addition to any fine or imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">The increase in inquiries to the National Car Testing Service has created some difficulties in making applications for tests, but these are temporary and  thousands of test appointments have successfully been made in the last few days, including for cars which were due to be tested in 2007 and 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">I have no plans to postpone the commencement date of the 1st of May.  The number of test appointments made by cars due for testing in 2007 and 2008 underlines both the road safety message and the effectiveness of the penalty point system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4009">I am sure the Deputy will continue to support my efforts to introduce all aspects of the Road Safety Strategy including the introduction of Penalty Points.</p>

One of its key recommendations is that an emergency alert system for missing children, similar to the "Amber Alert" in place in other countries, should be established. I welcome this recommendation.

            <p eId="para_4405">The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4406">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  The application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy is in the latter stages of processing. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4412">As the Deputy may be aware, there is a statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland, set out in the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  This Act established two independent refugee status determination offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether in each case, such status should be granted.  These offices are the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_4413">Asylum applications are determined on an individual case basis.  Every asylum applicant is entitled to an investigation and determination of his/her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  They are also entitled to a right of appeal to a statutorily independent office — the Refugee Appeals Tribunal; and access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service.  The UNHCR is given full access to the refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure fair procedures and compliance with Geneva Convention obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4414">In assessing each individual asylum application or appeal, the offices' referred to must, in accordance with their statutory remit, have regard to the specific claims made by the applicant including claims involving female genital mutilation (FGM), as measured against objective, reputable, up-to-date information relating to an applicant's country of origin. Such country of origin information is sourced from a wide variety of areas, including reports prepared by:</p>
            <p eId="para_4415">the UK Home Office and Border Agency;</p>
            <p eId="para_4416">the US State Department;</p>
            <p eId="para_4417">the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board;</p>
            <p eId="para_4418">UNHCR;</p>
            <p eId="para_4419">Amnesty International;</p>
            <p eId="para_4420">Other EU Member States;</p>
            <p eId="para_4421">Media and Internet sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">Reports on relevant issues in the country in question e.g. in respect of FGM in Nigeria, would include reports on human rights issues in Nigeria prepared by the Joint British-Danish fact-finding mission to Abuja and Lagos.</p>
            <p eId="para_4423">These various country of origin reports would reference statistical information produced by both the state authorities and UN Agencies such as UNICEF.</p>
            <p eId="para_4424">When evaluating an application for refugee status where fear of FGM is alleged, the ORAC considers the country and area where the application comes from and whether FGM is legally prohibited.  Other issues considered include the credibility and plausibility of the individual applicant's account of their claim, the likelihood of FGM for that particular person, the State and NGO supports available, and the likely consequences if the asylum application is refused and the applicant is returned to their country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_4425">The Deputy might also like to be aware that when assessing asylum claims, the ORAC avails not only of its own internal research expertise but also of the services of expert researchers in the Refugee Documentation Centre (RDC), an independent library and research service within the Legal Aid Board.  The RDC provides a research and query service on country of origin information for all organisations involved in the asylum process.</p>

            <p eId="para_4975">I understand that the Public Accounts Committee is in the process of examining the procurement arrangements in respect of contracts awarded by the Irish Prison Service to one particular construction company during the period in question, so it would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on that particular case at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4976">The Irish Prison Service has taken several major steps in recent years in order to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved for all expenditure.  In March 2007, a new professionally trained central procurement unit was established within the Irish Prison Service, with the stated purpose of modernising the procurement function and introducing new policies and procedures to ensure that proper controls are exercised over the procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4977">Following consultation with internal stakeholders, the Irish Prison Service Procurement Policy was issued by the Director General in September 2008.  The Irish Prison Service Finance Directorate is engaged in an ongoing promotion and education process in relation to the Procurement Policy and related presentations have been made to staff at all levels within the organisation.  The issue of procurement and, in particular, adherence to the Procurement Policy, is an ongoing item on the agenda for senior management meetings.  During 2008, a number of key staff appointments were made to the Finance Directorate of the Irish Prison Service, including a Director with sole responsibility for Finance and Procurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4978">The Irish Prison Service are committed to ensuring that procurement is carried out in an open and transparent manner with the overriding principle of achieving value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_4980">The granting of Irish Citizenship through Naturalisation is a privilege and an honour and not an entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4981">Processing of applications for a certificate of naturalisation is a two stage process: 1) initial processing and 2) further processing. All applications that pass initial processing commence further processing in strict chronological order. Therefore the only status of relevance to an applicant is whether they have passed initial processing and whether they have commenced further processing. This information is already provided to the applicants by letter and on-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_4982">Applicants are informed by letter, within a week at present, whether their application has passed the initial processing stage. In the same letter, they are informed of the average timeframe from application to decision.  Information on the average time from application to decision and what applications have commenced further processing is provided on the Irish Nationality and Immigration Services website and is also automatically provided on the telephone helpline introductory script to enable callers seeking this information to receive it without having to wait for an operator.</p>
            <p eId="para_4983">If there are any problems with an application that require the input of the applicant, the Citizenship Division contacts the applicant directly.  The vast majority of queries to the Citizenship helpline relate to information, largely similar to that mentioned above, which has already been provided to each applicant by letter, on-line or on the helpline introduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_4984">I am sure the Deputy will be aware that, in an effort to improve its service to Oireachtas Members, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has established a service to provide information/answers to queries in relation to individual immigration and citizenship cases by way of an e-mail address (INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie) which is exclusively for Oireachtas Members (and their authorised staff).  A commitment was given that the majority of e-mails received would be responded to within 10 working days and I am informed that this commitment is being adhered to and, indeed, improved upon.  In its first year of operation more than 4,000 enquiries were responded to within the timeframe.  I would encourage TD's and Senators to make use of the service as it provides information for Oireachtas members in a timely and less costly way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4987">I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 and 424 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4988">While work on finalising the detail of the Revised Estimates Volume is not yet completed, I can say that priority will continue to be given to resources, including overtime, for front-line policing duties.  The focus across all areas of activity will, as always, be on intelligence led operations, high visibility patrolling and utilising our resources to the greatest effect to get the best results.  I am satisfied that any measures which we take to ensure proper control of the public finances will recognise fully the need to preserve front line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4989">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána on 28 February, 2009, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 14,371, with a further 1,043 students in training.  Numbers are scheduled to reach a record high of almost 15,000 by the end of this year.  The number of Community Gardaí on that date was 736.</p>
            <p eId="para_4990">The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda Officers.  This allocation of personnel and other resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_4991">In January the Garda Commissioner and I launched a new National Model of Community Policing for An Garda Síochána.  The concept of community policing is central to the Force's ability to deliver a professional, effective and responsive policing service.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, operated by Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, has proved to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are funded by the Youth Justice Service and are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the Diversion Programme.  There are currently 100 of these projects operating in various locations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4992">The primary focus is on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the current services provided, and in this regard the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Garda Síochána are reviewing the effectiveness of the diversionary measures in use by the projects, so as to make best use of the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_5016">Business Permission was renewed on 5 March 2008 for a further 12 months in which the person concerned was advised that the conditions set in the original notice of approval still applied and that evidence was to be produced at the next renewal date that the business had been fully operational.</p>
            <p eId="para_5017">A request was received from the person concerned on 26 January 2009 to renew his business permission which contained no set of accounts.

            <p eId="para_5018">The renewal of the business permission was refused on 26 March 2009. Documentation submitted in support of the renewal did not satisfy INIS that the business was operating successfully based on the extremely low level of income being generated or was adding to the commercial activity and competitiveness of the State.  An appeal of this refusal to renew business permission was received by INIS on 07 April 2009.  The appeal was considered and a decision was conveyed to the person concerned in writing which issued to current and previous addresses on 16 April 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5052">The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  Applicants must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5053">The Act further provides that the court may require an applicant to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.

Work on preparing the strategy is well advanced.  There was a good response to a call for submissions in the middle of last year and a round of regional consultations with Non-Government Organisations took place at the end of 2008. The details of the Strategy are currently being progressed with the help of Cosc's State and NGO partners. Cosc has also commenced a research project to map the relevant services currently available in Ireland for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and this work will also inform the strategy.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5066">Arrangements are being made to have all sex offenders in prison assessed before their release.  This is being introduced on a phased basis giving priority to those offenders identified as being of higher risk.  I have been advised that by the end of this year, we will have reached the stage where the majority of sex offenders are being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5067">While all sex offenders must notify the Gardaí of their names and addresses, generally speaking  when a prisoner has fully completed his or her  sentence he/she is no longer subject to any legal obligation to be subject to supervision.  However, some former prisoners will, of their own volition, participate in courses/programmes arranged through the Probation Service. In the case of sexual offences the Judge at the time of sentencing may include a post release supervision order which applies after the custodial part of the sentence has been served.  Some form of supervision may also be imposed by the Courts in the context of a part or full suspended sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5068">The Probation Service carries out formal risk assessments on offenders using validated risk assessment instruments. This informs both the level of supervision and the targets for intervention during supervision. Evidence from research indicates that the higher the level of risk, the greater the level of intervention required. Supervision levels therefore vary depending on the level of assessed risk. Supervision incorporates a multi agency and cross sectoral approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_5069">Additionally my Department through the Probation Service financially supports a broad range of community programmes to support the supervision process. For example, in partnership with the Granada Institute, the Probation Service runs the Lighthouse Sex Offender Treatment Programme. This is a therapeutic group work programme which aims to reduce the risk of re-offending. There are two group work programmes running currently in Dublin and one in Cork. The three programmes offer places to a total on 24 sex offenders at any one time.  I should also make the Deputy aware of some more recent developments:</p>
            <p eId="para_5070">Firstly, I published a significant Discussion Document on the management of sex offenders last January which sets out a range of enhanced initiatives that will result in more strategic targeting of higher risk offenders by the Gardaí and the Probation Service with the full support of the Irish Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5071">Secondly, I have asked my Department to review the operation of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_5072">Thirdly, I have also asked my Department to examine how we might use Electronic Monitoring technology to monitor sex offenders during the first six months following release from prison as well as the more general application of this technology to the wider prisoner population. The Project Group set up to look at this matter — which is led by the Probation Service —  is due to report later in the year and my Department is looking at the legislative implications of monitoring the sex offender cohort for a defined period following release.</p>
            <p eId="para_5073">The Irish Prison Service is introducing a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the range and availability of therapeutic interventions for sex offenders in prison, increasing participation rates and increasing the effectiveness of interventions. The new treatment programme "Building Better Lives", the rollout of which commenced in January 2009, will ensure that all sex offenders serving sentences of one year or more will have access to appropriate treatment.</p>

It would not be feasible to consolidate those laws until they are brought fully up to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_5077">The Deputy's Question is understood to refer to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime.  Many of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime have already been given effect through legislation.  Additional legislation is required before ratification of the Convention can take place.  This legislation is currently being drafted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5078">The enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into effect on 7 June 2008 brought Ireland into compliance with the criminal law/law enforcement elements of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Other aspects of the Protocol are being dealt with administratively in the context of the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland — which is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be published later this year — and through engagement with the Governmental and non-governmental organisations in this area.  This Plan sets out structures which, when in place, will bring Ireland into line with its international obligations by providing the baseline structures for the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings and the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.</p>

            <p eId="para_5097">The cost per prisoner is based on the overall operating costs in each year, i.e, the actual running costs, such as pay, light and heat, food, maintenance, small works, etc., and also includes certain fixed costs that arise irrespective of the number of prisoners in custody, e.g. staffing numbers, utilities, etc.  In addition, all headquarters and central service costs are allocated over the prison establishments for the purpose of calculating the cost per prisoner at each location.  Major capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation in the interest of facilitating comparison between individual institution costs.  In addition, a Segregation Unit was opened in Cloverhill Prison in May 2007. The average cost per prisoner in Cloverhill Prison for 2007 was €84,700.  The increase in the annual cost per prisoner during the period 2004 to 2007 is due primarily to pay increases under the National Pay Agreements.</p>

        <b>Deputy Charles Flanagan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the penalties under the Public Order Act for alcohol related disorder; and his plans to increase this penalty. 
        [15481/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1001">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5100">Most public order offences involving alcohol related disorder are prosecuted under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Sections 4 and 5 of that Act are of particular relevance to alcohol related offences. They relate to offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">The Deputy will be aware that the fines for sections 4 and 5 offences were increased last year by an amendment to the 1994 Act in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The maximum fine for persons convicted of an offence under section 4 is now €500 and the maximum fine for a conviction under section 5 is now €1000.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to Section 8 of the 1994 Act.  That section provides for a Garda to direct a person to desist from behaving in a manner contrary to the provisions of section 4 and 5.  The Garda may instruct the person to leave the vicinity of the area in question.  Failure to comply with the direction is an offence punishable by a fine or up to six months imprisonment, or both.  The maximum fine was increased to €1000 by the 2008 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5102">The Deputy will be aware that section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides for exclusion orders.  Certain restrictions can be imposed by these orders.  The 2008 Act presented an opportunity to further enhance Garda powers to combat alcohol related disorder with the insertion of a new section 8A into the 1994 Act.  Section 8A provides that a Garda may confiscate intoxicating liquor from a person and may direct that person and any accompanying persons to leave the area in a peaceable manner.  A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable to a fine of up to €1000.</p>
            <p eId="para_5103">I would also inform the Deputy that in September 2008, I introduced Regulations that provide for the issue of fixed charge notices for offences under sections 4 and 5 of the 1994 Act.  These Regulations permit a Garda to serve a fixed charge notice on a person who, in the opinion of the Garda, has committed one of these offences.  The notice provides for the option of paying a fixed charge of €140 in respect of disorderly conduct and €100 in respect of public intoxication, instead of being prosecuted for the relevant offence. These Regulations gave effect to sections 23A and 23B of the 1994 Act which were inserted by Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  I have no plans at present for further changes in the level of penalties but I will be keeping the situation under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5105">The Deputy will be aware that there are, of course, legislative provisions already in place to oblige people to stay away from other people or places.  Thus, the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 permits the Court, in appropriate cases, to order a person not to communicate with a specified person or not to approach within a specified distance his/her home.  The Criminal Justice Act 2007 empowers the Court, following the conviction of a person for a serious offence, to make a ‘protection of persons' order.  The purpose of the order is to protect the victim of the offence or any other person named in the order, who might be a relative of the victim or a witness, from harassment or intimidation by the offender.  Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to threaten or intimidate a witness or potential witness or members of his/her family with the intention to pervert the course of justice, and I have indicated my intention to increase the already lengthy penalties provided for in this regard.  I am examining, in the context of the Programme for Government commitments, what further steps may be necessary in relation to ‘stay away' orders.</p>

            <p eId="para_5113">The Community-based CCTV Scheme was launched in 2005 to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with establishing a community CCTV system.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  Two types of grant have been made available under the scheme.  Substantive grants of up to €100,000 have been made available from my Department with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs providing matching funding for successful applications from RAPID areas.  Pre-development grants of up to €5,000 have also been made available to assist local communities to develop substantive proposals in their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5114">Two major rounds of the scheme were advertised in 2005/2006 and 2007 with a total of 13 and 30 substantive schemes respectively approved for funding.  A further 2 schemes under the Limerick Regeneration programme were approved in 2008.  In addition, 54 schemes were awarded pre-development grants over the same period.  The annual financial allocation for CCTV includes both the Community and Garda schemes and is not recorded separately.  Expenditure on the Community schemes is dependent on progress on implementation by the various communities with staged payments made as appropriate.  Accordingly, the funding allocation per annum requested by the Deputy is not readily available and in any event, would not be meaningful, as the award of funds is directly linked to the dates the various rounds of the schemes were announced.</p>
            <p eId="para_5115">However, expenditure (on both substantive and pre-development grants) by my Department for each of the years since grants have been approved is set-out in the table below.  To date, a total of 20 substantive schemes have been installed and are operational with the remaining 25 schemes at various stages of implementation.  Many of these are at an advanced stage with part payments already made.</p>

         the initiatives in place within An Garda Síochána for tackling racism, homophobia, and upholding the human rights standards within society here. 
        [15489/09]

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1008">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5165">Within the Garda Síochána there have been a number of developments designed to bring regard for human rights to the core of policing in Ireland.  Section 7 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 sets out the functions of the Garda Síochána to include (a) the protection of life and property and (b) vindicating the human rights of each individual.  Section 16 of the Act of 2005 provides a revised form of declaration for persons joining the Force, which specifically directs each new member's attention to the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties.  In addition a 32 page guide to the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 has been distributed to each member of the force.  The guide outlines the key principles of human rights obligations as they apply to operational policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_5166">Human rights compliance also features strongly in the Garda Síochána's corporate strategy "A Time for Change (2007-2009)". That document commits the Gardaí to engaging in "a culture of public service grounded in honesty, integrity, respect, professionalism and accountability". It further commits to "compliance with the highest standards of ethical human rights and service standards."</p>
            <p eId="para_5167">The Garda Síochána has a comprehensive education, training and information system for the professional development of all members.  This development programme incorporates human rights training.  This applies both to Garda students and at supervisory and managerial development courses.  In addition the preparation of a new statutory Code of Ethics is well underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">The ongoing need to "human rights proof" Garda policies has been fully accepted by Garda management.  In this regard the publication of the Irish Human Rights Commission policy statement on the Human Rights Compliance of An Garda Síochána on Monday last and the recommendations they have made will be considered carefully by my Department and the Garda Commissioner so that the matter is the subject of ongoing improvement and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5169">At an operational level I understand that there are a number of practical initiatives underway involving the Garda Síochána and disparate groups within society to ensure that every effort is made to uphold individual human rights and tackle racist and homophobic incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_5170">These initiatives include:</p>
            <p eId="para_5171">ongoing liaison between An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Minister for Integration in relation to the integration of migrants and in relation to monitoring of incidents of racism.</p>
            <p eId="para_5172">extension of the remit of the Garda and Racial Intercultural Office (GIRO), which has  responsibility for co-ordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity, to also include groups representing the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) communities and organisations representing persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5173">the training of over 600 Ethnic Liaison Officers to link with members of ethnic minority communities and the traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_5174">the adaptation of the PULSE system to record incidents of a racist nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_5175">the active interaction with members of ethnic minority communities as part of the Garda Síochána's commitment under the National Action Plan against Racism.</p>
            <p eId="para_5176">close liaison with the Gay and Lesbian Network (GLEN) to develop jointly a guide to best practice on policing and the LGBT communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5177">the development  of plans to have a trained LGBT officer in each Garda Division</p>

            <p eId="para_5180">I wish to advise the Deputy that the gathering of all the detailed information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5181">The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prison, which was launched in May 2006.  Working to fulfil the commitments contained in the Policy and Strategy involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5182">At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids on committal are offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options which may include stabilization on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Methadone maintenance is available in 8 of the 14 places of detention (accommodating over 80% of the prison population).  The table below provides the number of prisoners who received opiate substitution treatment with methadone (detox, stabilisation or maintenance) since 2003.</p>

The evidence would indicate that a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to effectively care for this group and that maintenance of a personalised therapeutic relationship yields the best outcomes.  With this in mind, specialist addiction nursing posts were developed in the Irish Prison Service with a view to streamlining care and throughcare back into the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_5255">The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has 9 spaces specifically allocated for a therapeutic drug free programme.  This intensive programme is 6 weeks in duration and includes involvement from both prison based staff and external community agencies.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving a drug free status.</p>
            <p eId="para_5256">There is no specific limit on the number of detox treatments available in each prison, the number of detoxifications carried out will be determined by the clinical needs of the prisoners presenting.  The duration of the detoxification process varies from institution to institution but is typically of 16 or 21 days duration.  For example in 2008, there were 727 treatment episodes of detoxification using methadone.</p>
            <p eId="para_5257">Prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and work and training options which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.  Because of this multifaceted approach, it is not possible to give comprehensive detail on the total number of prisoners engaged in the various treatment modalities.  However there were 2487 treatment episodes using methadone substitution in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5258">Staffing costs represent the bulk of drug treatment funding and it is not possible to apportion the actual time spent by healthcare and prison officer staff on the treatment related duties which form part of the overall role they perform.  However, expenditure on drug treatment, excluding indirect staff and ancillary costs was approximately €2.5 million in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_5260">As the Deputy will be aware, a report of the Law Reform Commission on prosecution appeals and pre-trial hearings cited the lack of sentencing information and a shared sentencing framework in the District Court as difficulties with regard to providing the DPP with a power to seek a review of unduly lenient sentences handed down in that court.  Work is progressing on addressing this deficit through the development of the project known as the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS).  This project is being overseen by a steering committee, established by the Courts Service Board and chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court.  The objective is to develop a system will allow users to enter relevant criteria and access information about the range of sentences and other penalties which have been imposed for particular types of offence.  This will be an invaluable support to judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.  When implemented, I expect that this initiative will facilitate the preparation of legislation to provide the DPP with a power to seek a review of unduly lenient sentences handed down in the District Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_5261">Improved access to sentencing precedents and practice via the ISIS project would also facilitate any initiative on providing for prosecution submissions on sentences.  At present there is no statute regulating the right of the prosecution to make such submissions, however, the DPP's Guidelines for Prosecutors give some direction in this regard, as do the codes of conduct of the Bar and the Law Society.  The Balance in the Criminal Law Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, considered this issue and recommended that the DPP's guidelines be amended to permit the prosecution to assist the sentencing judge by volunteering information on sentencing precedents irrespective of whether such detail was or was not solicited by the Court.  The Group further recommended that my Department, together with the Office of the DPP, keep under review the possibility of allowing the prosecutor to volunteer precedents and to make submissions at the outset of the sentencing stage and to make submissions to the court as to the aggravating factors, but without recommending a particular sentence range.  These recommendations are being examined by my Department.</p>

The aim of the Institute is to facilitate the continuing education of judges in relation to all aspects of the judicial function.  The Institute operates on a non-statutory basis at present.  I am providing, in the context of my proposals for the Judicial Council Bill referred to in the Government Legislation Programme, for establishment of the Institute on a statutory basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_5281">I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 433 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5282">The Deputy will be aware that the issues relating to admissibility and advance disclosure by the defence were examined by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, which reported in March 2007 to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_5283">The question of the admissibility of certain evidence relates to determining what evidence can be presented on a basis agreed between the parties and the court.  Maximising the possibilities for agreement on as much of the evidence as possible and at the earliest possible stage would clearly be of benefit not only in so far as it would reduce the trial time and the related costs, it would also, in many cases, reduce the difficulties a trial can evoke for the victim.  It is therefore, without doubt, a worthwhile objective. Having considered the matter, the Review Group recommended that legislation be introduced to provide that admissibility issues should be determined prior to the swearing in of a jury.  Its recommendation is being considered by my Department.  I am also awaiting the outcome of the Law Reform Commission's review of the law of evidence, as part of its Third Programme of Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_5284">In relation to advance disclosure by the defence, it is recognised that a considerable disparity exists between the obligations of the defence side when compared to those faced by the prosecution.  As a general rule, the prosecution must set out precisely the case it will be seeking to present and the conclusions which it will attempt to prove.  Apart from certain limited exceptions, the defence is not required to furnish any information.  The exceptions to the rule relate to alibi evidence under Section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, witness information required under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and evidence regarding the mental state of the accused under Section 19 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5285">The Review Group considered a range of options that would have extended the areas where advance disclosure by the defence would be required.  It concluded that any extension of the present obligations should be limited to expert and technical reports and witness statements of experts which the defence intends to present as evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5286">It is my intention to give effect to this conclusion in the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009.  The Bill was approved for drafting by the Government at the end of 2008.  I expect to publish the Bill in this term.  Meanwhile, a copy of the general scheme of the Bill is available from my Department's webpage.</p>

            <p eId="para_5289">I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 432 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5290">In general, courts have discretion, subject to the requirements of the administration of justice, as to the directions they may give in a particular case to enable a trial to be conducted expeditiously, including directions for exchange of documents.  Moreover, case management regimes, for example, have been in operation in the High Court in the areas of commercial proceedings, family law proceedings and some other categories of litigation.  I understand that, borrowing on the experience of those regimes, proposals to introduce case progression procedures in respect of further litigation categories in the High Court are currently being studied by the judiciary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5291">Last September I signed into law the Circuit Court Rules (Case Progression in Family Law Proceedings) 2008 which conferred County Registrars with important powers to assist in expediting family law proceedings in the Circuit Court.  Those rules assign to County Registrars, through case progression hearings, the functions of overseeing preparation of family law cases, setting timetables for completion of pre-trial steps, generally monitoring the progress of the case, and making final arrangements for the trial.</p>
            <p eId="para_5292">The Third Programme of work of the Law Reform Commission includes a project on documentary evidence and technology.  Documentary evidence is an essential element of nearly all litigation.  This project will discuss the rules concerning proof of execution and authentication of documents, and consider the need for their modernisation.  The project will also consider whether electronic evidence should be regulated as a separate category of evidence.  My Department will give careful consideration to the findings of the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5293">The amount of time potentially spent by Gardaí in court proceedings was noted in a recent report of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate.  It also noted that within the Dublin Metropolitan Region a Court Presenter system is in place in the Dublin Metropolitan Court District and that outside the DMR the local District Officer is the Prosecuting Officer, representing the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the majority of prosecutions before the District and Circuit Courts.  The Inspectorate welcomed developments in the Court Presenter system which frees up significant Garda time from court duty.  The Inspectorate has suggested that this scheme should be extended to all courts throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region and I understand this recommendation is under consideration by the Garda authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5300">The Strengthening Families Programme (SFP) is an internationally recognized parenting and family strengthening programme for high risk families first developed in the US in the 1980s. It is an evidence based family skills training programme  which was found to significantly reduce problem behaviour, delinquency, and alcohol and drug abuse in children and to improve social competencies and school  behaviour.  Positive results from empirical research of this Programme over 15 years in the US and other countries indicate that the programme is robust and effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_5301">The Programme was first implemented in Ireland in Cork in 2006/2007 through the Southern Regional Drugs Task Force.  The initiative was made possible through the cooperation of a number of agencies including the Probation Service. Of the first 10 families which started that programme, 9 graduated, indicating the Programme's ability to retain clients.  Since then the Programme has been delivered and resourced by a number of different agencies including the Probation Service, Drug Task Forces, the HSE and the National Juvenile Office of An Garda Síochána.  As such, no one Department has overall responsibility and coordination for the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5302">Under my Department, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) directly funds the delivery the Programme through the Young Person's Probation Service (YPP).  YPP personnel facilitate training of staff in the programme including Probation funded project staff, juvenile Liaison Officers and Regional Drug Task Force workers.  YPP also supports referral and co-facilitation.  YPP, in conjunction with Le Chéile, a YPP project has recently commenced the development of a nationwide Strengthening Families Programme.  Le Chéile has been provided with €256,324 by the IYJS in grant funding for 2009 in this regard.  Programmes are now being run in Cork and Galway and are also planned for Dublin (Ballymun, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Finglas), Dundalk, Portlaoise, Limerick and Waterford.  At the end of the year it is anticipated that  Le Chéile will have delivered the Programme to 120 families.  Further information related to the detail of the Programme is available on the IYJS website at www.iyjs.ie and also at http://www.strengtheningfamiliesprogram.org.</p>

            <p eId="para_5328">At the outset I would propose to set out the background to and the context for the introduction of Section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  In terms of the legislation introduced by the Government to tackle serious drug trafficking, Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Acts 1999, 2006 and 2007), provides for mandatory minimum sentences of not less than 10 years imprisonment for individuals convicted of a first offence under sections 15A and/or 15B of that Act.  The mandatory minimum sentence, or to give it its more accurate description, presumptive minimum sentence, is to be imposed in all cases save for those with very specific and exceptional mitigating factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5329">Where an individual is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under sections 15A and/or 15B a court must always impose a sentence of not less than the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.  The maximum sentence available for section 15A and 15B offences is life imprisonment.  Having regard to concern about the degree to which the presumptive minimum sentence was being imposed, notwithstanding the amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 further amended section 27 of the 1977 Act  in order to insert an interpretation clause.</p>
            <p eId="para_5330">The clause emphasises that a decision to depart from the presumptive minimum sentence must be based on the presence of exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence or the offender which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose such a sentence.  Referring to the damaging effects of drug related crime on society the clause states that a court must, as a general principle, always impose the presumptive minimum sentence on persons convicted of an offence under sections 15A and 15B.</p>
            <p eId="para_5331">The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to conduct a formal annual review of the effect of these provisions concerning the mandatory sentence regime for drug crime which were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  As the provisions in question which are contained in Section 33 of the Act have only been in operation since 18 May 2007, the issue of establishing a formal review mechanism needed to be addressed at an appropriate stage whereby conclusions as to the impact of both the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 which deal with this matter can be appropriately reached.  I believe that the stage has now been reached when the matter can appropriately be reviewed and I have directed that arrangements be made accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5333">The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prison, which was launched in May 2006, continues to be implemented.  The aim of the Strategy is to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">I am glad to tell the Deputy that the Government has provided significant resources to the IPS in recent years to enable it to tackle a range of addiction issues in the prison system.  One example has been the awarding of a contract for the provision of addiction counselling services to Merchants Quay Ireland.  This contract has been rolled out, and addiction counselling services are now available in prisons and places of detention where prisoners require such a service.  The addiction counselling service delivers approximately 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">Furthermore, the implementation of the Policy and Strategy has also seen an intensification of efforts to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons including:</p>
            <p eId="para_5336">Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5337">New visiting arrangements in most closed prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5338">Greater use of screened visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5339">Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_5340">Increased random searching of cells and their occupants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5341">Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5342">Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5343">A number of BOSS chairs are in use which are used to scan all prisoners for contraband secreted in their body cavities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5344">Installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5345">Use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_5346">In addition, a number of new additional security initiatives have been introduced in all closed prisons.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_5347">The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5348">The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_5349">The establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.</p>

         the annual rehabilitation goals and targets set within the prison service; and the level of resourcing it received annually since 2005 to date in 2009.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1021">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5351">A wide range of services of a general and more specialist nature are provided within the prison system to assist in prisoner rehabilitation.  Chief amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  As the Deputy will appreciate these services are important in helping to address offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development and preparation for re-integration back to the community on completion of the prison sentence.  For example, we now have over 90 workshops operating across the prisons capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.</p>
            <p eId="para_5352">Education is an important dimension within the prison setting and a range of education opportunities are available at all institutions.  These are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  The Department of Education and Science provide an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs (220 in the academic year 2008/09).  This enables education to be offered in all prisons including provision for the summer months and also special teaching arrangements where prisoners are segregated.</p>
            <p eId="para_5353">I am glad to tell the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service is also engaged in rolling out an enhanced model of sentence management for prisoners (Integrated Sentence Management — ISM).  ISM will involve a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with a broad range of services in the prisons.  This will lead to a more "prisoner-centred approach" to how the various services available within the prison setting can interact with individual prisoners through provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.  The development and roll-out of this model is planned to take place on a phased basis with the new system currently being piloted in two Dublin prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5354">Furthermore, the Probation Service of my Department also has an important role to play during the course of the prisoner's sentence and providing support to help with re-integration back to the community.  This work ranges from helping prisoners to maintain links with family and community agencies, to encouraging them to address their offending behaviour through individual and group counselling programmes and preparation for release on completion of the sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5355">The gross expenditure figures for the Irish Prison Service as set out in the Appropriation Accounts for the years 2005-2008, are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_5356">2005:        €388.226M</p>
            <p eId="para_5357">2006:        €410.311M</p>
            <p eId="para_5358">2007:        €394.550M</p>
            <p eId="para_5359">2008:        €404.375M  (Provisional)</p>
            <p eId="para_5360">The 2008 figure is provisional, pending audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Due to the multifaceted nature of rehabilitation it is not possible to disaggregate the elements of expenditure by the Irish Prison Service that relate solely to rehabilitation.  As the 2009 revised estimates have not yet been published I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the 2009 funding for the Irish Prison Service at this time.</p>

The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has 9 spaces specifically allocated for a therapeutic drug free programme.  This intensive programme is 6 weeks in duration and includes involvement from both prison based staff and external community agencies.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving drug free status.  There is no specific limit on the number of such treatments available in each prison; the number of detoxifications carried out will be determined by the clinical needs of the prisoners presenting.</p>

            <p eId="para_5364">I wish to advise the Deputy that the Prison Rules, 2007 allow for the discretionary granting of additional remission, up to one third as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, where a prisoner has shown further good conduct through his engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community. That said I wish to advise the House that this additional concession will only be awarded in exceptional cases where I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the prisoner concerned has demonstrated that she/he meets the requirements as set out in Rule 59 of the Prison Rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_5365">In addition, the Programme for Government sets out a range of commitments in relation to penal policy, including targets for fully resourced and staffed rehabilitation programmes to be available for the entirety of the prison population by 2012 and the linking of remission with rehabilitation.  My Department continues to examine how best to implement the commitments in the Programme for Government having regard to the range of rehabilitative programmes currently available, financial and other legal considerations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5395">I am at present preparing a Sexual Offences Bill for which I expect to seek Government approval later this year. Following a review of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, which has now been in operation for more than 7 years, I will be proposing extensive changes to that Act, including the operation of the notification procedures or sex offenders register, as it is more usually called.</p>
            <p eId="para_5396">At present in this jurisdiction a person convicted of a sex offence has 7 days to notify the Garda Síochána of his or her name and address.  The same period of 7 days also currently applies to sex offenders on entering the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5397">The notification period for sex offenders convicted in our neighbouring jurisdictions has been reduced from 14 to 3 days. Unlike Ireland, they have no automatic notification for sex offenders convicted elsewhere.  Part of the strategy for reviewing the notification procedures is to ensure that our laws in that respect approximate as closely as possible with those in the neighbouring jurisdictions. A 3 day notification period in this jurisdiction would ensure a harmonisation of our laws in that respect and should ensure that none of our jurisdictions becomes a safe haven for convicted sex offenders. In the preparation of the 2001 Act, my Department received legal advice that the notification period for sex offenders convicted in Ireland could not be different for convicted sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5440">I should first explain that, under Department of Finance rules, sick leave without medical certification may only be granted to civil servants for one or two-day absences in total and subject to not exceeding seven days in any twelve month period.  If the number of days absence without medical certificate in any period of twelve months, reckoning backwards from the date of the latest absence, exceeds seven in the aggregate, the staff member will have annual leave or pay reduced accordingly.  In no circumstances therefore is an individual permitted to have more than seven absences classified as uncertified sick leave in a twelve month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5441">Uncertified (and certified) leave absences are recorded on the Department's Human Resources Management System which facilitates monitoring of such absences against sick leave limits and appropriate follow-up action such as warnings and disciplinary measures.  While uncertified sick leave absences do not, by their nature, require medical certification, the reason for the absence is required to be given.</p>
            <p eId="para_5442">The identification of uncertified sick leave availed of on Mondays or Fridays is not possible in the time available.  It should be further noted that an absence involving a Friday and the following Monday cannot be regarded as uncertified sick leave as the absence is counted as four days and must therefore be medically certified.</p>
            <p eId="para_5443">Individual instances of sick leave (uncertified or certified) are in certain situations referred to the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service, who is independent in the implementation of his functions.  Repeated short term absences, particularly those of an uncertified nature, would usually be dealt with through internal management procedures in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5444">A breakdown of the number of actual uncertified sick leave days taken in the years 2007, 2008 and up to 20 April 2009 is set out in the following table, along with the average number of uncertified sick leave days taken per employee.</p>

            <p eId="para_5480">I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the conceptual, study and design stages of the Thornton Hall project involved an extensive process of consultation as well as consideration of prison developments in other jurisdictions.

            <p eId="para_5481">It should be noted that Lord Carter in his December 2007 report ‘Securing the Future: Proposals for the Efficient and Sustainable use of Custody in England and Wales' recommended that the way forward is the large prison complex and his recommendation is for a model broadly similar to that envisaged in the design of Thornton Hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_5482">The Thornton Hall prison development will not operate as a single large prison, but rather a campus development containing eight individual, practically self-contained facilities, each with its own unique and discrete regime which will give access to work training, education, rehabilitative programmes and recreation activities appropriate to that population.  The main accommodation units in the Thornton Hall Prison development will encompass a range of accommodation styles and designs.  The main accommodation blocks will contain 192 cells over four wings with two landings per wing.  This range of accommodation style and design will allow for appropriate separation of prisoners in smaller units.</p>

These referrals were made in respect of persons who had been identified as a suspected victims of human trafficking, that is, there were reasonable grounds by a member of An Garda Síochána, not below the rank of a Superintendent, for believing that the person was a victim of an offence under sections 2 or 4 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_5488">The Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking state that a person identified by a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Superintendent, in the Garda National Immigration Bureau, as a suspected victim of human trafficking shall be granted a permission to remain lawfully in the State for period of 60 days ( a ‘recovery and reflection period').</p>
            <p eId="para_5489">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking come to their attention in a number of ways. These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5490">(i) in circumstances where they are identified by members of the Garda Síochána in the course of investigations;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5491">(ii) on referral to the Garda Síochána by the Health Service Executive, or other agencies and NGOs, or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5492">(iii) persons may, as part of their claim for asylum, indicate to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that they have been the victim of human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_5493">In determining if a person is a suspected victim of human trafficking the Garda Síochána takes account of all information that is available to them at the time the case is being considered. This information will vary, considerably, from case to case. The Garda Síochána encourages all relevant agencies to provide all information, whether this supports a claim or otherwise, within their possession to allow the Garda Síochána make an informed and timely decision on each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5494">The State and the Garda Síochána is committed to ensuring that no person who is potentially a victim of human trafficking will be removed from the State while the investigation into the circumstances of the person's arrival into the State, including the identification of the person as a victim, is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_5495">The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings sets out measures to protect and promote the rights of victims, including the identification of victims. The Garda Síochána takes these measures into account in every instance. They do not require absolute certainty for not removing a person from the State. If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting a person to be a victim of human trafficking then the person is recommended for permission to remain lawfully in the State for 60 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_5496">The Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings acknowledges that the identification process takes time and often necessitates detailed enquiries, involving the exchange of information with other countries, parties or organisations which may prolong the identification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5497">The International Organisation on Migration — an international inter-governmental organisation — acknowledges that the screening process to determine if a person is a victim of trafficking consists of two stages. The first is an assessment of the varying indicators that can be evaluated before an interview can take place, followed by a detailed interview with the individual. At the same time, the matter is subject of an investigation by the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_5498">The types of indicators utilised by the Garda Síochána in making a determination include the following: was the person deceived about the nature of the work they would be doing, or where they would be working; were the person's documents confiscated; is there debt bondage; is there a threat of violence. Some other types of indicators utilised include: the type of deception used; the person's illegal status; has the person been forced to lie to friends, or the authorities; and is the person dependent on the individuals who have exploited him / her.</p>
            <p eId="para_5499">To enable the Garda Síochána to establish if any of the indicators outlined, or others, are present it is necessary for the person be interviewed by a member of the Garda Síochána. The purpose of the interview is to elicit as much information as is possible from the person and assess the veracity, or otherwise, of the account being provided. The outcome of this interview will assist the Garda Superintendent in being satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is a suspected victim of human trafficking. Ultimately, in order to make a decision and to progress any investigation into such allegations of a criminal offence, possibly contrary to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008, the Garda Síochána will seek to document the allegations in a statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5500">While ‘reasonable grounds' are not the same as evidence, in the context of contemplation of any criminal offence, to arrive at a state of mind that a person is a suspected victim of human trafficking the Garda Superintendent must be in possession of sufficient information to afford reasonable grounds for that belief. The test of reasonable is whether or not a reasonable person, acting without passion or prejudice, believes what he / she is being told.</p>
            <p eId="para_5501">In every instance all information that is available at that time to the Garda Síochána is considered by the Detective Superintendent, Garda National Immigration Bureau, in conjunction with other senior officers and members of the Garda Síochána directly involved in the individual investigation. Where there is insufficient information for the Detective Superintendent to have reasonable grounds for believing that a person is a victim of suspected trafficking the case remains open and every effort is made to gather additional information from the potential victim or other sources.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5518">As the Deputy will be aware the Government is committed to the introduction of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill in the current Dáil term.  This Bill, which will establish the Property Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis, sets out the main functions of the new Authority which include: establishing and administering a comprehensive licensing system covering all providers of property services, (i.e. Auctioneers, Estate Agents, Letting Agents and Property Management Agents — collectively known as Property Services Providers).  This extended system will replace the current licensing system for Auctioneers and House Agents under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973; setting and enforcing standards for the grant of licences (e.g. educational/training standards; levels of professional indemnity insurance) as well as standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees; establishing and administering a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services, including the imposition of sanctions as appropriate; conducting audits and inspections of Property Services Providers as part of a general compliance and enforcement function; developing and enforcing Codes of Practice; promoting increased consumer protection and public awareness (where appropriate in liaison and cooperation with other statutory bodies and relevant professional and consumer bodies) of property services in general and the cost to consumers, risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services; producing guidance material for the industry and the public; establishing, maintaining and administering a Compensation Fund to compensate parties who lose money as a direct consequence of the dishonesty of a licensee; enforcing licensees obligations under the legislation through general investigations, inspections and court prosecutions; liaison and cooperation with overseas Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519">Pending enactment of the legislation, an Implementation Group has been established to assist and advise on practical matters relating to the establishment of the new Authority and a Chief Executive designate has been appointed and is working closely with the Implementation Group in making arrangements for the establishment of the Authority and its structures including the basic organisational structures, systems, procedures, protocols, rules and regulations, which are fundamental to the long term functioning of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">The new Authority will be unique internationally in the scope of its remit, responsibilities and powers.  It is important therefore that its structures, systems, procedures and rules and regulations be based on solid foundations.  To this end the Implementation Group has: successfully completed the necessary arrangements for the acquisition and fitting out of accommodation for the Authority in Navan, Co. Meath; drawn up a Code of Practice for Auctioneers and Estate Agents, which identifies the key principles and values that should guide the day to day practice of service providers.  The Code incorporates a complaints system which will enable complaints concerning non-compliance with the Code to be investigated; established and published a National Public Register of all licensed Auctioneers and House Agents.  This register will be added to on an ongoing basis and will, once the new legislation is in place, include Management Agents; developed and put in place financial and accounting systems for the Authority; designed and developed a website as part of the education and awareness function; designed and developed computerised licensing and complaints databases suitable for the Authority's long term requirements; developed and implemented an office, file management and data management system for the Authority; developed the systems, procedures rules and regulations necessary for the establishment of a Compensation Fund, including prescribing the manner of reporting of losses sustained by clients and the procedures for applications for grants from the Fund; developed the rules and regulations which will govern the level of professional indemnity insurance which a Property Services Provider must have in place including the Minimum Terms and Conditions of such insurance; established a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services; prepared public information material on the provision of property services, including the purchase and sale of property; drafted a Code of Practice for Management Agents which is currently under discussion with relevant interested parties; drafted rules and regulations governing the complaints procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5521">In addition to the foregoing the implementation team is currently working on: drafting a Code of Practice for Letting Agents; reviewing all aspects of the work undertaken by Property Services Providers in Ireland and equivalent services in appropriate comparable jurisdictions for the purpose of prescribing the minimum education/qualification requirements necessary for the grant of licences; establishing protocols for the vetting by the Garda Síochána of all applicants for licences; drafting rules and regulations for the carrying out of investigations, inspections and audits of Property Services Providers' practices; drafting rules and regulations governing the operation of Property Services providers' accounting procedures including the manner of keeping all accounting records; drafting rules and regulations governing the operation of client accounts; prescribing the rights, duties and responsibilities of Property Services Providers in relation to monies received, held, controlled or paid in connection with the provision of property services; prescribing the rules governing the auditing of Property Services Providers' accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5522">Many of the rules and regulations which have been or are being drafted will be introduced once the Bill has been enacted.  The work undertaken to date by the Implementation Group will ensure that the complex systems, procedures, rules, regulations and protocols, necessary for the effective operation of the Authority, can be put in place quickly following the passing of the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5587">The prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs.  Numbers are particularly high when the courts are at their busiest, giving rise to a high number of committals. There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months, where we have seen dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences.  What is clear is that there is a trend of increased committals from the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5588">It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. For example, figures show, over the past 12 years, the numbers in custody have increased by 65%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5589">I acknowledge that our prisons are operating in excess of our bed capacity at this time.  It is also evident that the continuation of the current capital programme is necessary if overcrowding is not to become a problem going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_5590">The need for the continuation of the current building programme is set against a background whereby since 1997 in excess of 1,300 prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system. These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_5591">However, given the serious pressure that the Prison Service has been experiencing during the last 12-18 months, in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit.  This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.  Also in 2008, 70 new prison spaces were introduced at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House Open Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_5592">As the pressure shows no sign of abating the Irish Prison Service recently decided to increase their capacities through the doubling up of further cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit, thus creating 200 additional temporary bed spaces, some of which are already in place and others coming on stream shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5593">Furthermore, building projects in Castlerea, Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons are due to be completed in the coming months.  This will create an additional 400 extra spaces which will temporarily alleviate the situation pending the construction of new prisons at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin and Kilworth, Co. Cork.  It is my strong view that the continuation of the current capital programme is essential if we are to limit, as far as practicable, overcrowding so that we can accommodate our prisoner population is regime orientated modern prisons.</p>

            <p eId="para_5595">I am aware of the current serious humanitarian situation with regard to Roma families residing in camps in Kosovo which are exposed to dangerously high levels of lead. International Roma Day offers an opportunity to highlight this issue and others relating to the well-being of Roma worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_5596">Ireland continues to support all efforts to re-locate Roma families to safe facilities and we have raised this issue with relevant stakeholders on a number of occasions. During his visit to Kosovo on 22 December last, the Taoiseach, who was accompanied by the Minister for Defence, met with President Sejdiu and Prime Minister Thaçi. The issue of the displaced Roma was among the topics discussed. The Taoiseach particularly emphasised the plight of a group located at a camp in Gracanica.</p>
            <p eId="para_5597">The Government welcomes the fact that the Kosovar Government has indicated that it will make every effort to find a new location for the residents of the camps and establish arrangements for co-financing this project with other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5598">In addition, at my request, officials have raised this issue on a number of occasions in recent months, including at EU-level meetings and at meetings of the International Steering group on Kosovo. At an EU Working Group meeting on the Western Balkans on 1 April 2009, the European Special Representative in Kosovo, Mr. Pieter Feith gave an update on Roma families residing in camps exposed to lead contamination and expressed his full support for the closure of the camps and the re-location of Roma families. I fully support the endeavours of the European Commission Liaison Office in Pristina which is coordinating the efforts of national and international stakeholders to secure a long term sustainable solution to this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5599">Ireland has supported a broad range of projects targeted at assisting the Roma community in Kosovo. For the period 2005 to date, Irish Aid allocated €550,000 towards development work with the Roma community in Kosovo. In addition, €200,000 was provided for the World Bank's Roma Education Fund, which has benefited the Roma community in eleven countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_5600">The Government will continue to support all efforts to address the plight of the residents of the camps and will remain in contact with the responsible authorities on this issue, including through our Embassy in Budapest, which is accredited to Kosovo.</p>

            <p eId="para_5604">The total Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget for 2009 will be €696 million. €571 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the balance of €125 million being contributions to development co-operation by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_5605">The total budget of €696 million represents a reduction of €195 million from the original allocation of €891 million provided by the Government last October, under the Budget for 2009. The Irish Aid budget, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs under Vote 29, will absorb €183 million of this adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5606">Adjustments totalling €183 million will be implemented across the programme in such a way as to minimise the impact in any one area. The continuity and quality of our programmes will be maintained, but funding timeframes will be extended and disbursement rates modified.</p>
            <p eId="para_5607">I will ensure that Ireland's clear focus on poverty and hunger in the poorest countries, especially in Africa, is retained. We will maintain the strategic approach set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid. We will work even harder to ensure the effectiveness of Ireland's aid so that it continues to make a real difference to the lives of millions of poor people.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">We will maintain our position as one of the most generous donors internationally to the non-governmental sector. This year, notwithstanding the budget adjustments, Irish Aid will provide well over €100 million to NGOs and civil society. This is a very large sum and will make an enormous difference to the lives of millions in the developing world.    Currently Ireland is ranked sixth within the OECD countries and fifth in the EU in terms of both our per capita and percentage share of GNP spend on ODA.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">Our focus on our seven priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa will also continue, although the time-frames for specific programmes will be lengthened. Our programmes of strategic cooperation with key UN development agencies such as, inter alia, UNICEF and UNHCR will also be maintained, but within lengthened timelines. We also remain ready to assist in any sudden onset of natural disasters should they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">The decisions that we are taking in order to adjust the aid programme are framed in the context of our firm commitment to the world's poorest and our determination that, once the Irish economy has returned to a pattern of sustainable growth, we will resume the expansion of our aid programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5612">As a founding member of the Council of Europe, Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and its efforts to promote and protect human rights standards across member countries. Ireland has participated in recent discussions on the reform of the Court, which include proposals to increase the case-processing capacity of the Court aimed at alleviating the current backlog of cases, and we welcome the continuing efforts made by the Court to reduce the number of outstanding cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_5654">Events planned around the world to mark International Roma Day on 8 April 2009 provided an opportunity to highlight a number of important humanitarian issues facing this minority group, particularly in mainland Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">Ireland fully supports the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE in their ongoing efforts to bring all prejudice and mistreatment of the Roma people to a definitive end. In recognition of the need to support this vulnerable group, Ireland has contributed to a number of Roma projects, particularly in the Western Balkans region. One of the projects funded was €200,000 towards the World Bank's Roma Education Fund, which has benefited the Roma community in eleven countries in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">I was concerned to learn of reports that some Roma families were unable to find secure shelter following their evacuation by local authorities from a temporary settlement in Belgrade. I have asked officials at our Embassy in Athens, which is accredited to Serbia, to make enquiries about this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5657">The Deputy may also be aware of current efforts by the EU and others to relocate Roma families residing in camps exposed to lead contamination in Northern Kosovo. Ireland is supporting all efforts to address this urgent humanitarian issue, including that of the European Commission Liaison Office in Pristina, which is coordinating the actions of national and international stakeholders to secure a long-term sustainable solution to this issue.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5659">Given the gravity of the humanitarian and political situation in Sri Lanka, I very much welcome and support all international initiatives underway to relieve the humanitarian situation in the short term and thereafter to help bring about a swift resolution to the conflict there.</p>
            <p eId="para_5660">The Government have been strongly supportive of efforts by Mexico and others to have the humanitarian situation, and broader political context, raised at the UN Security Council. In my discussions with my Mexican counterpart, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ms Patricia Espinosa, in Mexico City on 16 March, I made clear our support for their efforts at the Security Council, where Mexico is currently serving as a non-permanent member. In New York, our Permanent Representative to the UN has repeatedly raised our very deep concerns about Sri Lanka, and our hopes for effective UN and international action at various meetings involving Members of the Security Council, EU Member States, other members of the UN, as well as with senior UN officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_5661">I very much regret that not all Members of the Security Council believe that the situation in Sri Lanka should be discussed at the Council. Some members of the Council argue that the conflict in Sri Lanka does not represent a threat to international peace and security. The Council has therefore been unable to formally discuss the issue, much less take any mandatory action in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5662">I am, of course, highly appreciative of activities across the UN system which are helping to redress the tragic humanitarian situation in the country. In this respect, I very much commend the commitment of the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and that of his Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, in relation to the conflict. I welcome in particular the visit by the Under Secretary General to Sri Lanka in mid-February, as well as the recent efforts of both men to bring about the declaration of the 48-hour ceasefire by the Sri Lankan Government on 12 April. I note also that the Secretary General's Chef de Cabinet, Vijay Nambiar, visited Colombo last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland has welcomed the temporary ceasefire but has called for it to be extended in order to facilitate humanitarian operations in the affected parts of the country and to ensure the physical safety of all civilians. In this respect, we welcome the commitment given by the Secretary General that the UN will do everything it can to help improve the grave predicament of civilians in the conflict zone.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_1068">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5667">I propose to take Questions Nos. 498 to 500, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5668">The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) was established pursuant to UN Resolution 60/251, adopted on 15 March 2006, to replace the much criticised Commission on Human Rights (CHR). Ireland fully supported the setting up of the Human Rights Council and, along with our EU partners, played an active part in the negotiations leading to its establishment. Together with the new Universal Periodic Review process, to which I will refer later, and other HRC activities we now effectively have a full-time standing body on human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_5669">The UN Human Rights Council is a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly. As such, funding for the HRC comes from the UN regular budget approved by the UN General Assembly in accordance with the agreed UN scale of assessments. Ireland's percentage contribution to the entire regular budget of the UN for 2008-09 is 0.445%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5670">The Human Rights Council has been criticised — rightly — for its focus on Israel and the Occupied Territories, which while legitimate is excessive relative to abuses elsewhere in the world, and for its failure to renew mandates in regard to countries such as Cuba and Belarus. However, it remains the pre-eminent international forum for dealing with human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">The Council has a number of key advantages over the old Commission on Human Rights. Its sitting periods have been greatly extended and it now holds at least three regular sessions annually and can also call special sessions to discuss emergency situations. The new Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism, which subjects each member State to a thorough review of its human rights record every four years, is a key innovation of the Council and its universal nature counters charges of selectivity. The mechanism is still relatively new and its full value will emerge in time as more countries are reviewed and there is additional reporting and follow-up on the implementation of recommendations. However early indications are largely positive and it is clear that the UPR has the potential to be an effective mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">The fact that the membership of the Human Rights Council is more reflective of the overall membership of the UN and weighted less towards western countries than that of its predecessor has impacted on the ability of the Council to take decisions in support of human rights. Greater effort now has to be put into winning the support of developing countries which, while sometimes frustrating in the short term, is no bad thing over a longer perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_5673">While progress so far at the Council has been slower than the Government would have liked, we nonetheless continue to see the potential of the HRC to strengthen the cause of human rights around the world. In this regard, I welcome the recent decision of the United States to engage with the Council and to seek a seat on the Council this year. Ireland, along with our EU partners, looks forward to working with the United States, if elected, and other partners to address the weaknesses of the Council with the aim of achieving our shared objectives in the field of human rights. With regard to proposals to reform the workings of the Council, Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and like-minded others to strengthen the Council and its mechanisms. As mandated by the resolution which led to its establishment, a review of the work and functioning of the HRC will take place in 2011, five years after the establishment of the Council. In conjunction with our EU partners, Ireland intends to engage fully with this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_5674">Since its inception, the Human Rights Council has held ten regular sessions and ten special sessions, with more than 150 resolutions adopted at these meetings. Information on all of these texts can be viewed on the Council's website: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/. The majority of these resolutions have been adopted by consensus and a smaller number have been voted on by the 47 elected members of the Council. The current members of the Council are: Angola, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Cuba, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay and Zambia.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">Ireland has not yet been a member of the Human Rights Council (and as such does not having voting rights on resolutions) but attends all sessions as an observer State. Our commitment to the Council is evidenced by our decision to stand for election for the first time in 2012, for the first time, for the term 2012-2015. This term will coincide with Ireland's planned EU Presidency in 2013 and it will be important to have a seat on the Council for this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">Of the ten special sessions of the Human Rights Council convened to discuss urgent human rights situations, five of these sessions requested in their outcomes that fact-finding missions be undertaken to further investigate the situations considered. A tabular statement of such missions, providing the information sought, is attached for the Deputy's information. Ireland has not been involved in such investigations. I would have concerns about the capacity of the HRC to arrange for the investigation of alleged breaches of human rights, particularly where member States directly involved do not agree to or cooperate satisfactorily with such missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">Among the other mechanisms available to the HRC to address human rights concerns are its ‘ special procedures'. This is the term given to the mechanisms established by the Commission on Human Rights and assumed by the Human Rights Council to address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Currently, there are 30 thematic and 8 country mandates. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights provides these mechanisms with personnel, logistical and research assistance to support them in the discharge of their mandates.</p>

            <p eId="para_5697">The total official development assistance (ODA) budget for 2009 will be €696 million.  Some €571 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the balance of €125 million being contributions to development co-operation by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.  On current projections, total funding of €696 million will represent 0.48% of Gross National Product (GNP) in 2009.  Expenditure on ODA in 2008 amounted to 0.58% of GNP.  Ireland is currently ranked sixth in the OECD countries and fifth in the EU in terms of our per capita and percentage shares of GNP spend on official development assistance.  I regret that it has been necessary to reduce funding to the development assistance programme for 2009.  The decision to reduce the budget was difficult but necessary in the context of the economic situation that the country faces.  The reduction is one of a series of measures designed to restore the public finances and establish a solid platform for renewed economic growth.  I am acutely aware of the implications of the ODA cuts.  Our aid programme is renowned internationally for its clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger and on the least developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  I am determined that we will maintain this focus and that we will continue to work closely with our partners in pursuit of our shared goals of reducing poverty in line with the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5698">The Government decision to reduce the ODA budget for 2009 will make it more difficult to achieve the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012.  Nevertheless, we will continue to work towards the target.  A full assessment of our capacity to achieve this goal will be made in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget.  It is important to note that Ireland is still significantly ahead of all but a few EU member states in making progress towards achieving the broad EU 0.7% of GNP target in 2015.  While I understand the disappointment in relation to the temporary reverse of the growth in our aid programme, it is worth stepping back a little to reflect on what we have achieved over the past few years.  To have become the world's sixth biggest donor per head in a relatively short period of time is an extraordinary and unparalleled achievement.  It is also expected that Ireland will retain this ranking in 2009.  This remains an enormous achievement.  A major review of Ireland's aid programme by the OECD, a key peer review which is carried out every five years, will be published shortly.  It states that "Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective".  This is an important, independent, international endorsement of the work of our aid programme from which we can all draw pride.  It confirms that the aid programme will remain one of the most effective in the world.  We retain our core values of supporting the world's poorest people in a way that builds capacity and addresses the fundamental causes of poverty.  We are determined that, once we have got our economy back into a pattern of sustainable growth, we can resume our expansion of our development co-operation volumes.</p>

            <p eId="para_5700">I have made clear the Government's strong condemnation of all uses of military force contrary to international law.  This can relate to the types of weapons used and to the way in which weapons are used.  It applies to all uses intentionally aimed at causing civilian casualties.  There is no realistic proposal for an arms embargo which would address this problem in relation to the Middle East.  There is no prospect of international agreement at UN or EU level for such an arms embargo.  A total embargo would be opposed by many on the basis that Israel is entitled to defend itself, although I have made clear that this right is not unlimited and does not negate the rights of others.  Nor would such an embargo realistically address the issue of supply of weapons to Hamas and other groups, including for example missiles used solely for attacks on civilians, since these weapons are supplied covertly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5702">The current situation in Georgia, following the outbreak of conflict there in August 2008, is tense but relatively stable.  Since the conflict, continued efforts by the international community, most notably the European Union, the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, have helped to return stability to the region.  Work is continuing with a view to achieving a sustainable resolution to the conflicts in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The EU monitoring mission was deployed on 1 October 2008 in accordance with the arrangements set out in the agreement negotiated by the French EU Presidency on 8 September.  Together with the missions provided by the UN and the OSCE, the EU mission continues to play a vital role in monitoring the situation on the ground in Georgia. Ireland has contributed four personnel to the EU monitoring mission.  EU member states, including Ireland, have provided vital humanitarian assistance to those affected by fighting.  The peace talks that were inaugurated in Geneva on 15 October 2008 remain an essential element in achieving dialogue between the Russian Federation and Georgia.  The fifth round of these talks is scheduled for 18 and 19 May 2009 in Geneva.  As regards developments within Georgia, the Deputy may be aware that a large protest took place in Tbilisi on 9 April 2009 which called for the resignation of President Mikheil Saakashvili.  The demonstration passed off peacefully and without incident.  Ireland, together with its EU partners, supports the territorial integrity of Georgia and will continue to monitor the situation there closely and support every effort to find a lasting and peaceful resolution to this conflict.</p>

            <p eId="para_5704">The Deputy will be aware that the parliamentary elections in Moldova took place on 5 April and resulted in a victory for the ruling Communist Party.  On 6 April, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe's office of democratic institutions and human rights released a statement noting that the elections had met many international standards but that further improvements were required, including the need to ensure public confidence in the process.  Ireland contributed one long-term observer and ten short-term observers to the election observation mission.  I understand that protests took place after the election which started off peacefully.  However, after the outbreak of violent incidents, the Moldovan government arrested a number of demonstrators.  In a related development, the government accused the opposition of plotting to overthrow it and blamed Romania for instigating the demonstrations, a charge Romania denies.  My information is that a number of steps have been taken against Romanian interests in the country.  At the request of Romania, the situation in Moldova will be discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council that I will attend next Monday, 27 April.  The EU will continue to make every effort to ensure stability in Moldova and to encourage dialogue between the Moldovan government and opposition.  In doing so, however, it will not lose sight of the need to draw the attention of the Moldovan government to its international obligations in regard to the rule of law and human rights for those arrested in the period following the election.</p>

            <p eId="para_5738">As I have said on many occasions in this House, most recently on 24 March, I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka and in particular about the grave humanitarian situation there.  Thanks to the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a two-day ceasefire on 12 April.  While this was less than the full humanitarian pause of several days which the Secretary General had pressed for, it was nevertheless seen as an opportunity to try to relieve the horrendous suffering of the local population trapped in the conflict zone by providing them with some opportunity to evacuate and to access humanitarian assistance.  While some civilians succeeded in escaping from the conflict zone during the temporary ceasefire period agreed to by the Sri Lankan government, the figure was not as great as had been expected.  There were reports that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were preventing civilians from leaving the area.  Over the last few days, however, it has been reported that up to 40,000 civilians have succeeded in escaping through breaches in barricades, bringing to over 100,000 the number who have fled the zone.  Although there are no reliable figures for the numbers still trapped in the rapidly shrinking zone still under the control of the LTTE, it is clear than tens of thousands of civilians are at grave risk as the war moves into what may well be its final and most intensive phase.  Earlier this week, the LTTE rejected a call on them from the Sri Lankan army to surrender within 24 hours to prevent further bloodshed.  The current indications are that the LTTE intends to fight this out until the bitter end.  Army operations have since intensified and gained significant ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_5739">Together with its partners in the EU, Ireland welcomed the temporary ceasefire but called for it to be extended to facilitate humanitarian operations in the affected parts of the country and ensure the physical safety of all civilians.  I regret that this did not happen.  I remain gravely concerned about the plight of the many thousands of innocent men, women and children, many of them wounded or ill, who are still trapped in the war zone.  I welcome the fact that up to 100,000 of those who have fled the zone have increased access to humanitarian support.  I commend the excellent work being done by organisations such as the ICRC, UNHCR, and Médecins Sans Frontières, whose activities Irish Aid have been supporting.  I welcome the recent visit by the UN Secretary General's Chef de Cabinet, Vijay Nambiar, to Colombo last week.  I hope the UN will be able to engage more proactively with the Sri Lankan government while this appalling humanitarian tragedy continues and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_5740">I continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties. A lasting peace settlement will require serious reconciliation efforts and a negotiated political process aimed at protecting the interests of all the citizens of Sri Lanka and enshrining the principle of parity of esteem among its divided communities.  Ireland would welcome further activity by the international community, in particular by the UN Security Council, to help to bring about a swift resolution to the conflict with minimum loss of life and to support a negotiated peace process and reconciliation.  If the relevant parties seek our advice in relation to a negotiated peace process, we will give consideration as to how we could best help.  I am strongly supportive of the efforts that have been made and are continuing to be made to persuade the Sri Lankan government and the representatives of the Tamil people to engage in serious efforts to resolve their differences through negotiations, rather than warfare, and to seek a sustainable peace based on the principle of parity of esteem among the divided communities.  Along with senior UN officials, the members of the Tokyo Co-Chairs group that supports the Sri Lankan peace process — Norway, the US, the EU and Japan — have engaged in diplomatic activities in respect of the humanitarian situation.  Some of them have also focused on the broader political context.  Following an attack on the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oslo on 12 April, the Sri Lankan government has regrettably indicated that it is no longer feasible for Norway to act as facilitator in its engagement with Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p eId="para_5741">Since 2005, the Government has provided more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka.  Over $12 million was allocated to Sri Lanka from the UN's central emergency response fund, to which Ireland is the seventh largest donor, in 2008.  The International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency, which are two of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the humanitarian crisis, also receive regular unearmarked funding from Irish Aid.  In view of the perilous situation in the affected areas, a decision has been taken to offer additional Irish Aid funding of €170,000 to Médecins Sans Frontières, which is treating large numbers of civilians affected by the conflict.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation in northern Sri Lanka.  The possible provision of additional emergency funding is being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5743">Following the decision to establish an interdepartmental group to examine options for the future development of Spike Island as a tourism project, the group met for the first time on 21 September 2007 in the offices of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in Dublin.  Following that meeting, it was agreed that the various bodies represented on the group would provide a synopsis of their interest, involvement or role in relation to Spike Island, their potential role in developing, supporting or operating the island as a tourism project, and what form, if any, they consider the project might take.  The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism subsequently prepared and circulated a comprehensive questionnaire to the relevant Departments and bodies to elicit this information.  These contributions will form the basis of a report which the group will then consider for agreement.  I expect that the group will soon consider what options arise for the future development of Spike Island as a result of these consultations and deliberations.  Any recommendations or conclusions in a report of the group in relation to possible future developments on the site will be for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to consider in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_5745">The Supplementary Budget for 2009 was necessary to bring stability to the public finances, restore economic activity and enhance Ireland's competitiveness.  In this regard, it is critical to manage the immediate economic difficulties so that Ireland is well positioned to take full advantage of the international economic recovery when it arrives.  Expenditure in relation to arts, culture and film has been reduced by €41 million from €221 million in 2008 to €180 million in 2009, a reduction of18.5%.  Within this, the reduction in current expenditure is just 6% while the reduction in capital expenditure is 42%, owing primarily to the completion of once-off major capital projects such as the Wexford Opera House and the Gate Theatre extension.  Expenditure in relation to sports, recreation services and the horse and greyhound racing industry has been reduced by €141 million from €336 million in 2008 to €195 million in 2009, a reduction of 42%.  However, the 2008 figure includes a once-off expenditure of €116 million in relation to the Lansdowne Road stadium project.  When this sum is excluded, the reduction in relation to sport for 2009 is of the order of 11%.  Expenditure in relation to tourism has been reduced by €16 million from €169 million in 2008 to €153 million in 2009, a reduction of 9.5%.  Having regard to the foregoing, I successfully sought to minimise reductions in the Arts, Sport and Tourism core budgets, in accordance with the Government's stated priority of protecting economic sectors that contribute to job creation, foreign revenue earnings and tax yield to the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5747">I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of an official review of the operation of the 30-year rule in the United Kingdom, which recently recommended that the relevant timeframe be reduced to 15 years.  The UK recommendation is that this be done two years at a time over a period of 15 years starting in 2010 and running until 2024.  The British Government is considering this recommendation.  The report of the official review has been published at <i>www.30yearrulereview.org.uk/default.htm</i>.  The British report is based partly on research showing that some countries release records to public inspection after periods significantly shorter than 30 years.  The report concludes that the maintenance of the present 30-year rule is anachronistic and unsustainable, as freedom of information legislation has decisively and irreversibly enhanced the right of the public to greater access to much more recent official information.  In Ireland, however, most Departments hold significant quantities of records that are more than 30 years old.  The principal reason for this is the adequacy of the storage available in the National Archives.</p>

            <p eId="para_5749">Under the National Archives Act 1986, the general rule is that all Departmental records which are more than 30 years old must be transferred to the National Archives and made available for inspection by the public.  Particular records may be retained by Departments and/or be withheld from public inspection only if they are covered by certificates stating either that they are in regular use in a Department or are required in connection with its administration or that making them available for inspection by the public would or might be contrary to the public interest, constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or cause distress or danger to living persons on the grounds that they contain information about individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5750">At present, only the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Secretary to the President and the Office of the Attorney General have transferred all records that are more than 30 years old and are not covered by retention certificates.  Most other Departments have transferred all records predating 1960 and have transferred significant quantities of more recent records, but retain records of varying size.  The position at the end of each calendar year is summarised in an appendix to the report of the director of the National Archives for that year.  The director's reports up to 2006 are available on the National Archives website and in the Oireachtas Library.  His report for 2007 is under consideration by my Department, and his report for 2008 will be submitted to me next month (May).  Departments are responsible for ensuring that all records that are more 30 years old are identified prior to transfer.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach, the reference numbers of all files relating to matters considered by Government are specified in the relevant minutes of Government meetings and care is taken to ensure that all such files are included in each annual transfer.</p>

The Irish Sports Council does not operate a scholarship scheme for athletes to study abroad.  However, the international carding scheme provides a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist Ireland's most talented players and Olympic and Paralympic athletes who have the potential to reach finals at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Some €68.128 million has been allocated to the fund for 2009.  In accordance with the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon respectively.  Therefore, €54.502 million has been allocated to Horse Racing Ireland for 2009.  To date, the fund has not only helped to provide some top class racing venues and facilities, but has also underpinned significant employment in the horse racing and breeding industry.  Funding of Horse Racing Ireland supports an important productive industry and helps to sustain the important role of the horse breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  The horse racing and breeding industry supports an estimated 16,500 jobs, generates substantial economic activity and makes a vital contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.  This funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.  Horse Racing Ireland has undertaken a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  Statistics provided by Horse Racing Ireland show that at least 80,000 tourists come to Ireland each year to attend race meetings at this country's 27 courses; the Punchestown and Galway festivals are worth €105 million to their local economies; the horse racing and breeding industry generates exports worth nearly €200 million annually to 43 different countries; and the industry produces a gross economic contribution exceeding €330 million annually.</p>

This was done with a view to affording my Department an opportunity to review its operation over the next few months and relaunch it later in the year.  Yesterday, I met representatives of organisations involved with issues affecting older people.  I agreed with them a process that will set the broad parameters for the review and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of it.  I am hopeful that the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid-September.  I would like to reassure the Deputies that all applications received up to the suspension of the scheme will be processed and approved, as appropriate, in line with the current eligibility criteria.  In addition, it is important to note that the suspension of the scheme in no way affects those who already have received a monitored alarm device.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5837">I propose to take Questions Nos. 533, 538 to 540, inclusive, and 551 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5838">In order to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to prevent their becoming welfare dependent from a young age, changes are being made to the Jobseeker's Allowance. The rate of Jobseeker's Allowance that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 is being reduced from €204.30 per week to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009. This decision was made on foot of ongoing consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government. It is not discriminatory but rather a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5839">Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at 18 years of age, without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from an early age. If they do not improve their skills, such young persons are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age. Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide 18 and 19 year old jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment that pays more than €100 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5840">The fact that 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a FÁS or similar training/ education course will get the full rate of the relevant payment (e.g. FÁS training allowance, Community Employment rate, Back to Education Allowance), instead of €100 on Jobseeker's Allowance, should also be a major incentive for such participation. Individuals will be required to access such courses if they are to receive a full rate payment. However, young people with dependent children will not have their rates reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_5841">Primarily delivered through FÁS, there is a wide range of courses being made available to persons aged 18 or 19 years and additional Post –Leaving Cert courses are being made available through Vocational Education Committees. Also this Department has a range of education and employment supports available to people in receipt of welfare payments. The overall aim is to assist persons to return to the active labour market by enhancing their employability. This is done through the operation of programmes including the back to education and back to work allowance enterprise schemes. In addition, the Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and other disadvantaged persons, including young people aged 18 to 19, to assist them to improve their employability and personal and family situations. Schemes will continue to be monitored in light of the changing economic circumstances to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_5843">Payment of Illness Benefit, to the person concerned, was discontinued from 22 November 2008 following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. An appeal was opened 27 November 2008 and, in the context of that appeal, her case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor on 2 January 2009 who also expressed the opinion she was capable of work. I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that in the light of this second medical opinion, that office, on 6 January 2009, decided to afford her an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal. Documentation from the Department on this case has been received by an appeals officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing. The person concerned will be informed when arrangements for this hearing have been made. The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5845">There are no plans to reconsider the decision not to publish a National Carer's Strategy at this time. During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy. However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged. The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended. The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits. A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package. These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008. In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5848">In Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant. It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to work with the carer representative groups to deliver services in the most effective way and to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in helping carers.</p>

            <p eId="para_5911">The PRSI system has a number of features designed to facilitate access to employment. Among these are the reduced rates of employer PRSI payable at lower income levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_5912">Class A PRSI is the social insurance class paid by most ordinary employees, encompassing circa 80% of all insured persons. The AO and AX subclasses feature a reduced 8.50% rate of employer PRSI, as opposed to the general employer rate of 10.75%. These subclasses are payable in respect of employments where weekly pay is €356 or lower.</p>
            <p eId="para_5913">In general, young people entering the workforce do so in junior or part-time positions with lower rates of pay. For such employments the lower rates of employer PRSI act as substantial incentive to employers to create opportunities for young people to enter the workforce. Any future changes to PRSI rates would be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_5919">I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 553 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5920">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_5921">In recent years a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods.  There are currently almost 84,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 40% since the end of December 2007.  Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5922">Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.  Maximum rent limits are prescribed in regulations and are time limited so that they can be adjusted in the light of rent levels generally.  The most recent regulations cover the period to 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5923">The recent Supplementary Budget provided for changes to be made to the rent supplement scheme. One of the measures being introduced is the reduction in the maximum level of rent supplement payable by the State in respect of all new tenancies or on renewals of tenancies. The limits will be reduced by up 6% to 7% on average, ranging up to 10%, depending on the geographical area and household size and by reference to an analysis of rent supplement and the Private Residential Tenancies Board rent data as well as the downward trends in private rents as recently published by the CSO.  Trends in the private rent sector indicate that rents have fallen considerably in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5924">Payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants are being reduced by 8% in the expectation that landlords will reduce their rents given the reductions in the market as a whole. While tenants are contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally. It is essential that state support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.  The new maximum rent limits will be prescribed in regulations to be made in the coming weeks and to take effect from 1 June 2009. These regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5926">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5927">The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  In general a person may be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement provided that: s/he is habitually resident in the State, the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, the person was in a position to meet the repayments, the residence in respect of which the loan is payable, is not offered for sale; the mortgage interest payable does not exceed such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs. In exceptional circumstances, a supplement may be awarded where the mortgage interest exceeds such amount as the Executive considers reasonable but such a supplement is payable for a maximum of 12 months only; s/he satisfies a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_5928">Mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to family circumstances less a minimum weekly contribution, currently €18, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  This minimum contribution is being increased to €24 with effect from 1 June 2009.  Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5929">The existing mortgage interest supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. In recent years improvements have been made to the means test to encourage eligible people to engage in employment without losing their entire mortgage interest supplement. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.  Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5930">In view of the current economic environment, the Department has commenced a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_5933">I am advised by that office that the appeals officer, having considered all the available evidence, including that adduced at an oral hearing, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned on the grounds that she did not rebut the findings of the Department's medical assessors that she was not incapable of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5934">Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive but may be reviewed by the appeals officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  I am advised that further medical evidence was submitted by the person concerned and was forwarded to the Chief Medical Advisor for consideration on 4 March 2009.  The CMO confirmed that the information submitted would not have affected the findings of the previous medical assessments and, as a result, the appeals officer did not consider that a revised decision was warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5935">By way of further review, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that the chief appeals officer may revise any decision where it appears to him that the appeals officer's decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.  In making a request for such a review an appellant must set down the reasons he or she believes a mistake was made having regard to the application of the law or the facts.</p>

The grant of paid sick leave without an accompanying medical certificate is a privilege which is withdrawn after 7 days.  A case will not be referred to the Chief Medical Officer solely on uncertified sick leave but on the overall sick leave record.

The Department has published its Customer Charter where it clearly outlines our commitments and objectives in the whole area of customer service.

            <p eId="para_5970">The changes that are being made to the Jobseekers Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance schemes are to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and prevent them becoming welfare dependent from a young age.  The rates of the schemes that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 are being reduced to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009. The Qualified Adult rate (e.g. for a spouse/partner) payable in these cases will also be reduced to €100 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5971">It is important to note that the following people will not be affected: Existing claimants; People with dependent children; Those who qualify for the Jobseeker's Benefit; and People transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or those transferring from the Disability Allowance directly to Jobseeker's Allowance.  Also, where an existing Jobseeker's Allowance claimant under age 20 (being paid the full adult rate) gets a job and leaves Jobseeker's Allowance but loses that job and ends up back on the scheme within 12 months, he or she will get the full adult rate rather than €100 a week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5972">The importance of providing aftercare services to young people leaving State care is widely recognised.  It is acknowledged that the implementation of an effective leaving and aftercare policy strengthens the position of such young people, supports their transition to independence, reduces the possibility of homelessness and social exclusion and represents a key element in achieving positive outcomes for them.  The Department is aware that 18 and 19 year olds leaving the care of the Health Service Executive might be particularly vulnerable to these reductions in the rates. This issue is currently being examined further in co-operation with the Department of Health and Children.</p>

Mobile phone transmitters found in Ireland comply with the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection) exposure limits that have been recommended by the European Commission to its Member States and they provide science-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from RF and ELF fields. They also provide sound guidance on limiting exposure from mobile phones and masts. The following public exposure limit values apply:</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_6049">I propose to take Questions Nos. 568 and 591 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6050">The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating (BER) system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6051">The Regulations clearly and unambiguously specify that any person who offers a building for sale or letting on or from 1 January, 2009 or any agent acting on their behalf, is required to produce a copy of the BER certificate to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting in the building.  A person who contravenes these requirements commits an offence, unless the building in question is specifically exempted under Article 3 of the Regulations, and is liable, on prosecution by the Building Control Authority in whose functional area the building is situated, to a fine not exceeding €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_6052">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is designated as the issuing authority for the purposes of the Regulations and is responsible for the day to day administration of the BER system. SEI has already run an extensive advertising and promotion campaign to raise public awareness regarding the BER certification system and plans to run further national and regional media campaigns by mid-year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6053">The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and its principal functions are in the area of:</p>
            <p eId="para_6054">the registration of private rental tenancies;</p>
            <p eId="para_6055">the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6056">the provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector</p>
            <p eId="para_6057">The PRTB has no function in ensuring private rental sector compliance with the Regulations. Notwithstanding this, the Board is aware of the Regulations and has indicated it will take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the requirement for BER certificates within the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6058">Circular Letter BC 4/2009 — Enforcing Building Regulations Part L and Building Energy Ratings — issued to all Building Control Authorities on 17 February 2009.   The Circular Letter, among other things, asked all local authorities to write to estate and letting agents within their functional area drawing their attention to the mandatory requirement for BER certificates in respect of buildings offered for sale or letting on or from 1 January 2009 and indicating that full compliance was expected from building owners and agents acting on behalf of owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_6059">It is not currently a requirement that energy ratings be quoted on advertising and promotional materials relating to the sale or letting of a building.  The European Commission is, however, advancing such proposals in its recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, and I am supportive of these proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_6060">SEI's Code of Conduct for BER Assessors specifically debars a BER assessor from undertaking an assessment on a building in which his employer has an interest as a sales or letting agent.</p>
            <p eId="para_6061">My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, SEI and the 37 local Building Control Authorities to promote awareness of the obligations which arise under the Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_6072">At my request, the Dublin Regional Authority established the Dublin Bay Task Force in May 2008, essentially to prepare a draft Master Plan for Dublin Bay and make recommendations in relation to institutional arrangements for coastal zone management in the Bay.  The Task Force operates under the aegis of the Regional Authority and is chaired by the Cathaoirleach of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_6073">A list of groups and organizations represented on the Task Force is set out below.  The composition of the Task Force reflects recommendations I made to the Authority in 2008 with a view to ensuring the engagement of key stakeholders and decision-makers, though ultimately membership is a matter for the Authority.  I made no direct appointments to the Task Force. There is no set term of office for Task Force members.</p>
            <p eId="para_6074">At the outset, it was anticipated that the work of the Task Force would, to the extent necessary, be financed by contributions from my Department's vote, the local authorities concerned and possibly the commercial port companies represented. My Department is examining the scope for part-funding the work of the Task Force having regard to current pressures on all areas of the Department's expenditure. I am not aware of the intentions of the relevant local authorities in this regard.</p>

Many of these are already in process of sale or will be sold in the coming months.  In light of analysis by the Affordable Homes Partnership and engagement with local authorities, a circular issued to authorities recently setting out guidance on addressing the stock of affordable homes. As part of the overall process of monitoring the status of affordable housing over time, local authorities have been requested to provide data in relation to their affordable housing stock which will be input into an on-line information system to be managed by the Affordable Homes Partnership, on behalf of the Department and local authorities.   This will facilitate the collection of more detailed information on affordable housing stock for the future. I will forward a breakdown of the number of unsold affordable units in each area to the Deputy when these returns are obtained.</p>

The number of tenancies registered each year cannot be taken as a proxy indicator of annualised lettings due to the exemptions referred to above and also due to the fact that a proportion of tenancy registrations are re-registrations of existing tenancies.</p>

            <p eId="para_6162">The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 provides for the introduction of an Incremental Purchase Scheme for lower income households assessed as eligible for social housing support and who wish to become home owners.

The scheme is currently being market tested by local authorities through a number of demonstration projects.  It is intended that the scheme would be released nationally in 2010 following enactment of the Bill.</p>

Local authorities are best positioned to make judgments in this regard based on local circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_6197">From the information supplied by the Deputy, it would appear that the contractor is proposing to pump insulation into the wall, filling the hollows of cavity blocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6198">The Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) provides grant assistance for cavity wall insulation.  Typically, cavity walls consist of two rows of brick or concrete block, with a cavity or space between them.  Injection of insulating product from the outside is an ideal method for insulating this type of wall.</p>
            <p eId="para_6199">SEI advises that it does not consider this method to be suitable for houses built with cavity blocks (as opposed to cavity walls), as the injected insulating material does not reduce heat movement significantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_6200">SEI advises that while pumping the cavity of the block may achieve 80% ‘coverage' of the wall area, the more significant proportion of heat loss occurs through the cavity block ends and spine and not the filled in cavity.  The pumped in insulation does not address this heat loss and so will only improve the insulation properties of the wall by approximately 22%.</p>
            <p eId="para_6201">SEI advises that the two alternative methods grant aided under the Scheme — internal wall dry-lining and external wall insulation — are more appropriate for cavity block houses.  While more expensive, they provide a greatly superior insulation solution.  The respective grant amounts of €2,500 and €4,000 reflect the extra capital investment required.</p>
            <p eId="para_6202">My Department has asked SEI to make direct contact with the individuals concerned to ensure that they have all the necessary, impartial, technical information to inform their decision.</p>

For boiler installations, a level 6 qualification in a related area such as Building Services, Gas Installer Domestic (GID) training etc., may also suffice.  The contractor must have completed an electrical module in order to carry out the electrical work involved in specific control measures.  A contractor wishing to install an LPG or Natural Gas boiler must also be a Registered Gas Contractor and hold a Gas Contractors Domestic Certificate (GID, GI 2 or GI 3) or equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_6207">SEI also specifies various competency requirements for contractors installing the different insulation measures eligible under the Scheme.  In general these requirements relate to the competency required to install the measure concerned, inclusion on any Approved Installer lists operated by manufacturers of the insulation material concerned, and compliance with the requirements of any NSAI Agrément Certificate that may apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_6210">Applications for grid connections are made to ESB Networks and/or EirGrid, in the first instance.  Data on grid connections has been published by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) as part of its consultation process on grid connections and additional information is published from time to time by EirGrid.</p>
            <p eId="para_6211">The Government has set targets to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed to 15% by 2010 and 40% by 2020.  Steady progress is being made towards the 2010 target.  The CER and EirGrid have calculated that 5800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity is required to achieve the 40% target in 2020.  The latest figures from EirGrid and the CER show that there are in excess of 1,300 MW of renewable electricity capacity already connected to the system with a further 1,500 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">The recent CER decision on the ‘Gate 3' round provides for connection offers for 3,900 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  The size of the gate 3 round was initially set at 3,000MW of capacity by the CER but this was increased to 3,900MW of capacity in line with the Government's renewable electricity 2020 target of 40%.  The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER and all industry stakeholders were afforded the opportunity of responding to the proposed connection process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6213">The projects for Gate 3 were selected on a date application completed process so those projects longest in the queue were dealt with first.  The projects in the Gate 3 process are currently being assessed as part of the connection process and there is no fixed date to bring in any additional projects at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_6221">The Flagford-Srananagh project is a vital transmission reinforcement, which has full planning consent from the planning authorities and which is under development and is being developed by EirGrid.  This project involves the development of 220kV network and 110kV network in the northwest, from Flagford, County Roscommon to Srananagh in County Sligo.  Work on this project is continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6222">I have no direct role in the operational planning and construction of the transmission system infrastructure.  The Government's policy objective is to ensure that energy is consistently available with minimal risk of supply disruption to meet the needs of businesses and domestic consumers.  It is EirGrid's role, as the national transmission system operator, to develop and upgrade the transmission system in order to meet ongoing and future electricity needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6223">In response to public concerns my Department commissioned an independent study on overhead electricity transmission lines versus underground cables in 2008.  This independent study undertaken by international consultants Ecofys, concluded that underground cables do not compare favourably to overhead lines in terms of adequacy of the electricity transmission system.  The study also noted that internationally, overhead lines are the standard choice for high voltage transmission connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_6224">I am aware of the Danish decision in relation to undergrounding of electricity infrastructure. This decision, however, relates primarily to lower voltage networks.  In the immediate term the Danish Authorities intend to retain existing high voltage networks and to construct further high voltage networks using overhead technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_6225">Transmission projects such as the Flagford-Srananagh project are vital in order to maintain and improve high quality supplies to all consumers in the region, in order to assist economic recovery and balanced regional development, and in order to connect increasing amounts of renewable energy to the grid.</p>

In this regard EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the NBS (which was approved by the EU Commission) is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>

            <p eId="para_6340">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) are the primary agency with responsibility for the enforcement of EU legislation in regard to the labelling of fisheries products.</p>
            <p eId="para_6341">The case referred to by the deputy was brought against a company for breach of the EU labelling regulations, it was dismissed, not for salmon labelling issues but because the judge felt that the evidence put before her did not adequately prove that the salmon was farmed as set out in European Council Regulation 1198/2006.  I understand that FSAI and Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) are reviewing the case in its totality and the implications arising and their findings are awaited.</p>
            <p eId="para_6342">Potential damage to Ireland by companies trying to manipulate legislation to gain some sort of competitive advantage must be prevented and any such activities will not be condoned.</p>
            <p eId="para_6343">In the overall context, I would favour a strengthening of the current labelling EU Regulations to ensure that there is more information available to the consumer.</p>

The law requires that other animals which die on farms must also generally be disposed of through rendering plants.  Farmers may continue to use the existing collection network or, in the alternative, may transport dead animals by prior arrangement to approved plants, provided they transport the carcasses in leak-proof, covered containers or vehicles.</p>

Such licences can only be issued in respect of fallen animals in remote areas i.e. listed islands, boglands and mountains.  All keepers of bovine animals are reminded of the legal requirement to notify movements of all bovines (live and dead) off their holdings to my Department.</p>

REPS applications will continue to be accepted up to the predetermined closing date of 15th May and, depending on the number of applications received, I will then review the payment level for REPS 3 participants.  I will be also be carrying out a review of the scheme in the context of the overall level of participation, the funding which is likely to be available to me and the flexibility provided by the additional funding which I negotiated in the recent CAP "Health Check".  In the context of 2010, I intend to look at and discuss with our stakeholders how we can use unused CAP funds and modulated monies, including the options in relation to REPS, to achieve the maximum benefit for Irish farmers and the agri-food sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_6420">Under cross compliance requirements, a farmer in receipt of direct payments, including Single Payment Scheme (SPS), Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS), Rural Environment Protection Scheme 4 (REPS4) and Organics must respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation (Directives and Regulations) on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health and must maintain their lands in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC).</p>
            <p eId="para_6421">Under GAEC, the requirement is that farmers must "maintain soil organic matter levels through appropriate practices".  If a parcel has been under tillage cropping continuously farmers must ensure through soil sampling that organic matter levels are maintained through the use of appropriate farming practices.  Where organic matter levels are depleted (&lt; 3.4% organic matter) it may be necessary, depending on soil type, to adopt farming practices that will restore organic matter levels in the soil.  Compliance with this requirement will be checked in the course of cross compliance inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_6422">My Department will communicate with applicants who have applied on such parcels on their SPS application in areas identified as potentially having low levels of organic matter.  These applicants must determine the percentage soil organic matter levels in 2009 and where found to be less than 3.4%, remedial action appropriate for the soil type must be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_6423">The purpose of this requirement is to ensure the protection of Irish soils. Research in this area indicates that for some soils, organic matter levels below 3.4% may expose these soils to degradation through soil erosion, compaction or declining productivity.  This requirement will have limited impact on farmers involved in continuous tillage as the soil organic matter levels in most Irish soils are significantly above the threshold level of 3.4% organic matter</p>
            <p eId="para_6424">Further information in relation to soil organic matter and the appropriate remedial actions if required is available from Cross Compliance Farm Advisory Service advisors.  In addition information on this good agricultural and environmental condition will be provided on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food web site at www.agriculture.gov.ie.  A listing of Cross Compliance Farm Advisory Service advisors is also available on the Department's web site.</p>

            <p eId="para_6450">The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate for different classes of applicants.  This power would enable me, if there are compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider extending the circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental income.  My Department is currently reviewing the circumstances where a means assessment independent of parental income would be appropriate and in the context of the development of a new unified scheme of student support, is undertaking further consultation on this and related matters with a view to establishing the particular circumstances where assessment as an independent student might be warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_6451">Any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent student will have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a number of years.  The system presumes on a level of parental support for students going to college.  If students were allowed to be assessed on their own means simply on the basis of moving out of home, significant additional numbers would be likely to qualify.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be untenable to have a situation whereby all students could simply move out of their parental home and be deemed to be independent for grants purposes.  This could have very significant implications for the student grants budget and could further disadvantage those who need the grant most.</p>

            <p eId="para_6457">According to my Department's records there are currently 62 prefabricated buildings being rented by schools in Limerick City and County at a cost of €673,405.  A single prefabricated unit can often be made up of more than one classroom and include some ancillary accommodation.  Following an analysis of costs by my Department, it is now the policy to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need is likely to last for more than three years.  This will reduce the incidence of long- term rental of prefabricated classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6458">Separately, my Department has commenced a review of this area and has engaged a firm of Chartered Quantity Surveyors to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  This firm of specialists has commenced its work in conjunction with the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The review will involve new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances.  The review will also involve an assessment of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.  The projected rental costs for prefabs for schools in Limerick City and County cannot be projected until my Department considers and implements the recommendations of this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_6459">In the meantime, where the Department has given approval to a school to rent temporary accommodation, the school authorities must seek competitive quotes from suppliers.  This will allow schools to take advantage of the best value available in the current market.</p>

A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The school in question did not apply for a review.</p>

            <p eId="para_6486">I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. However, there is a requirement to make appropriate use of the resources available and along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is dependent on the resources available to the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_6577">I propose to take Questions Nos. 675, 677, 734 and 738 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6578">The school to which the Deputies refer commenced operation with provisional recognition from my Department in September 2007.  It has a current enrolment of 21 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_6579">When granting provisional recognition, the school was informed by my Department that the provision of accommodation was the responsibility of the school Patron. My Department grant aids the rental of such accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6580">My Department approved a rental arrangement for the school, which facilitated it to secure its current accommodation until the end of the 2009/2010 school year.  It was of the understanding that a lease had been executed to achieve this until it was recently informed by the school authority that it would be necessary for it to vacate the premises after Easter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6581">My Department made enquiries locally and sourced alternative accommodation to meet the school's needs.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the school resolved the issues with its landlord and the accommodation it occupied continues to be available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_6582">The school has submitted proposals for alternative accommodation for the  2009/2010 school year, which will substantially increase the level of funding already approved for its accommodation.  This matter is under consideration in the context of the level of the school's accommodation needs and competing demands on the resources of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6586">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6587">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6588">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6589">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_6590">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.  The application form for appeal is also available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

Two third level projects, the National Maritime College Cork completed in 2003 and the Cork School of Music completed in 2007 are now operational.  In addition the contract for the first bundle of post primary schools which includes Coláiste na Sionna, Banagher and Gallen Community School, Ferbane, both Co Offaly and Scoil Chríost Rí, Portlaoise and St Mary's CBS, Portlaoise, Co. Laois, was  signed by the National Development Finance Agency in March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6601">This bundle is part of an on going programme of Public Private Partnership projects and as the financial details associated with this contract are viewed as commercially sensitive I am not in a position to release this information to the Deputy.  Each of these contracts are for 25 years from the date the facilities became operational.  The site and buildings remain in State ownership at all times with the PPP Company being granted a licence to build the facilities and maintain and operate them for the 25 years contract period.</p>
            <p eId="para_6602">The level of Unitary Payment for the two third level projects in 2008 were National Maritime College €8.8m and the Cork School of Music €8.2m.</p>

            <p eId="para_6661">As I have explained to the Deputy in previous replies to Dáil Questions, following an analysis of costs by my Department, it is now the policy to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need is likely to last for more than three years.  This applies to new applications for temporary accommodation.  This will reduce the incidence of long- term rental of prefabricated classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6662">With regard to rented temporary accommodation already in place in schools, my Department has commenced a review of this area and has engaged a firm of chartered quantity surveyors to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work on this has commenced, in close co-operation with the planning and building unit of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6663">The review will involve new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances.  The review will also involve an assessment of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a substantial amount of work involved in this approach.  However, I have asked my Department to give this work priority and it is envisaged that it will be completed before the end of this year.  As soon as the report is available the issue of the buy-out of existing rented accommodation in place for three years or more will be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6664">In the meantime, where the Department has given approval to a school to rent temporary accommodation, the school authorities must seek competitive quotes from suppliers.  This will allow schools to take advantage of the best value available in the current market.</p>

            <p eId="para_6666">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_6667">A revised syllabus in physical education as a non examinable subject at junior cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005.  No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_6668">This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6669">A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_6670">So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 41 participating countries in being physically active for at least four hours per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_6676">It is intended that Project Maths will be an important priority in relation to the overall call on resources in the education sector.  Teachers will be fully supported to implement the reforms in Mathematics in second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_6677">The Project Maths initiative is designed to encourage better understanding of Maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle.  The initiative started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010/11 in all schools, prefaced by a national programme of professional development for teachers beginning in 2009/10 which will continue to at least 2013.  Phase 3 will have begun in all schools in 2012, and will be fully implemented in all class groups by 2015.</p>

A Maths Support Team has been appointed and is currently supporting the project schools, as well as preparing for mainstream in-service development which will start in September 2009, followed by mainstream implementation starting in Sept 2010.  The provision of the Support Team on the scale necessary for mainstream implementation has been prioritised within the overall number of posts available in the education sector.  Some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009 alone, and investment in professional development for teachers will continue in a rolling programme of reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_6680">Dance is included in the strands in the Physical Education curriculum in primary and post primary schools.  In addition, students may choose Dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA).  The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of 4 credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the Dance component.  The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to Post Leaving Certificate courses and from there to higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_6681">My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage, inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance learning.  Within that context, investment in mainstreaming of dance education as a subject for points for the purpose of third level entry is not a priority at the current time.</p>

            <p eId="para_6692">Details of uncertified sick leave for 2007, 2008 and 2009 as requested by the Deputy are contained in the tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_6693">The Department of Finance circular 25/78 governs the conditions that apply to sick leave for officials within the Civil Service.  Under the conditions an official can at most take 7 uncertified sick days with pay within a 12 month period. However, my Department has a policy that in the event an official incurs 5 days uncertified, that a letter issues to the person concerned and reminds them of the conditions governing sick leave and the implications it can have in relation to the award of salary increments and promotion.  As such, it is not possible for an official to take 10 or more uncertified sick days as mentioned in the Deputy's question and in the event it were to arise salary would be deducted from the official concerned for the days in excess of the 7 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_6694">Where an official has a pattern of availing of 7 uncertified sick days regularly over a 4 year period, the Personnel Officer at the Department can modify or withdraw the concession of uncertified sick leave to the official concerned. No cases were referred by my Department to an independent doctor or the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service in 2007, 2008 and 2009 in respect of uncertified sick leave. However, I would like to point out that the C.M.O. has advised that where a Department is concerned about a member of staff taking uncertified sick repeatedly, it should first be addressed through internal management procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_6695">In relation to the Deputy's request for details of staff taking sick leave on a Monday or Friday the system that records officials' sick leave details cannot readily identify this data and it would take an inordinate amount of official time to compile the information.</p>

            <p eId="para_6730">I propose to take Questions Nos. 719 and 723 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6731">The 2009 provision for the 1,500 additional PLC places is €4 million.  The estimated full year cost in 2010 is €12 million. Currently, there are 30,188 PLC places available in some 195 approved schools and centres nationwide.  PLC courses are provided predominantly in the VEC sector, but some community and comprehensive schools and secondary schools also provide courses. PLC courses are full-time and generally of one year's duration.  PLC courses cater for school leavers and adults who want to return to education, including those who are unemployed and those at risk of becoming unemployed.  They are designed to provide successful participants with specific vocational skills to enhance their prospects of securing lasting, full-time employment, or progression to other studies.  A priority for this Government is to support those who have lost their jobs through retraining and further education and I know in this context that individual VECs will be conscious of the need to adjust provision to meet these priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6732">My Department allocates PLC places to VECs and other providers on an annual basis following an application process.  Each application is examined by my Department on its merits, taking into account current and previous allocations, current and previous demand and uptake and the overall number of places available.  Regard is also had in this context to ensuring appropriate provision  on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.  In addition, providers must demonstrate a labour market justification for the courses being proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6733">The application process for the 2009/2010 academic year concluded recently. No decision has been made yet with regard to the allocation of the additional 1,500 places but any allocations would be considered in light of the factors set out above.  To enrol on a PLC course, people should contact their local VEC or PLC provider.</p>

            <p eId="para_6738">I propose to take Questions Nos. 720 to 722, inclusive, and 740 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6739">The table below summarises the almost 7,000 new places on education courses that were announced as part of the Supplementary Budget. This includes an additional 1,500 PLC places in the Further Education Sector and 5,410 places in the Higher Education Sector.  The position in relation to the allocation of the 1,500 PLC places is set out in my reply to Questions 15807 and 15811.</p>
            <p eId="para_6740">In the Higher Education Sector, it is expected that at least 2,000 unemployed people will be accommodated on full time third level courses starting this autumn.  Admission to full time undergraduate courses is primarily through the CAO but there are also opportunities for direct entry through individual institutions' admission offices.  These 2,000 places will be funded from within overall existing resources.  In addition, 1,500 places will be provided to enable persons who are unemployed to pursue third level certificate or degree programmes on a part time basis.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide funding of €4m to support this initiative and arrangements for the operation of the programme are being developed jointly by officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to implementation from September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6741">Following a review by the Institutes of Technology of the scope to utilise vacant capacity, to provide up-skilling for unemployed people, 280 places were made available on a direct entry basis to a range of newly developed accelerated Level 6 Certificate programmes commencing between February and April this year. Under this initiative unemployed persons were offered the opportunity to complete the first year of a standard two year programme in an accelerated manner so that they can move to the second year of the programme in September 2009.  The majority of these courses are of 15 weeks' duration with exams being held over 1/2 weeks.  These programmes are currently running in the Institutes of Technology in Athlone, Carlow, Letterkenny and Sligo.  The cost of the programmes are being met from within existing resources and there is no charge to participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6742">Institutes of Technology are also utilising spare capacity to provide over 900 places on a range of newly developed part time transition programmes.  These programmes have been developed to assist unemployed people who may be some time out of the formal education system to find out more about the type of third level courses that may be suited to them and to build their confidence to return to education by developing some of the necessary skills for studying at third level.  Courses are free of charge to participants.  It is hoped that a significant number of participants on these courses will be encouraged to apply on a direct entry basis for a range of third level certificate and degree programmes commencing in September 2009.  The programmes are being run on a part-time basis, with participants remaining available for opportunities to re-enter employment.  The courses are being delivered over a period of 10 to 15 weeks with participants committed to between 6 and 10 contact hours per week. These programmes are currently running in the Institutes of Technology in Blanchardstown, Carlow, Cork, Dún Laoghaire, Galway-Mayo, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tallaght, Tralee and in DIT.</p>
            <p eId="para_6743">The accelerated programmes and third level transition courses are targeted specifically at unemployed persons.  The Institutes have worked closely with local FÁS and Department of Social and Family Affairs offices both in terms of marketing the courses and advising participants of their entitlements in relation to social welfare payments.  Further information on these programmes is also available directly from the participating Institutes.  Up to 700 additional training places are also being provided for redundant apprentices under a new Redundant Apprentice Institute of Technology Training Scheme.  The purpose of this initiative is to provide an opportunity to redundant apprentices who cannot otherwise secure the job placements required in order to complete their normal apprenticeship programme, to acquire additional certified skills in the education sector.  Further details on this training programme are provided in my response to Question No. 15812.</p>
            <p eId="para_6744">The scope to further develop these initiatives and to identify other appropriate responses which the third level sector can make to support the up-skilling of unemployed people is being examined by a Higher Education Labour Market Response Group which I have asked the HEA to establish.  The core membership of this Group includes representatives of the third level sector, my own Department, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, Forfas and the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  This Group will also provide a structure for engagement with other education and training providers in order to foster collaboration and ensure the optimal return from State resources in meeting the skills needs of the workforce.  I have asked the  Group to provide me with a report on its work by the end of June.</p>

            <p eId="para_6770">The new Redundant Apprentice IoT training scheme announced in the supplementary Budget is an initiative to provide an opportunity to redundant apprentices who cannot otherwise secure the job placements required in order to complete their normal apprenticeship programme, to acquire additional certified skills in the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6771">The curriculum for the programme is being developed by Limerick Institute of Technology on behalf of all of the Institutes of Technology in collaboration with FÁS, the HEA and FETAC.  The programme will focus on developing core skills in maths, ICT and business skills in order to facilitate students progressing to other higher education programmes or to completing their apprenticeship at a later stage.  Students will take six modules totalling 30 credits over an 11 week period on a full time basis and will receive an award at FETAC level 5.</p>
            <p eId="para_6772">The programme which will commence on a pilot basis in September 2009 will be administered by participating Institutes and will be targeted at apprentices who have been made redundant before being able to complete the on-the-job training required at phase 5 of their apprenticeship.  When the arrangements for the operation of the programme are finalised FÁS and the Institutes of Technology will ensure that all potential applicants are provided with details on where the programme will be available and how to apply for admission to the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6773">No fees will be payable by participants.  The cost of the training programme will be met from within existing Department of Education and Science resources through utilising capacity that will become available in the Institutes of Technology due to the fall off in recruitment of apprentices generally. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will fund the payment of a training allowance to participants in lieu of income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_6775">My Department awards contracts for the construction of school buildings in line with national and European public procurement regulations. The management of the Apprenticeship Training Scheme is the responsibility of FÁS which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is my understanding that an employer must be approved and registered by FÁS before they can recruit an apprentice.</p>
            <p eId="para_6776">I understand that FÁS is taking a number of measures to assist apprentices who have been made redundant secure the relevant on the job training phases necessary to complete their apprenticeship. One such initiative that has been put in place is the Employer Based Redundant Apprenticeship Rotation Scheme which was announced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in December 2008.  Under this scheme eligible employers are being supported by FÁS to provide workplace training and assessment for apprentices who have been made redundant. Employers who have vacancies for apprentices are encouraged to post the vacancy on the FÁS Jobs Bank. Redundant apprentices who register with Employment Services are referred to the open vacancies.</p>

            <p eId="para_6782">I propose to take Questions Nos. 727 and 728 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6783">As the Deputy is aware, the scale of the economic downturn has made it necessary to adjust funding provisions across all Departments. The adjustments in the recent budget at third level were part of this overall contribution to public expenditure reductions.   Such adjustments must be viewed however in the context of overall investments in higher education in recent years which has increased from some €1.5 billion in 2004 to over €2 billion this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6784">In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector.  Our higher education system relies disproportionately on Exchequer sources of funding and it is appropriate to look to wider means of meeting future additional resource requirements having particular regard to the difficult budgetary and economic climate that is in prospect in the medium term.   As the Deputy is aware I am currently finalising a review of policy options in relation to the consideration of the introduction  of a form of student contribution.  There are many complex and competing considerations including the funding matters referred to by the Deputy which need to be taken into account in the consideration of all available options.  It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in the near future in relation to such options.</p>

            <p eId="para_6786">The Fuel Duty Rebate Scheme (Provisions of Section 99 (1) Finance Act, 1999) allowed for a rebate in respect of the excise duty paid on fuel used by private contractors on delivering school transport services. This scheme which was processed by the Revenue Commissioners, ceased on 31st October 2008 in accordance with the EU Energy Tax Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6787">The proposed compensatory allowance had not come into operation since the fuel rebate scheme ceased. Provision of €2million had been made in the 2009 Estimate to meet the estimated cost of the compensatory allowance. The school transport estimate has now been reduced, however, by €2 million to €192 million in the supplementary budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6788">Bus Éireann was informed on 7th April that due to the very difficult fiscal conditions, it is not possible for the Department to approve any increase towards compensating private operators on contract to Bus Éireann for any loss of income arising from the termination of the fuel rebate scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6793">The duties which may be delegated to post of responsibility holders at primary level are outlined in Department Primary Circular 07/03 (Appendix A). At Post-primary level the relevant circulars are 4/98 Deputy Principals, 05/98 Voluntary Secondary Schools, 20/98 VECs, 23/98 C&amp;C schools, 46/00 Adult Education and PPT17/02 Programme Co-ordinator. All of the circulars are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_6794">Following the Government decision on the moratorium on promotions in the Public Service my Department issued a circular to all schools indicating that with effect from 27 March, 2009 schools may no longer make any appointment to a post of responsibility including those that may have fallen vacant on or before 27 March, 2009. This Circular 0022/2009 is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_6795">It is a matter for the school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing this moratorium.   Under the revised arrangements schools may continue to fill posts of Principal and Deputy Principal. The Government decision provides for an exception in respect of the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools. My Department will be in direct communication with new schools in relation to their entitlements to fill their first allocation of posts of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_6796">It is not possible at this stage to indicate the precise level of vacancies that may arise over the next two years however it is expected that a saving of  €5m will accrue from the introduction of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in schools and the review of special needs assistants now  under way.  The National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. The SENOs convey such decisions directly to schools.   The criteria for allocating special needs assistant support for children with special educational needs were not changed as part of the budget announcements. The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>

            <p eId="para_6798">A letter of intent issued to the main contractor on 9 April 2009, requesting sight of certain important documents and confirmation of a number of other issues.  Once all the documentation requested has been received and meets my Department's requirements, a formal letter of acceptance will issue to the Contractor.  It is estimated that it will take 12 to 15 months to complete the project, from the date of commencement on site.</p>

            <p eId="para_6800">I assume the Deputy is referring to an application from the school in question for the provision of additional accommodation under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme. As part of the expansion of that scheme a grant was sanctioned in 2007 to enable the school authority to build one permanent classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_6801">An application by the school for further additional funding was received by my Department in late 2008, however, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of the Department it was not possible to provide extra funding at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6802">The application for an increase in the grant amount is being reviewed by my Department in the context of the 2009 Building Programme and the management will be informed of the position in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_6804">The Deputy is referring to the amalgamation of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC). The new organisation will also take responsibility for the external quality assurance review of the universities, a function which is currently performed by the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB) and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). The statement also refers to the possibility of including some of the  related functions of the National University of Ireland in the new organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6805">An Implementation Advisory Group (IAG), comprising representatives of the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC, the HEA, the IUQB and the Irish Universities Association has been formed to advise my Department on the implementation of the amalgamation.  My Department has had separate discussions with NUI.</p>
            <p eId="para_6806">A consultation paper has been prepared, with the assistance of the IAG, covering the functions and shape of the new organisation and key legislative considerations.  A period of public consultation is planned, which is due to start shortly and will conclude in June.  My Department has also started work on the legislation necessary for the amalgamation.  The target completion date for the legislative process is Autumn 2010, with the new statutory organisation to be established in Winter 2010/Spring 2011.</p>

          if he will reconsider the cap on student numbers in post leaving certificate courses; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a college (details supplied) in Dublin 10 risks losing seven teachers once this cap is enforced which would mean a reduction in the number of potential students being accepted to study at the college; if he will review the number of places open to students in PLC colleges in view of the rapid growth of unemployment here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6808">From September 2009, an additional 1,500 Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places will be made available nationwide.  This will bring the total number of approved PLC places to 31,688.</p>
            <p eId="para_6809">The PLC programme provides successful participants with specific vocational skills to enhance their prospects of securing lasting, full-time employment, or progression to other studies.  The allocation of these extra 1,500 PLC places is another step in expanding opportunities and broadening access to further education so that people can enhance their employment skills.  The College referred to by the Deputy is part of City of Dublin VEC.  Places are allocated to VECs an on annual basis following an application process. The further distribution of places to individual colleges within VECs is a matter  for each VEC.</p>

            <p eId="para_6815">The criteria for allocating resource teaching support for pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with Down Syndrome, did not change as part of the recent budget announcements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6816">Primary school pupils with high incidence special educational needs may receive additional teaching support under the terms of the General Allocation System. One of the benefits of the General Allocation System is that it has put teaching resources in place in schools on a more systematic basis. This facilitates flexible and early intervention and gives schools more certainty about their resource levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_6817">Post-primary schools which have students with special educational needs, and primary schools which have enrolled pupils with low incidence special educational needs, may apply to the National Council for Special Education for additional allocations of resource teaching support.  The number of additional teaching hours allocated is dependent on the pupil's special educational needs.  I wish to reiterate that pupils with special educational needs including those with Down Syndrome have, and will continue to have, access to additional teaching resources to support their education. However, there is a requirement to make appropriate use of the resources available and along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is dependent on the resources available to the Government.</p>
