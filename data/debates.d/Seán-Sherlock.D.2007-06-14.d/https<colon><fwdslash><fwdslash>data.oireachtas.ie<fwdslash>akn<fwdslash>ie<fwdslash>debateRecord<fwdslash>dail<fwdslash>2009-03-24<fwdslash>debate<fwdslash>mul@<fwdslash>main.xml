            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_9">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I attended the twelfth summit of the British Irish Council in Cardiff, Wales on  20 February last.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cúiv.  The meeting was hosted by the First Minister for Wales, Rhodri Morgan, and brought together representatives of all eight member administrations.  The Northern Ireland delegation was led by First Minister, Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">The summit began with a discussion on the current economic situation, with a sharing of views on efforts to assist those facing unemployment and on providing support for businesses.  Other issues discussed included social inclusion initiatives, energy, initiatives to address the misuse of drugs, the promotion of minority and lesser used languages and early years education.  The Council also agreed to adopt four new strategic work areas: energy, digital inclusion, housing and collaborative spatial planning.   It also discussed the progress made on the establishment of a standing secretariat and looked forward to bringing this to a conclusion at the next British Irish Council summit in Jersey in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">I am glad the House had an opportunity the week before last to express its views on the terrible atrocities that had been perpetrated in Northern Ireland.  Together with all other democratic representatives on these islands, the Members of this House have made clear their unity of purpose in resisting and dealing with the unrepresentative criminal groups that carried out those atrocities.  In the course of that debate, I spoke about my discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, whom I met again at last week's meeting of the European Council.  Like the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, the Prime Minister and I are determined that these groups will not succeed — everything possible will be done to bring them to justice.  I have met a Sinn Féin delegation, led by the President of that party, Mr. Gerry Adams, since then.  At that meeting, on 12 March, we discussed the recent attacks and the collective response of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish and British Governments.  I met the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Robinson, the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, and various other Northern Ireland party leaders during my visit to the United States for St Patrick's Day.  During that trip, the US President, Mr. Barack Obama, delivered a powerful message of support for the people of Northern Ireland, their democratic institutions and their public representatives.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_13">Two matters arise from the Taoiseach's reply.  First, the Taoiseach referred to the discussions on the proposed arrangements for the establishment of a permanent secretariat of the British-Irish Council.  Where is it intended that such a secretariat will be located?  What is the estimated cost to the Exchequer of the establishment of such a secretariat?</p>
            <p eId="para_14">Second, the Taoiseach mentioned the atrocities that occurred in Northern Ireland a couple of weeks ago.  I agree that the unity of reaction that was evident during the discussion in this House was remarkable.  Such unity of purpose was also a feature of the Northern Ireland parties' responses to the two atrocities.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House anything further about the information available to him on the extent of the possible threat from dissident republican organisations?  What is the extent of the connection between such organisations and organised gun crime, for example in this State?  To what extent do dissident republicans have connections with criminal gangs?  Is the kind of information that led Sir Hugh Orde to issue a warning before the recent atrocities available to the Garda Síochána?  Before the atrocities occurred in Northern Ireland earlier this month, Sir Hugh Orde had warned that dissident groups were active again and were likely to do serious damage.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the groups have acquired additional bomb-making capabilities in recent times?  Have they armed themselves with additional equipment?  What is the assessment of their potential threat to political institutions and, more particularly, the security forces in the North and the South?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_15">I can inform Deputy Gilmore, in response to his first question, that a decision on the possible establishment of a standing secretariat, which has been on the agenda for some time, will be made next October.  A number of jurisdictions have indicated an interest in providing the location of the secretariat.  We have kept out of that to give a number of other countries an opportunity to follow up their interest in housing the standing secretariat.  The Northern Ireland Executive, like its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Jersey, has indicated an interest in providing a location.  I am sure all of them would prove suitable, in their own way.  All parties accept that there is a need to find consensus on this.  The necessity to come to a decision has been agreed.  No decision has been made on where it will be located.  It is a matter for the various applicants that have indicated their interest to discuss the issue between now and next October, to see what the final outcome will be.  It is felt that a decision, one way or the other, should be made next October.  We will have to wait and see what the outcome will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">On North-South issues and the recent atrocities and the consequences in so far as we can gauge them, the Garda has been keeping close surveillance on, and has been monitoring, dissident activity for some time with a fair degree of success.  People will recall on numerous occasions over the past number of years the Garda's ability to intercept and intervene in what could have developed into full-scale operations directed into Northern Ireland.  That level of success is a reflection of both the professionalism of the security services in this jurisdiction and also the level of co-operation taking place between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">The Garda Commissioner has spoken, not in the immediate recent past but from time to time, about the continuing threat of dissident activity and the need to monitor and conduct surveillance on those individuals.  In many respects, such is the nature of terrorism and I do not think there is a capacity to sustain a campaign of the type we saw in the past from these groups.  However, clearly these are factions which would have the capacity, and have demonstrated their intention in the past, even if intercepted, to conduct incidents here that would be a major threat to life and limb for anyone in the proximity of attempts, for example, to transport bomb material or to locate bombs in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">Unfortunately, despite the fact that they have no mandate whatever and no support, these small factions seem intent on trying to continue to create mayhem and to commit murder where they can.  Obviously, our security services are doing everything they can to prevent that happening.  As I stated, a number of incidents have been brought to public attention as a result of various surveillance operations undertaken by the Garda.  Many of them in jail and others may be charged.  There is also an investigation taking place presently in respect of the recent atrocities and I understand a 17 year old has been charged with the murder of the policeman.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">I do not have any other information beyond what I know to be the case from security committee briefings in recent times, that is, that the Garda Síochána is fully <i>au fait</i> with the need to deploy all and any resources and it has indicated that those resources are available to it to conduct the necessary surveillance and monitoring that it does on an ongoing daily basis to ensure that these people do not succeed in the terms in which they regard as success.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_20">What is the Taoiseach's understanding of the timetable for the devolution of justice and policing powers to Northern Ireland?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_21">As Deputy Gilmore will be aware, progress continues to be made on this matter and the passage of the necessary legislation at Westminster two weeks ago was an important step in this regard.  It is also important that all the political parties continue to engage proactively through the Assembly committee to move the issue forward, and that is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">Both the Irish and British Governments remain fully committed to seeing the devolution of policing and justice brought to a conclusion.  As I said, it is a matter of continuing discussion between the parties directly and I welcome the fact that they have found a means to do that.  I believe it is important that the transfer of policing and devolution continues as envisaged and takes place as quickly as possible so that the people of Northern Ireland will know that this issue is being addressed by the people who are best capable of doing so, that is, the local representatives themselves.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_23">I note that a teenager has been charged with the murder of the late Constable Stephen Carroll.  When I was in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday I took the opportunity to brief the EPP members on the necessity for continued demonstration of support and solidarity from the European Union regarding the situation in Northern Ireland.  At Thursday's meeting of the Heads of Government, did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to brief his fellow leaders on the situation and strongly stress the point that this country has always appreciated American and European Union support and that this should not be allowed to flag under any circumstances?</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Has the Taoiseach or Government received any information from Garda information sources on one of these dissident groups having what is described as a very large bomb for use on the British mainland?  Has the Taoiseach received any evidence that this is anything other than an allegation or rumour?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_25">I have no such information but if I had, as the Deputy will be aware, it is not something I would bring into the public domain anyway.  I did not raise the other matter formally at the European Council meeting.  Colleagues are aware of the close co-operation between us and the British Government on this matter at governmental level.  We have maintained contact at that level.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_26">We have raised these questions here on a number of occasions in the past number of months.  The PSNI was concerned at the increasing threat from dissident groups in Northern Ireland, which resulted in the Chief Constable calling in specialist intelligence units from Great Britain.  In the briefings the Garda has given him over the past number of months was there any evidence of activity or was concern expressed by the Garda information units that this might become a reality?</p>
            <p eId="para_27">There are very small numbers involved, but they are people of evil intent.  Does the Taoiseach have any evidence of recruitment going on in particular locations in this jurisdiction?  Is he aware of vulnerable young people being encouraged to join either of these two dissident groups?  Is any evidence available to him from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Garda intelligence sources that this is the case?  Where vulnerable young people might be encouraged, pressurised or forced to join either of these two dissident groups, has the Government any contingency plan to counteract that by pointing out that there is a better way and that the way to achieve political objectives for all who support paramilitaries is through peaceful means and democratic dialogue?  I am sure the Taoiseach shares those sentiments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_28">Part of the security briefings is an update by the heads of security in the country, including the Garda Commissioner, on nefarious activities being sought to be undertaken by these dissident and terrorist groups.  Unfortunately, because of the length of the previous conflict we had, we know the Garda Síochána is very professional and adept at identifying suspects and keeping very close tabs on their activities, the company they keep, the places they go and what they might be up to.  The general stance of our security services, despite the success of the peace process, has always been a vigilant one.  The gardaí, knowing members of their force have paid the ultimate price in trying to deal with this threat in the past, need no reminding from me or anybody that constant vigilance is the norm in trying to deal with these individuals.  One never underestimates, despite their small number, their capacity to cause mayhem, destruction and loss of life and the evil intent that motivates their activities in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">Second, regarding the effort to recruit, I am sure these individuals try to see if they can inveigle people to join them in their criminal conspiracies but I understand the numbers involved are small.  It is not a numbers game but a small number of people can do a great deal of harm, depending on the depth of evil in their intent and their capacity to execute it.  It is a question of constant vigilance, full deployment of all necessary resources, building on the expertise in the Garda over many years — a record of many successful interventions, which have stopped operations and actions taking place that would have put many people at risk — and a common determination now with the PSNI to ensure those responsible for the most recent acts of terror are identified, brought before the courts and prosecuted.  The rule of law in our democratic society will ensure justice prevails.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_30">Does the Taoiseach agree the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to the executive in Belfast is absolutely essential and a vital element in the delivery of the full content and intent of the Good Friday Agreement?  Has he noted the policing Bill passed through its last Stage in the British Parliament on 11 March, the required order-in-council was laid before it on 19 March and this is due to come into effect on 10 April?  Does he understand, as I do, the next stage is for the Assembly and the executive review committee to address how the transfer will take place?  Can he outline the role of the Government in these developments I have indicated?  Will he join me in welcoming the progress made, albeit long overdue, and in encouraging all involved in moving the project of the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast at the earliest opportunity?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_31">The Government has noted these legislative developments and it is aware of the procedural steps that have been taken.  We welcome the fact that the orders-in-council reflect the legislation and enable the intention of all the parties to proceed on the basis of the agreement reached.  It is important we proceed consistent with the agreements reached at political level in order that the devolution of justice and policing powers takes place as expeditiously as possible, consistent with those agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">With regard to the Government's participation, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, and his deputy, Mr. Paul Goggins.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has met the Secretary of State since and he expressed the Government's view that, to move forward, the devolution of policing and justice powers should take place as soon as possible consistent with the procedures and discussions envisaged since the legislation was passed in Westminster.</p>

Ní raibh an Taoiseach ábalta a rá go raibh seans aige ceist an chlaonpháirteachais a phlé le Príomh-Aire an Breataine go dtí seo.  An raibh an t-ábhar sin á phlé aige ón chéad lá dheireanach a raibh na ceisteanna seo á bplé againn sa Teach anseo?</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Has the Taoiseach yet had the opportunity to raise with the British Prime Minister the communications forwarded by the Houses of the Oireachtas to our counterparts in the British Parliament, concerning the agreed motion, supported by all elected voices in these Houses, calling on our counterparts in the British Parliament in Westminster to address the serious matters of collusion?  Has he had the opportunity since the last occasion we addressed these questions in this Chamber to raise this matter and was the issue of progress towards the transfer of policing and justice addressed too?</p>
            <p eId="para_35">I hope the Taoiseach accepts that I hold no brief for those responsible for the recent atrocities in Antrim and Craigavon.  My condemnation of these actions was, and remains, as strong as that of any other voice in this Chamber.  Has the Taoiseach noted the concerns of human rights groups, which have long-standing credibility on this island and elsewhere, at the continuing renewal of detention of individuals brought in for questioning on these matters?  Does the Taoiseach share the legitimate concern at the prospect of people being detained for questioning over long periods, and up to four weeks?  Has he considered the expressions of concern reported on "Morning Ireland" this morning on RTE?  Would the Taoiseach and Ministers use any opportunity they might have to reflect the human rights concerns of many about protracted questioning and all that entails?  We want to see speedy movement towards charging those responsible for these actions, and due process taking its course.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">Nuair a bhí mé ag labhairt le Príomh-Aire na Breataine, níor shíl mé go raibh sé oiriúnach na hábhair a luaigh an Teachta a thabhairt suas leis mar bhí mé ag tabhairt bá an náisiúin do phobal na Breataine mar gheall ar na dúnmharuithe a tharla in Aontroim agus i gCraigavon.  Bhí mé ag rá leis an Phríomh-Aire go bhfuil sé riachtanach go bhfuil comhoibriú idir na Rialtais chomh láidir agus is féidir go mbeimid in ann na daoine atá ciontach as seo a thabhairt os comhair na cúirte chomh luath agus is féidir.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">I did not raise the issue of collusion with the British Prime Minister on the occasion of my discussions with him because I was expressing the sympathy of the Irish people with the families of those who had been murdered.  An bhéim a bhí agam sa chomhrá ná go bhfuilimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall chomhoibriú leis na forsaí póilíneachta sa Tuaisceart go mbeimid in ann na daoine a bhí ciontach a thabhairt os comhair na cúirte.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">It was important to indicate the strong determination of all democrats in Ireland to ensure that those who were responsible for these atrocious murders would be brought to justice as quickly as possible and to assure him of the full co-operation of our security services in that effort.  It was also important to say that the politics should remain in the ascendant and that we continue to pursue political progress as a confirmation to people throughout the island of Ireland that the peace process would not be derailed by such an unrepresentative group of people engaged in criminal activity. That was the context in which the contact was made and maintained during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">Regarding the other matter the Deputy raised, the British criminal justice system has rights of detention that were brought forward by legislative enactment in recent years in the House of Commons.  This was mainly because of acts of Islamist terrorism which caused huge loss of life in London, and on another occasion when it was clear that the basic security of the British people was being put at risk by acts of terrorism about which nobody has notice.  As the British Government saw it, there was, therefore, a democratic wish to improve legislation.  The need to detain those who would be held as suspects for such atrocious crimes was seen to be increased and the British made their decisions in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">It is important to point out that in any democracy the right is available to any accused person to use the independent legal system for the purpose of reviewing the legality of his or her detention.  I believe the reforms we have seen in Northern Ireland in both policing and justice are such that one can expect, with confidence, that those issues will be dealt with before the courts in a way consistent with the rule of law.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_41">I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that many Members of this House, including myself, are members of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, formerly the British Irish Interparliamentary Body.  That body does good work in trying to pursue a number of the issues in which the British Irish Council is involved.  Does the Taoiseach consider as useful the suggestion that we might have a debate after Council meetings at which he, as Head of Government represents our country?  Such a debate could be similar in format to those that follow a short period after EU summit meetings.  In that way, issues such as the mutual recognition of penalty points and other issues that need to be dealt with on an east-west and North-South basis could be examined.  Would the Taoiseach consider that suggestion?</p>
            <p eId="para_42">Does the Taoiseach agree with me that one of the great successes in the immediate aftermath of the Omagh atrocity was that our security forces and those north of the Border  had the capacity to sit on these people and to close them down?  Many of them were known to security forces and are now in prison.  The problem that has emerged since is that a younger, more vicious and unknown group has effectively taken over positions within these organisations.  We have been very lucky to date.  I cite the example of Castlewellan where mass murder was averted by superb intelligence and interception on the part of both security forces.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the position now needs to be severely examined in terms of ramping up the work, the resources and the co-operation? I accept that these are already at a very heightened level and that must continue apace.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">I am loath to ask the following question because I believe I know the answer but it would be useful to have it put on the record.  Is it the case that there are no circumstances whereby any formal, informal, backchat or back-channel discussions could occur during the next while with these two organisations, or with other self-styled republican groups, as a means of trying to understand what they are doing?  I am sure that the Taoiseach speaks for us when he says these are criminal organisations and that no effort will be made to to have discussions with them, formal or informal.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_15">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_44">With regard to the first matter Deputy Hayes raised, namely, the British Irish Council, issues arising from its meetings are dealt with through parliamentary questions, as now.  Members may be of the opinion that a formal debate from time to time would help to improve the visibility of that work or perhaps a more structured approach within the committee system.  There are a number of options which the Whips could consider to see how we could keep the agenda active.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">I welcome the widest possible participation by the Oireachtas in these matters because they are an important part of the architecture of the Agreement.  It is important that everybody gives them the attention they deserve and that we are seen to be participants in all aspects of the work of the institutions in so far as it refers and relates to us and that we are not selective in any way.  These are matters that can be considered in due course in terms of what is the best way to go about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">On the second issue raised by the Deputy, I do not think it is right to say that a new, young leadership has taken over these factions and that they are any more determined than those who preceded them.  In the main, those active in these organisations are people who would have knowledge of terrorist activity in the past.  While they have broken away from other organisations at various times and it is obvious that recruitment efforts are being made and some people may well be inveigled into joining such organisations now in an effort to find people who do not have a previous record — I will not put it stronger than that — because this might be beneficial to them in their efforts to maintain activity of this kind, the leadership or the direction of these organisations remain in the hands of those who have had experience in this matter in the past.  This is my considered view in so far as I am aware of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">We only deal with people on the basis of commitment to a process of peace and democracy and the involvement of these people in the activities in which they are engaged is a very clear statement of their evil intent.  The fact that they are not part of this process is obvious for all to see.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I refer to my earlier question about the decision of these Houses and the passing of a unanimous motion in this Chamber on the issue of collusion.  While I accept the Taoiseach's response and his explanation that the last time he met the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was an inappropriate or unsuitable opportunity to raise that specific matter because it was particular to one purpose in the conveying of sympathy in the context of the recent murders in Antrim and Armagh, will he not accept that there has been an inordinate delay in the unanimous decision of this House being properly responded to by the British Government, by the British Parliament, and that an acknowledgment from the Clerk of the Dáil's counterpart in Westminster is not a response that we would have envisaged, given the seriousness and the enormity of all involved in the issue that was addressed in this House in a very serious way by Members of all parties and none on that occasion?  Will the Taoiseach accept there is a responsibility on him to seek and secure a specific meeting with the British Prime Minister in order to address these matters with him, so that he may take due ownership and responsibility for having the matters raised by the parties and Independent Members of this House dealt with by his fellow parliamentarians in Westminster?  There needs to be a product, result and action relevant to the importance of the matter concerned, emanating from that body.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">Will the Taoiseach now undertake to act in accordance with the decision of this House and proactively pursue this matter at the earliest opportunity?</p>

As I have said before, I have not had an opportunity to raise such matters with the British Prime Minister to date.  Opportunities may present themselves in the future, where I can do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">All Members of the House are united that the various dissident groups who now appear to be reactivating, should be closed down and put out of business.  One aspect of this, obviously, is their access to weaponry.  What is the Government's assessment or, indeed, that of the Garda as regards the extent of the weaponry available to dissident groups?  Are they still getting weapons from outside the State and are new weapons being assembled?</p>
            <p eId="para_56">To come back to the question I raised earlier about the links between some of these groups and criminal gangs and their connection with the gun crimes and shootings we see in this jurisdiction on a weekly basis, what action is being taken to close down access to weaponry and to stop either dissidents or other criminals from getting their hands on guns?</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_57">I want to ask the Taoiseach a different question.  In his discussions with the First Minister of Northern Ireland, did he deal with the question of cross-Border trade activities?  Does the Taoiseach accept, for instance, the admission of the Minister for Finance that his decision to increase VAT by 0.5% was a mistake, which has had serious implications for retail business 30 miles south of the Border?  In that context, did the Taoiseach discuss with the First Minister of Northern Ireland the situation as regards planning in this jurisdiction where, as he is aware, there is a cap on retail size, while north of the Border there is not?  For instance, in Newry a planning application has been lodged for a 1.5 million sq. ft. facility which will have serious consequences for retailing in Dundalk, Armagh, Monaghan, Enniskillen and Sligo.  Was that an issue discussed by the Taoiseach with the First Minister, in respect of trade on both sides of the Border?</p>
            <p eId="para_58">In view of both the strength and fragility of the tourism industry, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that the tourism bodies, North and South, which co-operate very well, should again adopt, for example, ambassadors for golf, Pádraig Harrington and Rory McIlroy in an all-Ireland sense?  This would have enormous implications for golf tourism throughout the island, with particular reference to links golf from Royal County Down right around to the southern coast.  There is serious potential there in a cross-Border sense.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this with the First Minister?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_24">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_59">In regard to what Deputy Gilmore said, efforts have been made to get weapons in from outside for these groups.  Obviously, the Garda works with Interpol and other international agencies to try to deal with that threat and there have been some successes in that area in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">I have seen reports but I understand from the Garda Commissioner that there is not this cross connection between drugs-gun gangs and these factions and that, in the main, they operate separately and for different purposes.  Again, I have seen reports of that but based on the Garda Commissioner's views, I do not believe it is an accurate assessment of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">On the issue raised by Deputy Kenny, I believe what the Minister for Finance referred to was that having increased VAT by 0.5%, two weeks later the British Government brought down VAT.  Its budget came some weeks after his own but he was not suggesting that, in itself, was the reason for the differential.  We all know the exchange rate is the issue.  Unfortunately, that is something which is not within our control.  We have seen the devaluation of the exchange rate <i>vis-à-vis </i> sterling over the past four months of anything up to 25% to 30%.  That is a real issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">On the question of tourism, I agree we must use every opportunity we can to promote the country.  Many millions of people will come to our shores this year despite it being a difficult one.  I spoke to some tour operators in New York when I was there for St. Patrick's weekend and while obviously the demand is down, it is still reasonably good despite the bad year.  They are working away and hope they will provide some tourists for the country this year.  Many people are still coming, although fewer than last year and the year before.  In historical terms, it is still a fair performance given the times in which we are living.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">On the Irish Open, efforts are being made to see if it is possible to hold it in venues North and South in consecutive years.  Those ideas are being worked on.  As Deputy Kenny said, the golfing ambassadorship issue of Mr. Harrington and Mr. McIlroy would not go astray either.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_25">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_65">We have an unprecedented situation in the dairy sector at present and the outlook for dairy markets in the short term is poor.  Market prices have been adjusting following historically high prices in 2007 and early 2008 and there is the further complication of the credit crunch.  These two factors have put an enormous burden on the sector and we have seen a slump in demand as a consequence.  In Ireland we are entering a period of abundant supplies and the levels at which export refunds and intervention function will be critical to the speed at which the sector emerge from the current difficulties.  I have urged a short sharp utilisation of the market management measures to get the market back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">I have maintained close contact with Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel regarding the need for appropriate action to support the market.  The Commission responded initially with the early introduction of private storage aid for butter and with the reintroduction of export refunds in January.  In addition, the Commissioner gave a commitment to continue intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder under the tendering arrangements once the fixed limits were reached.  These were welcome developments and well judged at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">I met the Commissioner in Brussels on 11 March to discuss developments and to explore the options open to us.  In particular, I had two main issues to press her on.  The first was the need to buy butter into intervention at prices close to the fixed price level.  The second was to stress the need to export larger quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder to international markets.  I am pleased to report very positive progress on both these key points.  At last week's management committee meeting it was agreed to purchase a total of 6,665 tonnes of butter into intervention at levels very close to the intervention price.  This is a very important development.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">In addition to this, increased quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder were granted export refunds at the meeting.  The volumes supported with export refunds last week were almost equivalent to the combined totals of the three previous tenders.  This is a very welcome and needed improvement and should help bring stability to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">At yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers there was a debate about the unprecedented situation at present in the dairy sector and the short term outlook for dairy markets.  I informed my colleagues that in Ireland we are entering a period of abundant supplies and the levels at which refunds and intervention function will be critical to the speed at which we emerge from the current slump.  While I was encouraged by recent developments in community support, I further urged a short, sharp utilisation of the market management measures to get the market back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.  It is clear to me that the elements which will lead this recovery are competitive refunds that allow the sale of dairy products onto world markets in considerable quantities and the continuation of intervention under the tendering mechanism, provided that these arrangements remain relatively attractive.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">The Commission was left in no doubt by myself and by a number of other member states of the importance of fully using all available supports to manage the market in the upcoming period.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_26">
            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_71">There is unanimity on all sides of the House regarding the crisis.  Most people are interested in hearing about what progress is being made to deliver a solution, not just at the farm gate where, at prices of 20 cent a litre, many farmers will milk cows twice daily for no financial return.  Another issue is the processing sector where, in the previous milk year, processors probably subvented the price of milk to the tune of €100 million but are not capable of doing so for a second successive year.  The carnage may not stop at the farm gate.  There is a real danger that there also may be casualties in the processing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">I welcome what the Minister said, up to a point.  Did I understand him correctly when he said an additional 6,665 tonnes of butter could be bought into intervention as a result of last week's agreement?  That is the equivalent of about less than half a day's production.  We need to put that in context.  The original 30,000 tonnes of butter available would be filled in less than two days.  Therefore, 6,000 tonnes is but a drop in the ocean.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Apart from the bilateral meetings which the Minister is having with Commissioner Fischer Boel, what political arrangements is he organising?  What alliances is he forging with other member states who have a similar issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_74">One example is the issue of cheddar cheese and export refunds.  Processors who are dependent on exports of cheddar cheese are finding that export refunds are useless because they are meeting a tariff on the other side which is greater than the refund available to them.  We need to know what political alliances are being forged to deliver meaningful intervention for farmers in order that they get a fair price for their product and ensure that those employed in the processing sector are equally protected.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_27" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_75">We all share the same views outlined by Deputy Creed.  I understand he outlined a similar viewpoint at a previous question time.  There are particular difficulties and we know the price being quoted now by the different co-ops and processors, and the difficulties that poses for farmers.  I know the co-operatives and processors also face difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Regarding the quantity mentioned, to be accurate I wish to put it on the record that at last Thursday's management committee meeting 6,665 tonnes of butter were accepted at a level very close to the intervention price.  This was an extremely positive response.  The overall volume accepted amounted to some 70% of the total offered and the Irish component which was not accepted will be eligible for the next tender.  It is worth putting on the record that in the case of skimmed milk powder and export refunds, 14,663 tonnes were equivalent to the combined volumes of the three previous tenders.  Regarding butter, the total supported was 5,257 tonnes, compared to some 7,000 tonnes for the combined three previous tenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">The general reaction of the operators was favourable to the decisions made at last Thursday's meeting.  The next meeting will take place on Thursday week, where there will be further product moved along.  As we all know, we need to get product out of the market to ensure we get the proper supply.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_78">What most farmers are concerned about is how the Minister's statement will translate into their monthly milk cheque.  At a price of 20 cent a litre, it is a loss-making enterprise for farmers.  Will what the Minister has achieved deliver 26 cent a litre, which is the target figure for profitable milk production?  Anything less than that will not bring any comfort to the dairy sector which for many years has been the real engine of the agri-economy at the farm gate and in the processing sector.  We need to know if the Minister is delivering something tangible or if he is delivering the <i>status quo</i>, which is prices below the cost of production and financial ruin facing farmers and processors.  </p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_79">It is not just now that we recognise the difficulties which will face this sector this year.  We know historically about the welcome increase in prices in 2007 and the early part of 2008 and the subsequent major surge in supply onto the world market.  The dollar, New Zealand currency and other factors all play a role in making it difficult for Europe to sell product.  The prices, as all of us know, are set by the processor and not by the Department.  I began intensively lobbying the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development last November regarding the need to use the market management measures and the aid to private storage was brought forward on 1 January, two months ahead of the normal time.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">I met the Commissioner in the latter months of 2008 to impress upon her the need to make the best and most effective use of the management measures which are in place.</p>

         the measures and guarantees he received from his recent meeting with Commissioner Fisher Boel on the dairy crisis; his strategy to secure support from his fellow agriculture Ministers in Europe for greater levels of support from the EU Commission to stabilise dairy markets and to speed up their recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_82">I met Commissioner Fischer Boel in Brussels on 11 March to discuss the dairy situation and explore the options open to us to restore market confidence.  In particular, I had two main issues to press her on.  The first was the requirement to continue to buy butter into intervention at prices close to the fixed price level.  The second was to stress the need to export larger quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder to international markets.  I am satisfied that we have seen positive progress on both these key points.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">At last week's management committee meeting it was agreed to purchase a total of 6,665 tonnes of butter into intervention at levels very close to the intervention price.  This is a very important development.  In addition to this, increased quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder were granted export refunds at the same meeting.  The volumes supported with export refunds last week were almost equivalent to the combined totals of the three previous tenders.  This is a welcome improvement and should help bring stability to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">I have of course had ongoing contact with the Commissioner long before my meeting on 11 March regarding the need for appropriate action to support the dairy market.  The Commission responded initially with the early introduction of private storage aid for butter and with the reintroduction of export refunds in January.  In addition, the Commissioner gave a commitment to continue intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder under the tendering arrangements once the fixed limits were reached.  These were welcome developments and well judged at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">At yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers there was a debate about the unprecedented situation in the dairy sector at present and the short-term outlook for dairy markets.  I informed my colleagues that we are entering a period of abundant supplies and the levels at which refunds and intervention function will be critical to the speed at which we emerge from the current slump.  While I was encouraged by recent developments in community support, I again took the opportunity to urge the Commission and the Commissioner to utilise the market management measures to get the market back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">It is clear that the elements that will lead this recovery are competitive refunds that allow the sale of dairy products onto world markets in considerable quantities and the continuation of intervention under the tendering mechanism, provided that these arrangements remain relatively attractive.  The Commission was left in no doubt by a number of other member states and myself of the importance of fully using all available supports to manage the market in the coming period.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_87">Given that what the Minister has outlined represents a short-term response, will he indicate whether a long-term response has been discussed?  I ask this question in the context of the announcement by Dairygold, one of the main processors in Munster, that it has had to reduce milk prices by 17.4 cent per litre in the last 12 months.  The price is currently bottoming out at some 20 cent per litre.  The intervention mechanisms to which the Minister referred, such as aid to private storage and export funds, will have a short-term effect in terms of improving price.  Has there been any political discussion on the overall quota regime?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_32" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_88">Some member states raised the possibility of revisiting the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I vehemently oppose such proposals.  Last week I travelled to Germany to meet the German Minister.  Germany has strongly advocated additional support for the dairy sector.  However, it also favours revisiting the health check.  As I said, we strongly oppose that proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">During the course of the health check negotiations, we sought and initiated a debate within the Health Check mechanism to ensure that we retained the market management measures that are currently in place.  If those measures were not in place, the dairy sector would be in serious trouble.  We are all aware of the serious difficulties that exist both at farm gate level and at processor level.  Several member states have indicated that they would like to see the additional quota put on hold.  One member state advocated that the butterfat adjustment should not be implemented.  I disagree entirely with these proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">The Health Check has not led to the deterioration in the dairy market.  The reality is that we are under quota.  There was a welcome increase in prices in 2007 and the early part of 2008 at which time there was a reduced supply from New Zealand as a result of drought.  Since then, however, there has been increased supply from New Zealand and the United States.  In the case of the latter, the weakness of the dollar made for a favourable currency arrangement.  The currency situation has since changed somewhat.  To reiterate, we do not support a revisiting of the Health Check under any circumstances.  We may stand to lose out in a major way from any such review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_33">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_91">Why has the Minister entirely ruled out revisiting the health check?  As he said, we are under quota.  In the current global economic environment, the demand for dairy-based products is reducing significantly over time.  Has there been any political analysis of how that will pan out?  Given our emphasis on milk-based production, there will be serious implications for the agriculture sector if there is no improvement in global demand.  There will be little choice but to revisit the health check because it will have serious implications for how we produce dairy-based products into the future.  I do not see how such a review can be ruled out emphatically without some degree of debate and analysis of where we are going.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_34" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_92">There is a provision in the health check for a review of its measures in 2010.  Some member states have proposed that this review be brought forward to 2009.  As I said, I do not support this proposal.  We must be careful not to send out a message that Europe is chopping and changing policy.  That would lead to instability.  We must look to the situation of the processor or individual farmer who intends to invest and provide additional on-farm facilities.  The political analysis that has been done in regard to the long-term demand for dairy products is favourable.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation has provided detailed analysis of the potential of the dairy market to expand.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">One simple statistic is that the world population is increasing by more than 6 million per month.  Prior to the economic turmoil that has been with us for almost a year, there was growing affluence in the world.  There has been a change in the dietary requirements of people in the huge population blocs of Asia, China and India.  India and China have populations in excess of 1 billion, and new markets for dairy products have emerged in these countries.  We have reached a crunch period.  The upward trajectory in prices that we saw in 2007 was followed by a decline in global demand because of the credit crunch and the lack of disposable income in the international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">The health check is the proper mechanism under which to address these issues.  Ireland has the capacity to grow its dairy industry, and the medium to long-term outlook is positive.  This is not to minimise the serious difficulties currently faced by the industry, as referred to by Deputies Creed and Sherlock.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_96">The arrangements for payment of grants under the farm waste management scheme on a phased basis have been confirmed, with 40% being paid this year as claims are approved.  A further 40% will be paid in early January 2010 and the remaining 20% in January 2011.  I have also announced that a special <i>ex gratia</i> payment not exceeding 3.5% of the value of the deferred amount will be made to farmers whose farm waste management grants have been partially deferred.  This payment will be made in January 2011 along with the final instalment.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">The Revised Estimates for the public service will be published following the budgetary adjustments planned for 7 April.  Funding for my Department, including the allocation for the farm waste management scheme, is being considered in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">I assure the Minister that I am not seeking any budgetary figures and do not intend to probe into confidential Cabinet deliberations.  Does the Minister accept there is a shortfall of €105 million in his Department's capacity to make the 40% payments in 2009?  Farmers seek an assurance that the payments they are receiving under various schemes will not be reduced.  In other words, there must be no robbing of Peter to pay Paul.  Rather, supplementary funds must be allocated to meet the Government's liability under the farm waste management scheme.  Will the Minister confirm that the suckler cow welfare scheme, for example, will not be further reduced in order to make up the Department's shortfall?</p>

            <p eId="para_99">Provision will be made in the Revised Estimates to meet the commitments we have given to those farmers who are due grant payments under the farm waste management scheme.  So far this year, of the 40% to be paid, almost €66 million has issued to almost 5,000 farmers.  Departmental officials at local level are carrying out inspections as expeditiously as possible in order to ensure that appropriate payments are made at the earliest possible date.  This is a scheme of investment of €1.1 billion over a short period.</p>

Will the Minister give an assurance that disadvantaged area payments will not be impacted?  Will he give an assurance that access to REPS 4 will not be closed off as was done?  If the Minister takes the liberty of repeating issues, I will take the liberty of recalling chapter and verse the cutbacks he has introduced already — disadvantaged area payments, installation aid and early retirement scheme.  Are we going to have a further litany to make up for the mathematical bungling in the Department which did not provide adequate funding from the first day?  Is the shortfall €105 million?

            <p eId="para_121">I announced yesterday that unused funds available in 2009 from the single farm payment national reserve would be paid to hill sheep farmers in the form of an uplands sheep payment.  The amount in question is approximately €7 million in 2009.  These funds have become available as a result of a request by me, supported by a number of my counterparts from other European Union member states, in the context of the health check negotiations, for the facility to use unspent funds from the national single farm payment ceilings to fund measures targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Under the scheme I announced yesterday and based on the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the new payment this year.  On the basis of data available for 2008, I estimate that the level of aid will be of the order of €35 per hectare with a maximum payment of €525 per farmer.  Payments will commence on 1 December 2009.  In introducing this payment my main objective was to address the difficulties and specific costs, including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector.  In reaching the decision I was mindful of the need to ensure that it created no additional burden for farmers, was simple and had a low cost to administer.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">This payment, for which I sought and secured the agreement of the Commission, is for 2009 alone.  I will make a decision on the use of unspent CAP funds from 2010 onwards when further information is available on the detailed EU rules that will apply.  I understand that the Commission will bring forward its proposals in this regard very shortly and they will be adopted in May or June of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">A maximum payment of €525 per sheep farmer will do nothing to arrest the alarming decline in sheep numbers and in particular the decimation of sheep stock with the slaughter of ewes in recent years.  The Minister's decision is motivated more by the numbers game rather than any strategic analysis of what the industry needs and flies in the face of the Malone report, for example, which clearly indicated the problems.  What the Minister gives with one hand he takes away with the other.  As late as last Monday at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council he decided to proceed with the compulsory electronic tagging of sheep which will take away more than the €525, which is the maximum payment.  How can the Minister claim that what he is delivering to sheep farmers will in any way address the critical structural problems in the industry, which are the exodus of farmers from the industry and the need to ensure the breeding population is maintained in order to sustain the off-farm employment associated with the industry?</p>

            <p eId="para_127">When we succeeded last year in getting the European Commission to give approval in principle to member states having access to unused funds — we sought to have access to all the unused funds for 2009 — that was not agreed at European Union level.  The only funding to which we have access is the €7 million.  I was conscious that it is a relatively small amount of money.  We wanted to ensure there would be no administrative costs in disbursing that money and that we would have quick and ready access to the relevant data to enable us to pay it.  The easiest and most effective way of paying out that funding was on the basis of the 2007-08 sheep census.  People within that category will make the appropriate application with their single-payment form.  If we were to issue it on the basis of any other scheme there would be administrative costs, which would not be beneficial to the individual flock owner.  I was very conscious that we needed to ensure that it went towards an economically or environmentally sensitive category.  That was another consideration.</p>

That would have been the correct strategic decision to make.  While I accept that the €7 million available is nowhere near adequate, it would have sent the type of message necessary to stabilise sheep numbers and give some indication that, for example, in 2010, as the French Minister for Agriculture has already done, the unspent CAP funds in 2010 would be targeted in that direction also.  Would the Minister not accept even at this late stage that he should send a signal to the industry that there will be a reward in 2010 for maintaining the number of breeding ewes on any farm and that that reward will be the ring-fencing of unspent CAP funds, which will in 2010 be in the region of €29 million to farmers who will maintain their breeding ewe numbers for that season?</p>

There is practically no cost — it is only a matter of changing the application form that goes out to each single-payment applicant.  I do not know whether the industry is interested in going along the French route.  The French took a linear cut from the single payment under Article 68 and then put it into a specific fund for sheep.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_75">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_141">New rules restricting fishing vessels' days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the north west of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU's revised cod recovery plan.  The plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings, expressed in kilowatt days, for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to national level.  Member states have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the plan, which include the Irish Sea — International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, area VIIa — and the waters to the north west of Ireland and Scotland — ICES area VIa.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of a European Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each member state in the areas during a reference period of 2004-06 or 2005-07 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">Under the plan, each member state is required to introduce a licensing regime to manage its effort allocations.  Any vessel longer than 10 m overall must have an authorisation from its member state in order to operate in one of the designated areas using the fishing gears covered by the plan.  Member states can decide on the method of allocating their national pools of fishing effort, which are broken down by fishing gear type.  Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort was introduced for the period 1 February to 30 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The pilot scheme used the following approach to allocate fishing effort in areas VIa and VIIa to Irish vessels for the pilot management period of 1 February to 30 April 2009.  First, the track records of vessels operating in areas VIa and VIIa during the reference period of 2005-08 were assessed to determine their eligibility to receive an authorisation to fish and an allocation of days at sea under the pilot scheme.  Each vessel's "best year" of fishing days in the areas during the reference period was used to establish its track record.  Second, distribution bands were established for each of the specified gear types to facilitate the allocation of days at sea to vessels based on their track records with those gears.  Each vessel's level of track record with a gear type fit into one of the distribution bands for that gear type.  The vessel was then allocated the number days at sea for that gear which were associated with that distribution band.  Third, the days at sea allocations for the first management period, 1 February to 30 April 2009, were given on a <i>pro rata</i> basis for each gear type based on Irish vessels’ traditional fishing pattern with the gears in the area during that those months.  For example, if the months were traditionally very busy for a gear type, a higher portion of days at sea were allocated for that gear.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">I appreciate the Deputy's sincerity in this regard.  If the answer had been front-loaded, I would have read the following.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and, therefore, we have established a steering group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and the Department to provide support to the industry in regard to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am prepared to make amendments where proposed by the steering group within the legal framework that was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">With regard to specific initiatives available to Ireland under the terms of the regulation, the group has, at our request, examined the possibility of applying for exemptions for groups of vessels catching less than 1.5% of cod in their catch.  On the basis of this examination, our officials have now made a submission to the European Commission seeking an exemption for any vessel which on an annual basis for the years 2007 and 2008 had less than 1.5% of cod in its catch.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Other measures being examined by the steering group could, under the regulation, be applied in order to buy back effort, which would reduce it from 25% to perhaps 20%, which would mean we would have more to distribute in terms of allocation for the boats that need it.  The measures would include, among other things, the introduction of highly selective fishing gear that reduces cod catches to below 1% and cod avoidance measures such as both mandatory and voluntary seasonal and real-time closures.  The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are currently examining options in this regard which will, in turn, be considered by the steering group.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TomSheahan" eId="spk_89">
            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_161">The Minister of State might add that vessels under 14 m would be exempt.  Some vessels have no days at sea, as the Minister of State noted in his reply, because of history.  With regard to job creation in rural and coastal areas, it is a well known fact that any job created at sea creates seven other jobs on land.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">With regard to the scientific evidence on which this draconian measure, the cod recovery plan, was based, I do not believe there is any such evidence.  Will the Minister of State provide funding for the steering group to undertake in-depth, real-time scientific surveys of stock assessment with immediate effect?  We would then have real data and scientific evidence.  What is happening at present is that vessels are moving to area VIIa.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_90" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_163">Indeed, and I understand the dangers inherent in that.  I agree this is an extremely difficult issue.  However, the scientific evidence is appreciated, even by the fishing organisations, which are not saying to us that there is no evidence pointing to a need for a cod recovery plan.  What has been surprising to all of us is that the Commission has been so drastic and quick in implementing the plan.  We thought we would have a little more time but we must live with what the Commission has decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">I take the Deputy's point with regard to vessels of under 14 m.  That would certainly suit my area of Balbriggan and Skerries.  Many such fishermen are not members of the Federation of Irish Fishermen or the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and they do not feel their voice is being heard.  I am glad I will be able to report that the call for us to seek an exemption is also coming from the other side of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">I cannot give the Deputy an answer at present in regard to providing funding, as he can well understand, but it is something I would appreciate following up on.</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_175">My Department is implementing a number of measures set out in the National Bioenergy Action Plan to increase the share of bioenergy derived from the agriculture and forestry sectors.  The measures include a bioenergy scheme to stimulate production of miscanthus and willow feedstock for use in the bioenergy market.  The cultivation of willow and miscanthus has been relatively undeveloped in Ireland primarily due to high establishment costs estimated at €2,900 per hectare.  The bioenergy scheme aims to kick start production of these crops by grant aiding the costs of establishment.  Under the scheme, farmers can qualify for an establishment grant equal to 50% of the costs of planting willow and miscanthus.  The maximum payment rate is €1,450 per hectare up to a ceiling of 30 hectares per applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The scheme is being operated on a pilot basis up to end 2009.  Since its launch in February 2007 it has generated much interest from farmers.  During the first two phases, the Department provided for the planting of 3,000 hectares.  The actual area planted came to 1,800 hectares.  The third phase was launched in December 2008 providing for planting in 2009 of 900 hectares of miscanthus and 900 hectares of willow.  As in previous years, the allocation was split evenly between both crops. Overall, 271 applications were received to plant 1,850 hectares of miscanthus and 360 hectares of willow.  Pre-planting approvals have been issued in respect of the 900 hectares of miscanthus.  In view of the shortfall in willow applications, my Department has reviewed the ceiling for miscanthus and agreed to issue additional approvals subject to respecting the overall 1,800-hectare ceiling for the bioenergy scheme 2009.  These approvals will issue shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">My Department and Teagasc continue to work with stakeholders to maximise the potential to grow willow and miscanthus in Ireland.  In 2008, Teagasc published a farm diversification manual providing detailed technical advice to farmers on growing willow and miscanthus.  Together with Teagasc and Sustainable Energy Ireland, my Department co-funded an educational DVD <i>Willow and Miscanthus — from Field to Furnace. </i>The Department has also made available best practice guidelines for growing willow and miscanthus under the bioenergy scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">Additional Information not provided on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">The guide provides advice to growers on planting and harvesting operations to maximise crop yield and improve the economic viability of the crop.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">The bioenergy scheme has ignited considerable interest among farmers in growing miscanthus and willow.  It has helped bring some scale to the sector and raised awareness of the potential to grow these crops under Irish conditions.  Overall, the area planted should exceed 3,500 ha by end 2009.  I believe there is significant potential to develop miscanthus and willow planting in Ireland.  My Department will carry out a comprehensive review of the bioenergy scheme in mid-2009 to include an assessment of the need for a further scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and welcome the Department's decision, albeit somewhat belatedly, to reallocate the proportion of the 900 hectares not taken up in respect of willow planting.  I wish to ask two supplementary questions of the Minister of State.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">Has the Department conducted an analysis of the reason take-up in respect of willow planting is not similar to that in respect of miscanthus planting?  It may be that willow planting is less attractive owing to cost and the lead-in time in terms of harvesting, which is longer.  In this regard, if we move from a pilot phase to an established grant aid scheme for these green energy crops, will the Minister of State consider increasing the incentive for willow, which has great potential as a green energy crop?  Will the Minister of State consider moving the scheme from a pilot phase to the introduction of a broadly available grant scheme?  Also, has he considered the reason willow has not been availed of to the same extent as miscanthus?</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_183">I appreciate the Deputy's welcome for the flexibility that has come to bear on this issue.  On willow, there is no doubt but that the lead-in period is a disincentive for people seeking a quick return, which miscanthus can represent.  Given the three year cycle willow planting represents a difficulty arises for farmers in terms of pay-back.  An issue that may perhaps need to be further promoted is that with willow comes other possible farmgate income, which working with local authorities, has shown to provide additional income for farmers.  There may be a need to tweak the scheme to provide an extra incentive in respect of willow and a need to further communicate other income streams that willow may bring with it.  In essence, the feedback we are receiving suggests the lead-in period is the reason more people are not taking up willow.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">The sustainability of a scheme is primarily based on its ability to continue without grant assistance.  That is the essence of sustainability of any scheme.  That being said, it is hoped we will be able to continue to support what is necessary to grow the bioenergy sector in Ireland.  Teagasc is currently undertaking studies in this area and is prepared to give a time of business adviser to farmers to plan what might be a new venture.  Most of the farmers showing an interest come from a cereal farming background from which similar equipment, disciplines and growing techniques can be brought to bear.  Teagasc, rather than re-inventing the wheel, is also taking note of UK studies in this area, which show that with improved varieties and better farming techniques yield in the bioenergy sector can be increased up to 30%.</p>

Some 12 months ago, the main issue, as far as forestry was concerned, was willow coppice planting, which is an ideal tree in terms of green energy production.  I do not understand the reason for the fall-off in respect of willow-coppice planting.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the reason this is happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_191">I will attempt to answer the questions asked by Deputies Doyle and Sheehan.  I agree with Deputy Doyle that this issue must be addressed in the round.  That is the reason there is interdepartmental co-operation on the matter.  It was predicted, in terms of my briefing here today, that we might end up speaking about greener home schemes, heating programmes and so on.  There is a list we could cover in terms of variable overlapping and interdepartmental responses to the challenges of energy security and climate change, of which this issue is a small part.  However, the Government is determined to grow this sector given our very low base in terms of bioenergy in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">The €6 million allocation in grant assistance has gone to 13 projects under the stimulus programme for this area.  This, it is hoped, will give rise to further opportunities in co-operation with Teagasc in regard to the production of biomass at the Oak Park crops research centre.  Along with supporting existing practise, research is being undertaken as we need to, as Deputy Sheehan stated, broaden our work in this area.  We are speaking in this regard of coppicing for which willow, along with other tree species, is suitable.  While we are talking about coppicing, we are also looking at other areas.  Research is being done in the case of bamboo, for example.  That has not been covered yet, but it may well come on stream if it is shown to produce a good return.  We all know that Ireland is good at growing trees.  We need to explore this area further.</p>

            <p eId="para_194">I am not in a position to confirm that payments will continue to be made under the suckler cow welfare scheme.  The Government has decided, having regard to the urgent need to address the public finances, to introduce a supplementary budget in the Dáil on 7 April next.  Over 53,000 farmers applied for the suckler cow welfare scheme in 2008.  The estimated cost of the scheme for that year, at a rate of €80 per cow, is approximately €77 million.  As approximately €33 million had been spent by the end of 2008, a further €44 million has been provided in my Department's 2009 Estimate to pay for the remaining calves that were born in 2008.  Of the €44 million mentioned, over €14.5 million has already been paid to farmers in 2009.  Payments are continuing on a weekly basis as additional animals become eligible and certain application details are clarified with individual applicants.  It must be borne in mind that the money being paid to farmers under this scheme is an additional income stream — it was not there before last year.  All the funding in question is coming from the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_195">I am concerned that the suckler cow welfare scheme may be abolished or further eroded.  That was the basis of my decision to table this question.  Over 32,000 beef farmers have participated in the Teagasc training sessions that are required under the scheme.  It is vitally important that the scheme be maintained in the first instance.  The answer given by the Minister will not reassure the House.  Will the scheme be maintained?  If so, farmers are entitled to know the level at which it will be maintained.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a statement on the budgetary position ahead of 7 April next.  However, farmers are entitled to know whether the scheme will be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">I share Deputy Sherlock's view that this is a good scheme.  It has proven beneficial during the year in which it has been in existence.  As I said in response to a question asked on a previous occasion by Deputy Sherlock or Deputy Creed, it is intended to honour the commitment — to provide €250 million over five years — that was made when the suckler cow welfare scheme was introduced.  I reiterate that the scheme, which is designed to help farmers to adapt to market requirements, provides particular value.  I would like to be able to make a decision as soon as possible.  It will not be possible to make any decisions on the 2009 scheme in advance of the publication of the revised Book of Estimates for the Department, which will happen after the decisions that are made before 7 April are announced in this House on that date.  I remind the House that €31.75 million was paid out in respect of last year's scheme up to the end of 2008.  I can confirm, in response to a question I was asked earlier, that the amount paid so far in 2009 is in excess of €14.6 million.  Therefore, the total amount paid to date under the 2008 scheme is almost €48 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_197">I appreciate that the Government and the Department are having to operate under difficult financial constraints.  The Minister will accept that beef production is a marginal enterprise.  It is a part-time enterprise for many people.  Will the Minister consider revising the terms of the suckler cow welfare scheme so that an €80 level of payment can be guaranteed to all farmers for their first 20, 25 or 30 suckler cows?  That would ensure that the maximum benefit would accrue to smaller producers, in particular.  The level of payment under the scheme could be tapered downwards for applications that are made in respect of greater numbers of animals.  The needs of smaller producers should be prioritised because their capacity to retain an income from farming depends on whether they can draw the maximum amount from this scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_200">Members of this House have also proposed a reduction in the number of years of participation in the scheme.  Although the suckler cow welfare scheme is entirely funded from the Exchequer, the Government had to get state aid approval from the EU before it could be introduced.  Further approval would be needed from the Union if a major variation in the conditions of the scheme were to be made.  Any worthwhile proposals on the continuation of various aspects of the scheme will be considered.  For example, the amount of money paid to an applicant might vary depending on the number of eligible animals he or she has.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">It is only appropriate, on the day that is in it, that the House should take note of the outstanding sporting achievement of the weekend — the winning by the Irish rugby team of its first Grand Slam for 61 years.  The House will agree that it should pay due tribute and give due credit to Declan Kidney, Brian O'Driscoll and all those associated with the victory.  I was one of the team's supporters in Cardiff, in a cauldron of sound, on what was a momentous occasion for the green jersey brigade.  I say "well done" to them.  I also compliment Bernard Dunne on his fabulous individual performance in winning the world super bantamweight title, matching Barry McGuigan's achievement of 24 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">It is possible to contrast that level of euphoria with the despair, fear and confusion of many families, caused by personal circumstances such as unemployment, which stands at over 350,000 and is rising by 1,000 a day on occasion.  Those who are being charged interest rates of over 20% on personal overdrafts are genuinely and absolutely fearful for the futures of their families.  They are being asked to make huge upfront payments — €40,000, €50,000 or €60,000, in some cases — to change from fixed-rate mortgages to variable-rate mortgages.  Many of those whose houses have not yet been repossessed are fearful about the possibility of their houses being repossessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We are aware of what is happening with a small number of individuals in financial institutions.  They have thanked the Government and the taxpayer for the guarantee that now applies to the financial institutions by engaging in disgusting behaviour.  On occasions, they have literally shown the finger to the taxpayer.  I understand that one of the gentlemen in question has secured an obscene defined benefit pension.  He was awarded a bonus of €1 million after the legislation to guarantee the financial institutions was passed by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the extent of the anger on the streets about this issue.  People are absolutely appalled that this should be allowed to go on.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who once more is not present in the Chamber, has said that this position is untenable and that it cannot go on.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that a request has been made for a sum of money to be paid back.  The Green Party has given its view.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach have been quite trenchant from the beginning.  What will we get at the end of all of this?  So far, we have got a statement from the Minister for Finance saying that there will be an investigation and that another report will be published inside a month.  It is always the same, another report.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I ask the Taoiseach to clarify for the House what is the position of the Government in so far as Irish Nationwide Building Society is concerned, and on the return of a €1 million bonus paid subsequent to the guarantee legislation going through the House, which is certainly outside the spirit of the law.  I ask the Taoiseach to inform the House of what he intends to do about this in the immediate term so that we will not have another situation where all we are left with is a response from the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance, another report, another investigation, and will have to wait another month and hope it will blow over.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_209">That is not the purpose of the statement.  The purpose of the statement is to indicate the Minister's intentions on this matter.  He had discussions last evening with the two directors of the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, appointed by him to promote the public interest, Mr. Adrian Kearns and Mr. Rory O'Farrell.  These directors were nominated by the Minister on foot of the Government guarantee scheme and they met the Minister with the knowledge and consent of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Minister has asked the two directors to convey to the board of Irish Nationwide Building Society his view that the board and management team must be reviewed having regard to the current market position, the plans of the society and the appropriate mix of skills for the future of the society.  The Minister has indicated that he will invite the board to brief him next week on its plans for the society, including the review of management and board personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">It is the Minister's view that recent disclosures on the remuneration of the CEO of the INBS require investigation.  The Minister has conveyed to the board that any such investigation must be carried out by the two directors appointed to promote the public interest and he expects the report on the outcome of this investigation within one month.  What that means, of course, is that he wants the facts established as to the circumstances in which this matter arose so that we can see what precise action can be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Deputy Kenny will be aware that the committee established by the Minister for Finance reported at that time that no bonuses should be paid in institutions which are covered by the guarantee scheme.  We need to see what way that can be assured in this case and what has been happening by reason of the actions he is now taking.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">The fact of the matter is that a €1 million bonus has been paid to the individual concerned.  That is not in doubt.  When the Taoiseach states he wants to establish the facts, that is the principal fact.  A bonus of €1 million was paid after the legislation went through this House.  Last October when speaking on this Bill, I made the point that following the enactment of this legislation no bonus, no dividend or other moneys should be paid to any individual without absolute clearance from here.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">In fact, Deputy Bruton put down an amendment to the financial guarantee Bill to that effect, that payment of dividends, bonuses and other moneys should be restricted, as appropriate, that might in any way limit the rebuilding of the credibility and the capital base of the financial institution involved.  The Minister for Finance responded to that amendment by stating: "Financial institutions as a whole in Ireland, both domestic and those in the Irish Financial Services Centre, need highly experienced, skilled and expert people to succeed."</p>

          <p eId="para_216">That is true and there is no denying it, and what happened here is absolutely where highly experienced, skilled and expert people did succeed in establishing one particular fact, namely that a €1 million bonus was paid out after the legislation went through this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance when we debated the nursing homes Bill here.  As Deputy O'Dowd dealt at the time with the range of elderly people who were frightened and terrified in their health institutions, the Government, because it wanted to do it, was able to put through legislation as a principle and make it retrospective.  The amendment tabled for Fine Gael by Deputy Bruton was to the effect that no dividend, no bonus or any other moneys should be paid to individuals in this regard.  If it was possible to bring legislation before the House and make it retrospective where elderly people were concerned and frightened out of their wits about being charged for their stay in long-stay institutions, the same principle should apply now.  The Taoiseach has one undisputed fact, that a €1 million bonus was paid.  If he wants to follow the same principle, the amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton on behalf of Fine Gael is as relevant now as it was then.  If the Taoiseach wishes, on behalf of the Government, I will give him time to make this amendment to the legislation.  Then he will have authority, if he does not have it already, to take back this money that was paid out as a bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Is the Taoiseach prepared to consider that?  Is he prepared to take swift, appropriate and decisive action now and not have us waiting for another month to establish what we already know, namely, that a bonus of €1 million was paid out after the legislation went through here in a case that people find appalling and obscene?  At a time when people are losing their jobs all over the country, where they fear that their houses will be repossessed, where they are being penalised with in excess of 20% interest on personal overdraft facilities and where they are being asked for huge amounts of money to change from fixed to variable mortgages, it is not fair and it is not just.  This is not the kind of country that we need.  The Taoiseach is in charge of the Government and he should act decisively now, and I will support him on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">The Government will explore all options available to it based on the facts to be established.  It is a question of whether this was an arrangement that was entered into before the State guarantee scheme was brought into play; what authorisation there was for it by the board; in what way it was in the interests of the society that such an arrangement be made; and in what way were the fiduciary duties of directors discharged in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The Government is quite clear on the matter.  The Government has put out its position regarding the question of remuneration for senior bankers or for people in building societies and we have already indicated the salary caps that should apply.  What we are saying here on this particular matter is that the Minister, using the public interest directors he has appointed, will ensure that he gets to the bottom of this issue in terms of the circumstances that apply to it and decide on that basis what are the legal avenues available to him and what way can it be arranged that that issue can be dealt with satisfactorily.  That is what he wishes to do to allay the public concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">The Minister for Finance was in London on St. Patrick's Day telling the assembled gathering that the Government would crack down on crony-capitalism in Ireland.  The Labour Party warmly welcomes that.  There are certainly a few cronies on whom one could crack down.  We have Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is known to his cronies as Seanie; Mr. Fingleton, known to his cronies as Fingers; and now a Green crony, Mr. McCaughey, who, of course, has legally avoided the payment of capital gains tax by the convenient means of transferring the shares to his spouse who then transferred herself to Italy for the best part of a year to qualify as a tax exile.  I want to ask the Taoiseach a couple of questions arising from these.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">On Mr. Fingleton, like Deputy Kenny, I was surprised at the statement which has just been issued by the Minister for Finance which effectively states that the Minister will take a month to investigate what remuneration was paid to Mr. Fingleton.  It is already in the public domain that Mr. Fingleton paid himself a bonus of €1 million after the guarantee scheme came into effect.  Taxpayers who await the worst of news on budget day, which is less than a month away, will want to know whether the Government will recoup that and how such a bonus could be paid after the guarantee scheme came into effect when we were told the Government had given itself very considerable powers to exercise control on these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">What Mr. McCaughey did was perfectly legal; that is the problem.  Can the Taoiseach give some assurance to the taxpayers of the country, who are likely to be hit with further tax increases in the budget, that this arrangement concerning tax exiles will be ended once and for all?  People are scandalised that this type of arrangement can be entered into, that if one is wealthy enough and has good accountants one can get around tax liabilities while PAYE workers and businesses which are trying to keep going have no escape.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who appointed Mr. McCaughey as chairman of the Dublin Docklands Authority, said he is "one of our most successful green entrepreneurs and in the past decade has shown clear leadership on issues including regulatory reform [and] sustainable business practices".  Does the Minister still have confidence in Mr. McCaughey as chairman of the Dublin Docklands Authority?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">This morning the Minister for Finance informed the Government of his intentions to ensure the public interest directors are given the opportunity exclusively to investigate the circumstances in which such a bonus payment was paid in the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The mandate given to them was to do so within a month.  He has also indicated that the members of the board will come to see him within the coming week with a view to examining the situation as he believes the board and management need to be reviewed and changed in view of what has been happening.  Upon establishment of the facts we are as determined as anybody else, working within the legal means available to us, to see how the Government's intent and policy on the payment of bonuses to people in covered institutions is respected and implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I am aware of the report on the second matter, which was aired this morning and the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment in any detail on individuals' tax affairs.  These are matters between the individuals concerned and the Revenue Commissioners.  As a result of cases that have come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners involving transfers of assets between spouses and the use of reliefs provided under tax treaties with other countries, changes in the capital gains tax legislation were introduced in section 75 of the Finance Act 2006.  That  amendment of the principal Act removed the exemption of gains on transfers between spouses in such cases.  Arrangements undertaken before the Finance Act 2006 are the subject of litigation and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on them.  The Revenue Commissioners will continue to hold the view that requires it to pursue these matters in respect of those arrangements prior to enactment of the Finance Act 2006 through litigation.  When this matter came to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, its recommendation was adopted in finance legislation and arrangements prior to the Finance Act 2006 are the subject of litigation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_230">When the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appointed the individual concerned as chairman of the Dublin Docklands Authority, was he aware that these matters were already under consideration by the Revenue Commissioners and that they had given rise to the change in legislation the Taoiseach described?  I do not understand why the investigation of the payment to Mr. Fingleton has to take a month.  When the United States Government discovered very big bonuses were being paid to people in AIG, it did not take a month to deal with it.  Taking a month here means deferring a decision until after the budget and Easter, and putting it into Never-Never Land where matters under investigation are overtaken by other events.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">On 30 September 2008 Deputy Burton proposed specific amendments to the bank guarantee legislation to the effect that caps should be placed on the remuneration given to the top people in financial institutions.  The Minister for Finance assured her that there were sufficient powers in the Bill he presented to deal with any eventuality of this kind.  Section 5 of the Act provides that "The Minister may, in respect of any difficulty that arises in the operation of this Act during the period of two years ... make regulations to do anything that appears necessary or expedient".  The Act goes on to provide that in circumstances where the institutions concerned do not comply with such directions and rulings by the Minister for Finance, he could withdraw the financial support and guarantees given to these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Minister for Finance has the power to require that these bonuses be repaid and to ensure that whatever other steps to deal with it are taken.  Why are we waiting a month for this?  Facts are easily established.  What payment was made?  When was it made?  Who authorised it?  Was any clearance sought from the Minister or Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator?  Was it cleared by the board?  It does not take a month to establish these facts.  This must be dealt with speedily because the public, which is being asked to shoulder the burden of the difficult economic circumstances, needs to have it addressed before the budget.  The international financial markets, which do not look very favourably on this country or our banking and financial system, need to see that our Government is dealing with this quickly.  The Government should  not be looking for a report in a month's time when it might be considered and dealt with on a méar fada basis.  The Taoiseach should deal with it quickly.  The power to deal with it is in the legislation and there is no justification for delaying for a month.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">The statement makes clear the matter will be addressed within a month.  In the meantime, apart from meeting with the public interest directors, the Minister will meet the board and existing management within the coming week and has outlined his views regarding the Government's arrangements in the building society for the future.  He has indicated that the public interest directors alone will investigate this matter on his behalf and the public interest directors have the confidence of this House so to do in a way that will ensure an outcome that will comply with the legislative intentions of this House and within the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The question arises as to whether in fact a bonus arrangement was agreed by the board in respect of the chief executive concerned which predated the enactment of the State guarantee legislation.  That issue must be established as well as the circumstances in which, if that were the case, it happened and, third, what legal options are available to us as a result.  This can only be established on the basis of facts to be obtained by the public interest directors.  It is a question of ensuring that we proceed in the proper fashion and make sure we achieve an outcome the Government is as anxious as anyone else to see, which is the return of the bonus concerned.</p>

The Minister has also made the Department available to the Opposition for confidential costings of proposals.

Large sums of money are being lost to the industry as a result of the growth in Internet betting.  That is why I would like it to be debated here.  What steps will be taken to deal with this loss?  I agree with the sentiments of the motion but I seek an increase in the revenue and clarification for those who seem to think that money provided for horse and greyhound racing is a grant.  It is not a grant and does not affect other grants.  It is a levy imposed on bookmakers, as it should be.  Where and when will we take money from Internet betting which is growing considerably at the expense of the off-course bookmakers?</p>

It involves the Presidency checking with other member states regarding the proposed contents of these guarantees and obtaining from them their views on giving support to the guarantees.  That process is ongoing and it must harden up, as it were.  We might then see that the drafting proposals or the conversations now taking place will result in a text that will have broad, indeed unanimous, support.

          <p eId="para_327">One of the objectives of the Government's deliberations at present is to protect as far as possible and to the greatest extent the weakest in society as we try to stabilise the public finances and move them towards balance in the coming years.  I point out that during better times this Government's record in respect of social welfare increases is a very good one, comparing most favourably with that of any preceding Administration.  Consistently, social welfare entitlements ran well in excess of consumer price index and cost of living increases.  That was quite rightly the case as we sought to implement the national anti-poverty strategy which brought basic payments well up to the percentage of average wages, as was required under that strategy.  Indeed, that objective was exceeded with regard to pensions, child benefit and the introduction of a number of supports which have had a major effect in reducing to historically low levels the levels of consistent poverty in this country, despite the recent very difficult times we have experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The record of social welfare support was based very much on the philosophy of those Governments, namely, to ensure that the improved resources generated during the good times provided for those most vulnerable.  That is evidenced by the fact that we now have a social welfare and social support system that costs taxpayers in the region of €21 billion now against revenues that are in the €30 billions rather than the €40 billions or €50 billions as envisaged.  That is an indication of the considerable resources that were quite rightly applied to this area in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">We must now adapt to a new situation.  The question of sustainability is as, or more, important for those on limited incomes as it is for those who are in a position through their productive life to obtain remuneration well in excess of social welfare entitlements.  The question of sustainabilitly is as important for those categories as it is for others.  It behoves us all to make sure we try to address that issue.  The room for manoeuvre is clearly very limited.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I am pleased to open this debate on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The Minister will speak tomorrow in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">There is no doubt that we are facing the most challenging global and domestic economic circumstances in generations.  Our position as a small open economy, which has facilitated our recent prosperity, has also left us vulnerable to the rapid deterioration in the international environment.  This Government took early and decisive action in respect of the deteriorating financial situation and we have sought to retain the flexibility required to nimbly respond to the rate of change being experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Our plan has remained constant right from the start — to attack the gap in public finances; to sort out the banks; to create and save jobs; to protect and support the unemployed; and to restore Ireland's international reputation by strengthening our domestic governance arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">This Government has already taken important action to address the emerging difficult economic and budgetary situation by bringing forward the budget, implementing taxation and spending changes and introducing a pension contribution for public servants.  The decisions, which the Government will take as part of the supplementary budget on 7 April, will be designed to stabilise the public finances and improve confidence in Ireland both at home and abroad and thereby secure the future economic viability of this country.  Today's debate allows the Oireachtas the opportunity to debate and discuss the kind of measures necessary to position Ireland for the next phase of its economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Much of what has been achieved over the past 20 years has been based on key factors, which still remain.  Challenging decisions lie ahead and the immediate task——</p>

          <p eId="para_368">My script will be available for circulation to Members. Challenging decisions lie ahead and the immediate task facing Government and consistent with our plan is to address difficulties in the public finances, as they continue to emerge, while positioning the economy to benefit as the global economy improves.  We are all well aware that both the domestic and international economic environments have deteriorated dramatically over a short period of time.  Ireland, along with almost every other country in the world, is now confronting major challenges.  We need to remain flexible and respond swiftly to these challenges as they emerge.  Global economic activity will contract by between 0.5% and 1% this year, according to the IMF.  This would be the first decline in activity in 60 years.  For advanced countries — which constitute a large part of our export market — the situation is even worse; GDP is projected to decline by more than 3% in these countries this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The effects on world economic activity as a result of the deterioration in global financial market conditions have proven to be worse than anticipated and in many regions the economic data which have become available in recent weeks have been overwhelmingly negative.  Clearly, Ireland cannot be immune from these developments.  At the same time, the changing global environment has been also associated with major exchange rate re-alignments, the most notable from our perspective being the very significant depreciation of sterling, which has exacerbated the deterioration of our cost competitiveness.  On the domestic front, the ongoing correction in the house building sector continues to spread to the rest of the economy.  Unemployment has risen sharply, tax receipts have continued to decline and confidence has plummeted.  Last week's retail sales figures relating to January were extremely disappointing and give an illustration — if one were needed — of the scale of the uncertainty currently prevailing.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The current indications are that activity in Ireland could contract around 6.5% this year.  This contraction in GDP is having a very significant impact on our resources and on what we can afford to do.  It is worth reminding ourselves of the strengths which have underpinned Ireland's recent economic performance — several of which remain supportive and will help position us to take advantage of the global recovery as it emerges.  Our economy remains flexible and resilient which will help facilitate a more rapid adjustment than would otherwise be the case, and we are already seeing wage cuts in many sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We are also in the fortunate position of having a low public debt burden.  This will inevitably change in current circumstances but the low level to which we brought the debt in the past two decades is very helpful and gives us additional flexibility.  In addition, our labour force continues to be highly skilled and we are continuing to invest in education at all levels to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge-intensive economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">As a small trading economy, sustainable improvements in Irish living standards can be achieved only by supplying goods and services to the wider global economy.  The Government's over-riding objective is to position the economy in order to be able to exploit that global recovery when it emerges.  This is the reason we are taking action to put the public finances on a more sustainable path, to get credit flowing, and to improve competitiveness.  This is the precise plan we have been following.  We must also bear in mind that when one considers the scale of fiscal, and perhaps more important, monetary stimulus that is being implemented in many key regions, global recovery could potentially arise more rapidly than currently foreseen.  We must have our house in order in order that we can suitably benefit should this be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The open nature of our economy has meant that international attention is now concentrated on Ireland.  The markets, on which we are dependent for borrowing, need to have confidence that we can address our own difficulties.  To build this confidence, we now need to take the appropriate budgetary measures to restore the public finances to a sustainable footing.  Our debt servicing costs have been low as a share of tax revenue and while they will rise over the next few years reflecting the increased debt needed and market conditions, we do not want to return to the bad old days where more and more of our tax revenue went in simply servicing our debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">We cannot look outward for solutions; the primary source of our recovery must be found within.  This Government is determined to find the solutions necessary to renew and revitalise the Irish economy.  Restoring our domestic cost competitiveness is key to positioning ourselves for the future.  We will ensure the proper policies are in place.  All options have to be examined in that context and everything must be on the table for review.  Action has been already taken and it is worth recalling that the scale and severity of the international downturn has meant that many Governments are continually adapting and revising their responses as the recession deepens.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Last July the Government acted by announcing spending cuts of €400 million effective for 2008 and €1 billion in 2009.  This was followed by the introduction in the budget in October 2008 of additional revenue raising measures of close to €2 billion.  We set a vision for the future with our document, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, in December 2008.  In early January 2009, the Government set a five year framework to restore order to the public finances.  This plan was accepted and welcomed by the European Commission and supported by the President of the European Central Bank when he visited Ireland recently.  In February 2009, in line with the framework, a series of measures to secure further savings of up to €2 billion on a full year basis were put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We are steadfastly committed to sustainable public finances.  The decisive actions taken to date underline that commitment as well as demonstrating the very difficult trading situation we are currently in, with the position changing on an almost daily basis.  Last month's Exchequer returns show that tax revenues for the first two months of the year are one quarter less than what was collected in the same period last year.  Taxes are down right across the board.  Expenditure pressures are also arising and higher numbers out of work are adding to the cost of the live register.  A deterioration of this magnitude cannot go unanswered and the Government will announce further necessary measures on 7 April next, involving the introduction of additional taxation and expenditure measures in 2009 to ensure the general Government deficit this year is managed.  In doing so, the Government has looked to find cross-party support for our efforts to address the difficulties in the public finances.  The Minister for Finance has engaged in an open way with the Opposition by arranging for officials to brief the main Opposition spokespersons on the latest available figures and on the emerging position.  The social partners have been also included in this process.  The Opposition has been also asked to submit any proposals they may have to the Department of Finance for costing by officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The fiscal strategy to be adopted now will underpin the future recovery of the Irish economy.  All sides of the House have a role to play in supporting the efforts of the Government in dealing with this unprecedented downturn.  Future decisions will continue to be informed by the Government's framework for sustainable economic renewal, published in December, which provides a blueprint to best position the economy to benefit when the international environment begins to improve.  Innovation, research and development, environmental and energy-related product and services development, critical infrastructure investment, employment-intensive supports and public sector reform are all key strategies contained within the framework to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">On the issue of banking, we have acted resolutely but must face the reality that the reputation of the sector and our economy has been damaged by the actions of some of our bankers and clear regulatory failures.  In line with the fifth point of our plan, which is, to restore Ireland's international reputation, we have acted decisively and the Minister will shortly announce the details of radical reform of the system and methods of financial supervision and regulation in this country.  It is imperative that our international standing and reputation in the global financial services community is restored.  We are determined to ensure that the regulatory framework for financial services in Ireland meets the Government's triple objectives of maintaining a stable and sound financial system, having effective and efficient supervision of the financial sector, and safeguarding the interests of consumers.  The Government's approach has been structured and considered.  It has been informed throughout by advice from and in consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency and legal and financial advisers.  In addition, the Government will continue to have regard to discussions with the EU and  to agreed principles at EU level.  Our approach to the banking crisis has been based on three broad principles, namely, protecting depositors and creditors and overall financial stability by protecting systemically important financial institutions; ensuring the flow of credit to the real economy; and any State involvement in financial institutions will protect taxpayers' interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The Government will introduce new structures for banking regulation and provide for the integration of Central Bank responsibilities with the regulatory and supervisory functions, new standards of corporate governance and a new approach to enhance consumer protection.  These changes will restore our reputation and be consistent with the emerging international agenda for reform in the financial services sector.  Structural changes and a substantial increase in regulatory capacity will lead to a more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system which will be aligned to best international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">For the supplementary budget the Government has a number of key messages to deliver demonstrating a coherent and effective strategy to achieve the full revitalisation and renewal of the economy: Government action on the public finances is being taken in response to the continued deterioration of economic conditions; the supplementary budget will contain measures to control public spending and increase tax revenues; it will reaffirm the commitment to bring the current budget to surplus by 2013; Government borrowing will be increased but will remain at a manageable  level; our regulatory and supervisory structures will be reformed, thereby restoring the reputation of the Irish financial services sector; and, through the actions to be taken in the budget, the Government will demonstrate its firm intention to address the difficulties both in the public finances and in the Irish financial services regulatory system.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The restoration of the public finances to a stable and sustainable footing and the revitalisation of the economy are challenges the Government will address successfully.  The exact details of the Government's plan for the necessary fiscal adjustments will be unveiled on 7 April.  Above all else, the decisions will be taken in a fair and equitable manner, while protecting the most vulnerable in society.  The measures to be taken will require us to act firmly in the national interest.  Those who can bear the greatest burden will be asked to do so.  In this manner the measures taken will address our cost base, improve our competitiveness, reorientate the economy towards innovation and export-led growth in a fair and equitable manner.  The Government will set out a clear and successful strategy to deal with the public finances, the economy and address the difficulties that have emerged in the public finances.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I am bitterly disappointed at the standard of the Government's treatment of this debate.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance 11 days ago looking for the revised economic forecast for GDP, an updated figure for the tax forecasts for this year, with information on a number of other available tax options.  We are facing into an unprecedented set of decisions and the House needs the maximum information in order that we may subject the available options to scrutiny, if we hope to make the best choices in these extremely difficult times to protect employment and the economy and build for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I do not know whom the Government believes it is fooling.  I do not want to cast any aspersions on the Minster for Transport who was sent into the House to lead the debate.  However, it seems extraordinary, at a time when people are talking openly about the possibility of national bankruptcy, that the Minister for Finance does not believe it is worth his while to lead the debate on the issue of how we should prepare for the extremely difficult set of decisions we have to make.  Frankly, I do not understand it.  I wrote to the Minister a long time ago and have sought to contribute in a constructive manner to this debate in order that we might have a meaningful discussion about the budgetary options available.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">If there is one thing we have learned from recent budgets it is that wholly inappropriate decisions have been made year after year because budgetary options have not been subjected to scrutiny.  We persisted with tax reliefs building the property bubble to an unprecedented level because, again, tax expenditures were not subjected to scrutiny.  Ministers have hidden behind the secrecy afforded by the budgetary process to conceal from the public what they are at.  This has brought the Government and the economy, as well as the House, into disrepute.  At a time of crisis the Government cannot see beyond the length of its long political nose to see that this is a time for doing things differently and realising that we have to renew politics in confronting it.  The Minister has not said anything about the budgetary framework, the level of tax receipts he hopes will be achieved this year, the scale of the deficit we have to bridge or the balance between taxation and spending cuts he believes is appropriate.  These are matters on which the Government surely has an opinion and on which the House should be informed in order that we can have a meaningful debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">This is a vibrant economy.  The whole world looked at Ireland because we were able to produce an economy with high productivity, high export growth and sound public finances.  That economy was destroyed, however, by a catastrophic failure, namely, the embrace of high spending and high cost governance supported by an unsustainable property bubble.  The catastrophic failures that happened on the Government's watch are being simply glossed over.  The trouble is that many of the decisions central to the problems we face are ones the Government have walked us into, for example, by the irresponsible fiscal stimulus it pursued, particularly at election time, and the unsustainable pay settlement strategies, not only benchmarking, but afterwards in wanting to award Ministers the crazy pay packets it stated were in line with comparators in the private sector.  Its methods of budgeting, as we see today, were not fit for running a corner shop, let alone an economy of the scale and importance of Ireland's.  Then there was the deliberate sabotage of a performance culture in the public service, with the decisions on decentralisation and the HSE.  It destroyed the quality of professionalism, effectively stating to public servants that when it came to political decisions, standards of governance did not matter: "We will move people around like pawns on a board."   The only reason for establishing the HSE was to sweep away bureaucratic excess; instead a guarantee was given to all bureaucrats that they could stay in place and a super-bureaucracy was foisted on the public on top of it.  Is that not saying to committed public servants, in effect, "We do not care about efficiency or professional standards"?</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The Government has been guilty of following a style of governance where the transforming power of the new economy in Ireland did not reach into many sectors, but rather into privileged and protected sectors which could circle the wagons and protect their own interests.  I list among these, for example, monopoly utilities which have become the most expensive in the country and believe they can give their employees pay increases when employees in the rest of the economy are taking pay cuts.  The banking sector always had a commitment that the taxpayer would provide a guarantee.  Even now, with the taxpayer having to ride in to rescue them, the banks believe they can still dish out bonuses to their top executives.  They do not believe they need to sweep away the executives who steered the economy down the cul-de-sac in which we are severely impaired and from which we are trying to get out.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Neither have big public bureaucracies been held accountable, which is no surprise.  People were let down by these sectors which were under-regulated and undermanaged on the Government's watch.  This has been a really serious problem as regards the approach the Government has taken.  It was never willing to confront the deep fault lines in public policy that allowed what happened to the economy to take place.  Reform was always out of bounds, to be postponed to another day.  Problems were bought out.  The Government prided itself on the way it could buy out any vested interest that was giving out or threatening.  A small circle of people had unrivalled access to the Government and still does.  Those who questioned the "miracle" of the property driven economy were frozen out and told they were Jeremiahs and fit to commit suicide.  That is the legacy.  Regulation was based on the simple faith that those in charge knew best.  There was no scrutiny of the regulations passed.  The trouble is that the original strength of the economy, a shared analysis of our problems, time after time turned into a dangerous consensus which was low on reform, competition and scrutiny, as well as weak on performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">There has been gross failure, even on the watch of the Minister for Transport who is brave enough at least to admit it, but gross failure, for example, as regards climate change, has no consequences for any Minister.  That is the legacy we face and what must be corrected in this budget if we are to start to turn things around.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">We are facing a meltdown in this economy.  Living standards in the country will be hit with an at least 20% cut.  As a community, we have choices in that we can circle the wagons, protect those in strong positions, take no cuts and leave it to the unemployed and the young people coming out of our schools and colleges to take the brunt of the pain or we can all knuckle down and say it is time for radical change in the way we do our business, starting with Government and politics and extending to the banks, the public utilities and the public sector.  That is what this budget must be about.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The budget must be about reinventing Ireland, our public sector, our economy, the social contract and our face to the world.  Until Ministers are willing to say they made huge mistakes, that we must change the way money is spent in this country and that we must change the standards of performance which pass for good enough — that applies to Ministers as well as public servants and everyone in this economy — we are completely at nought in having debates such as this.  We will come to 7 April and we will still not have changed anything that will strengthen this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I am scared that the approach the Government will take to this budget will sleep walk us into an economic disaster.  It would have been enlightening to hear the deficit target for the end of this year to which the Government is working.  Will we have to meet a target of 9.5% come hell or high water?  The truth is we cannot control that deficit target.  It could be wiped out by bad May returns and bad June returns.  Will the Minister come back in May and June and announce more taxes to chase the economy further down?</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Let us be honest with ourselves.  The only target we can set is in regard to the structural deficit.  That is ignoring the business cycle.  We can change what is happening to the underlying trend in public spending versus public taxation and we must drive that down.  That deficit, of a scale of approximately 8%, has become too large and must be eliminated over a period of four years.  If the Minister said that, we would have some credibility — that there will be an underlying structural reform package, that we have a view of what the structural deficit associated with that will be, that we will squeeze out cost over that period and that we will not give international commitments to the EU or anyone else about the level of borrowing because we cannot make such a commitment in that we do not know the depth or pace of the depression into which we are entering.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">We need to make credible commitments internationally.  Has the Government committed internationally to this 9.5% target about which we keep hearing?  Has it made a decision that we will meet it, come hell or high water, because that is what we were told by the Taoiseach ten days ago?  I am not sure that is the case.  I do not believe it is a wise commitment to make because it is one we cannot control.  We can only control the underlying deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I despair when I hear the Minister and the Taoiseach come into the House and say the secrecy of the budget is sacrosanct, that Government must make decisions and that it cannot provide any information to the Opposition.  That is basically what the Taoiseach said in the House one hour ago.  If that is the case, we are back to where we always were.  I refer to statements like that which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, made about the role of the Opposition.  He stated, "In doing so, the Government has looked to find cross-party support for its efforts to address the difficulties in the public finances."  Does the Minister seriously expect it will get cross-party support by coming into the House on 7 April listing off expenditure cuts and tax increases and that the Opposition will rally to the flag and say this is a wonderful Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_395">There is a role for the Opposition in this House.  It is a role of scrutiny and of stress testing proposals emanating from Government.  This Government has destroyed that role in regard to budgetary strategy.  We have learned to our expense what that has meant.  After its last budget, the Government had to do a U-turn on many critical aspects.  It destroyed its own credibility and our international credibility by not having a budget on which it could stand over.  If it took up the Opposition's offer to have a serious debate about the options, perhaps we could stress test some of decisions in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">It is essential as we approach this crisis that we use it to reinvent this country.  We must embed reform and not engage simply in slash and burn.  We must choose taxes which promote efficiency in the way we use resources and not simply chase the economy down.  We must find catalysts for economic opportunity so that even in this difficult time, we can find ways to seize and work the opportunities which remain to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">There must be a dramatic cut in the cost of doing things.  That must start with the Government.  We must halve the number of Ministers of State, halve the number of committees and cut back on top level pay in the public service, including our own, an issue which still has to be addressed.  We must end increments in the public service to get us through this difficult time.  We must be genuinely willing to cut the cost of what we do and what everyone else does, otherwise the brunt of this crisis will be borne by people who have joined the live register queues.  That is the sort of leadership we should see from Government, that is, we need to see how it will reform itself and then move to reform public spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The profound change in public spending which we now need means that budgets must no longer be about the demands of agencies but about the needs of ordinary people.  Agencies and units of government should bid for money on the basis of what they can deliver.  Is it not extraordinary and ludicrous that hospitals which face tight budgets close wards and beds and turn away their patients?  Can one think of anything more ludicrous than a budgetary system which traps committed talented public servants in our hospitals into turning away patients as a way to become more effective?  Surely we should have a system where money follows the patient and where hospitals which are efficient can deliver more patients for money and where the response to difficulties is to cut overheads and treat more patients more efficiently and not turn them away.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">This budget must be the start of a major set of reforms starting with Government and then spreading out into the public service and beyond, into the kind of smart investments we make for new opportunities.  I saw no such approach in the Minister's opening remarks, which depressed me.  It depresses me that we are going through this sham of a debate at a time when the country is looking for leadership and for Parliament to play a meaningful role in offering that leadership.  The Government is too short-sighted to see the opportunity.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_400">The former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, warned that it is often the little things which trip one up.  I say to the absent Minister for Finance, who is rather discourteous in not attending the opening of this debate, not to dream of coming into the House on 7 April if he has not sorted out the Fingleton affair.  Mr. Fingleton is not a single bad apple; there is a barrel full of bad apples.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Minister has been incredibly slow in cracking the whip of extraordinary powers he took to himself in the legislation on the covered institutions.  We pointed out earlier the four or five plenipotentiary sections of the Act which give massive powers to the Minister to impose what conditions he likes and which leave the way open to him to recover the €1 million bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Irish Nationwide Building Society is, in international terms, a tiny financial institution.  When one recalls the furore and action in America regarding the $165 million in bonuses paid to the executives of AIG, which is a huge corporation by global standards, it is important to remember that Mr. Fingleton's €1 million bonus is on a par with the total bonuses of all the AIG executives.  That is how much money this individual has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">There is nothing that corrodes confidence as much as the belief that sacrifices, like taxes, are only for the little people.  Unless the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, can show in the emergency budget that he will have fairness and justice, he does not have a prayer of getting the plain people of Ireland on his side.  It is the same when tough decisions have to be made about the whole edifice of political patronage and the whopping cost of the payroll vote that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, constructed.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, will have persuaded the Taoiseach to have the reforms done and dusted before he rises to his feet on 7 April.  If he does not have a plan fully in place by then to reduce the number of Ministers of State, as well as the numbers of committee Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen, and ministerial salaries, privileges and pensions, public hostility will be so great as to undermine any capacity to accept the really big adjustments likely to be announced in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I heard the story about Fianna Fáil and the Green Party's newly-appointed chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He was given the honour by the Government of being chairperson of a large public corporation, a singular honour and responsibility.  Apparently, all he was involved in was an ordinary piece of clever tax planning to abuse and utilise our non-residency laws by his family members.  If that does not cry to heaven the need to close down on the tax exiles and super millionaires who continue to pay no tax, I do not know when this Government will ever bring in tax justice for ordinary workers.  The people who work in this House, those who work as teachers, nurses and doctors up and down the country and ourselves are paying, if one is on a higher salary, approximately 10%  in the public service levy, down to a level of 5% or 6% for people on much lower salaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">People are angry and unhappy about it but they recognise that something has to be done to steer the economy back to fiscal stability.  However, that cannot be done when one shoves in people's faces, on a daily basis, more stories about cronies such as Mr. Fingleton and Mr. McCaughey who get away with ridiculous schemes, whereby the little people pay the taxes and the super wealthy can walk away and laugh in our faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The Minister has had enough indication from ourselves and the Fine Gael Party that we are willing to co-operate regarding sacrifices which need to be made to turn around this economy and to rescue it from the state into which he has allowed it fall.  He must, however, do it with justice and fairness.  Justice starts with the wealthy paying and contributing proportionately more because they have proportionately more.  The lower, lighter burdens, if burdens there should be at all, should fall on those people who are least able to bear them.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Every day I read the conventional wisdom for setting out cuts and more cuts, which makes me nervous.  Like Galbraith, I fear the conventional view about cutting, and cutting serves to protect us from the painful job of thinking.  I read many of the orthodox economists with a jaundiced view.  How many of these experts recognised in time that the tax incentives of successive budgets, particularly those of former Deputy Charlie McCreevy post 2001, were in fact our road to ruin and the cause of a flawed construction boom?  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, inherited that and did not have the guts to address it, nor did the incoming Green Party and Fianna Fáil Government after 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">It is clear that the core issue this week and next week will remain, in terms of this country's status and ability to borrow — which we need to do — and the cost of that borrowing, the condition of our banks and their toxic debts.  Right now our economy is being dragged down by our dysfunctional financial system.  Overshadowing everything in the debate is the overhang of the flawed bank guarantee of 30 September last year.  I recall the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, assuring me that his powers under the Act were so great that there was no need to cap the salaries of bank directors at the same level as his salary.  Where is he now?  He is to get a couple of people to report in a month's time.  He is apparently passing on the reform of Ministers, Ministers of State and all such matters to the McCarthy commission.  He is passing on the recovery of Mr. Fingleton's bonus to two directors.  Does this Minister take any direct decisions himself?  Is he just the Minister for passing on decisions to somebody else?</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The decision on the bank guarantee scheme exposed Ireland to a hostile audience among international lenders at a significant additional cost and has restricted our capacity to arrange funds for important capital investment projects which could stimulate the economy.  It has left us with a tattered reputation for crony capitalism, something to which even the Minister had to admit in his meeting with the <i>Financial Times</i> last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">As an Irish person, I was not happy to read the front page headline on the pink newspaper, the <i>Financial Times</i>, stating that the Irish Minister Lenihan wanted to try to clean up Irish crony capitalism.  This was no way to talk about our country on our national day in a financial newspaper which is the most widely read around the world.  It was a sad day for this country to have the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance beating his breast and saying he would try to clean up our crony capitalism.  It has left us with such a tattered reputation that this year the extra interest cost of our borrowing will be approximately €1 billion over the odds because of the rise in the cost of interest payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The bank policy decisions made since September have made a bad situation worse.  I am disappointed that we have received no details of Dr. Bacon's proposals on toxic debts.  It is one final opportunity for the Minister to get a grip on the banking crisis.  He is in the last chance saloon and I urge him to engage with this side of the House before he makes a final decision.  The core issue is the allocation of the bank losses and their debts.  One can talk endlessly about bad banks, good banks, insurance schemes for toxic debts or special companies to handle the debts.  No matter what one chooses, it will still come down to the core issue which is the valuation of the bad debts and how much of a hit the taxpayer will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Done badly, this will probably cost the Irish taxpayer and State €25 billion.  Done well, it could cost us less than half of that.  We have already spent €7 billion recapitalising the two big banks and, as the Minister and the Government knows, it has not worked.  One needs to weigh up all the options, including nationalisation, and I fear the Minister has decided to rule out that option for misguided reasons and, in doing so, has run the risk of loading a grossly excessive and unjustified burden on current and future taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I can see why Mr. Fingleton, Mr. Sheehy and Mr. Boucher are enthusiastic about schemes such as insurance policies.  It should be equally obvious to Members on all sides of the House that this is a bad deal for taxpayers.  Once the crisis is over, the shareholders of the companies which created it will have benefited from a whopping transfer of funds from the Government via the taxpayer.  The public will be appalled by any proposal that involves paying over the odds for assets simply to keep insolvent banks in private hands.  If the Government does this, it will forfeit all claims to an all-party consensus.  There is a well founded suspicion which is denied fervently that the national interest in these decisions is identified solely with the interests of the very people whose wild excesses caused the problems in the first place.  Is the Government the silent spider at the centre of a toxic web of dodgy land deals?  This is what has brought the country down and it remains the issue Fianna Fáil will not confront.  The Government has no right to barter the welfare of the country to protect the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The budgetary process is a type of phoney process, as part of which the Opposition endures a drip feed of information.  The Government must come clean in terms of its target to reduce the budget deficit and how much of the figure it proposes to recover in the five to seven-month period of tax collection after 7 April.  If income tax changes are imposed on 7 April, it will not be possible to implement them, unless they are straightforward levies, until early July.  On the other hand, any excise duty charges can come into force at midnight.  Is the Government proposing to recover a full-year deficit of 9.5% in a five-month timeframe?  This would be akin to the medieval practice of bleeding the patient except that, in this case, the Government will bleed the patient to death because consumers and the general economy will not be able for that degree of harshness.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The economic crisis does not have to be a great depression, as long as the Government makes the correct policy decisions.  The 2009 allocation for the capital programme is €8 billion, of which, we are told, almost €6 million is already committed under contract.  However, an area with one of the highest levels of non-contraction, as far as I can discover, is the schools building programme.  Some €600 million or more is allocated to building and refurbishing schools at primary and secondary level but this allocation is not committed under contract.  If the Government does the budget by rote, the schools building programme which would provide necessary infrastructure and jobs at local level will simply be replaced by a mini-programme.  On the other hand, some Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, are in a position where almost everything in their capital budget is contracted.  As a result, these capital programmes will endure no reduction, whereas the schools building programme will face the chop.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, must be aware that up to €800 million of the capital allocation for transport is not contracted and therefore in peril.  Changes to the capital programme are ill devised and reflect the panic that besets the Government benches as it faces into an emergency budget arising from the mess it has made of a once vibrant economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_418">We must all be grateful to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith,                                                                      for offering us a great insight into the muddled thinking of the Government with his comments last Sunday that savings of €5 billion to €6 billion would be sought in the forthcoming budget.  The subsequent "clarification" hardly helped matters.  Since the beginning of the month the Government has increased the amount of the projected deficit from €4.5 billion to as much as €6 billion.  We must await the March revenue figures which will issue less than a week before the emergency budget to see how much further into the red the Government has dragged the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The economy was brought to this point, not by international factors alone but by the disastrous policies pursued by Fianna Fáil-led Governments for more than a decade.  I acknowledge that international factors have had an impact.  However, these factors would have been mitigated massively had we had constructive, realistic policies guided and driven by a sensible and conscious Government.  It has been claimed no one shouted "Stop".  That is not correct.  Many did so, my Sinn Féin colleagues and me among them.  We pointed out that the property boom was unsustainable and that it was a recipe for disaster for the Government to rely on that bubble for so much of its revenue.  This fundamental policy failure lies at the root of the crisis in the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Last autumn the Government panicked.  It rushed into an emergency early budget in October without having a clear picture of what was happening in the economy.  It was primarily a public relations exercise in order that the Government could be seen to be doing something.  The reality was that the Dáil was in recess for the entire summer.  By contrast, Members of the Spanish Government returned to their desks early in order to deal with the deepening economic crisis in their country.  The October budget was unnecessary and its rushed nature led to more disastrous decisions.  The Government obeyed its conservative reflex and lashed out at public services by imposing cuts in health and education, before imposing a so-called public service pensions levy which is in reality a levy on public service.  The Government succeeded in bringing older people, students and organised workers out in numbers not seen on our streets since the anti-Iraq war march of 2003, the hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981 and the tax marches of 1979.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It was inevitable that these mobilisations would be followed by strike action.  Sinn Féin supports the decision of trade unions and workers to take part in next Monday's national strike.  The blame for industrial unrest lies squarely at the Government's door.  We are calling on the Government to engage with trade unions in an effort to avert the action.  However, if the strike goes ahead as planned, any disruptions will be the responsibility of the Taoiseach and his Government.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, called for the national strike in protest against the Government's handling of the economic crisis.  The ICTU has published a commendable ten-point plan for national recovery — There is a Better, Fairer Way — which sets out the key elements of its campaign platform.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Since the introduction of the so-called "cheapest bail-out in the world", the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has made one blunder after another in his fundamentally flawed strategy to save the banks.  Each time he intervenes, whether through recapitalisation or nationalisation, he tells us that this latest measure will do the job.  While all these schemes have poured billions of euro of taxpayers' money into the banks, our beloved senior bankers are getting away with more embezzlement.  It is simply incredible that while the Government was in the process of guaranteeing Irish Nationwide Building Society, Mr. Michael Fingleton was collecting a bonus of €1 million.  Mr. Fingleton has used Irish Nationwide Building Society for well over 30 years as his own personal bailiwick.  Dominating the board of directors in the way that he did, Mr. Fingleton's €1 million bonus——</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_432">At the very least, it was dubious practice.  Somebody must answer to the House for what was allowed to take place at this institution, into which taxpayers' money was poured.  A number of weeks ago when the evidence of Anglo Irish Bank cooking the books surfaced I called for the Criminal Assets Bureau to investigate that bank.  This evening I call for a CAB investigation of Irish Nationwide Building Society and Mr. Fingleton.  While one scandal after another is surfacing from our corrupt banking institutions there is still no clear evidence that the Government is reforming corporate governance.  It is corporate governance that is crucial in restoring confidence in our banking system.  That can happen only after this mess has been cleared up.  It is now evident that banking institutions without radical intervention are in terminal decline.  If the Government does not intervene in the form of nationalisation, our banks are finished and a number of SMEs and family homes are finished as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The €4.7 billion or possibly €5 billion — it could be €6 billion because the Government obviously does not know — which is being sought will mean nothing if another 300,000 people are laid off by the end of the year, which seems a real prospect at this time.  Because of its obsession with cutbacks and our doomed zombie banks, jobs are being lost and thousand of workers are being cut back to working two days per week.  The Government has basically done nothing to stop this crisis and it seems to be almost suffering from shock.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Yesterday Sinn Féin launched a jobs retention and creation strategy in order to stop the tsunami of unemployment which is sweeping across this country.  We called for a €300 million fund to subsidise jobs in SMEs because our view is that it is better to use public money to keep people at work rather than to keep people at home.  The Taoiseach will need to give serious consideration to State intervention in the private sector to save jobs.  We also need increased investment in our schools and public transport.  A few weeks ago the Government opened up the National Pension Reserve Fund to continue its never-ending bailout of the banks.  Why can it not do something useful for once and use the National Pension Reserve Fund to finance critical infrastructure projects.  Jobs can be created only through investment not through cutbacks.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_435">At the end of February we were presented with catastrophic unemployment figures.  There were then more than 350,000 people out of work and we are losing jobs at a rate of 1,000 per day.  Predictions of more than 500,000 on the dole by Christmas might very well prove to be conservative.  This will mean tens of thousands more families becoming dependent on social welfare.  When I asked the Taoiseach in the Dáil before the St. Patrick's Day recess, and again today, if we would have a new social welfare Bill arising from the supplementary budget, he answered the question in the context of expenditure cuts and revenue raising.  The Taoiseach's replies were an ominous signal that social welfare will be included in expenditure cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Already arising from last October's budget, newly unemployed people have been penalised.  They are now required to have been in employment for two years before qualifying for jobseekers benefit, as against one year before the budget.  The payment period for job seekers benefit has been shortened from 15 months to 12 months, after which the unemployed person must move to the means-tested job seekers allowance.  Newly unemployed people are also facing very long delays before their claims for social welfare payments are assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Low-income families have also suffered disproportionately from VAT increases, health charge increases, the cut in child benefit for 18-year olds and the cut-off of child care supplement at five years of age.  Many of these families still do not qualify for medical cards because the threshold has been allowed to stay at a disgracefully low level.  The Government has been strangely silent on this major issue.  I challenge Government speakers to guarantee in this debate that existing levels of service for medical card holders will not be cut and that those who become qualified for medical cards through unemployment will not be faced with a diminished service after the 7 April budget.  The opportunity for Government speakers to give an answer to that concern is afforded them in the course of these pre-budget statements this evening and tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">In its panic in the lead-in to the unnecessary 14 October budget, the Government lashed out at public services, cutting health and education.  This was followed by public transport cuts with a hypocritical Green Party standing over the attacks on bus services and jobs in Bus Átha Cliath.  These were instinctive acts by a Government that does not value public services for what they are — essential services for our society and economy — but sees them as goodies to be doled out when the revenue figures allow.  The Government must ring-fence social expenditure to support all those who are on the threshold of poverty.  Revenue must be raised through taxing those who can afford to pay, through eliminating waste in public expenditure and through job retention and job creation — the most critical element that the Government has failed to grasp so far.  We need a real and effective employment strategy and it is glaringly absent from Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">With regard to job retention, we need only look at the scandal of SR Technics to see how the Government has failed to be proactive and has allowed a big multinational company to take over the operation and then force it to close, even though it is a very viable business.  The owners of SR Technics are mostly oil billionaires based in the United Arab Emirates.  They have no interest in or knowledge of Ireland.  They want to close the Dublin operation because their long-term plan is for a massive aircraft repair facility in Dubai.  Yet what has the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment done?  She has allowed IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to refer directly to the owners of SR Technics all potential investors who have expressed interest in taking over the company or parts of it.  As the workers have pointed out, it is they and the local management in Ireland who are the real stakeholders in SR Technics.  Their plan for the survival of the company should be fully supported by Government and the Tánaiste should instruct IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work directly with workers who are the real resource at SR Technics.  These jobs can be saved and I urge the Government to act effectively towards that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">We in Sinn Féin have pointed the way with our ‘Time for Action' proposals, including an employment fund to help struggling viable businesses to retain their workers.  This is far preferable to allowing people to be added to the ever-lengthening dole queues.  I urge the Government to take on board our proposals.  I urge it also to take on board the constructive proposals of the trade union movement and I commend trade unionists on their campaigning for a better way forward.  Workers are now being vilified in some sections of the media for preparing to take strike action next Monday.  I am also aware that pressure is being placed on some workers in advance of that, which is outrageous.  Workers have the right to make a democratic decision and to follow through in line with that trade union decision making process.  We need to remember, however, that this strike is in opposition to the disastrous policies of the Government and in support of the better and fairer way forward that is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I hope that from the collective of contributions in the course of these statements this evening and tomorrow the Government will take note and act in accordance with the commonsense proposals and ideas suggested.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who is the sole Minister or Minister of State on the Government benches, I hope the Government will take heed and note of the contributions of Opposition voices over the course of these two days.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, SR Technics is slap bang in the middle of my constituency, in Swords in north Dublin.  I assure the Deputy it is not true that the Government is not being effective in trying to examine every avenue it possibly can, across the parties.  With regard to the Joint Committee on Transport and a meeting of colleagues from Dublin North and adjoining constituencies, all of us, regardless of party, are doing our level best to ensure we save as many of those jobs in what I agree is an absolutely viable company that we need to do everything possible to save.  I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have been involved on a daily basis with regard to SR Technics.  I remain quietly confident we can step back from the brink on this matter and retain many of the jobs in SR Technics.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I am pleased to be given the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the upcoming budget of 7 April.  The Government has rightly taken the decision to introduce a supplementary budget.  The challenge we now have is to set the balance between cutting spending and raising taxes, on one hand, and not over-taxing the economy, on the other.  The worsening Exchequer returns discussed earlier today mean the Government needs to act now to further address the situation and to bridge the gap between Government income and expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">We have taken very difficult decisions in recent months, many of which are understandably not popular, particularly with those who have been directly affected in their pockets.  However, every decision taken by the Government has been in the interest of the country as a whole and for Ireland's future economic prosperity.  The cornerstone of this budget and our economic strategy has to be that we get the public finances in order, continue to sort out the banking situation, protect and create jobs and, most importantly, do all we can to support the thousands of people who have lost their jobs in the past eight months in particular and get them back into viable employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The global economic situation has led to a severe loss in confidence and a drastic decrease in the public finances which needs to be addressed.  In doing so, however, we must remember from where we have come.  As I stand here today, more than 1.8 million people are at work in Ireland, nearly double the number at work only 20 years ago.  This budget must ensure we do everything in our power to protect current jobs and to continue to attract foreign direct investment to grow jobs in areas where we have been successful, such as the pharmaceutical and technology sectors.  It is important to state that in 2008 alone more than €4 billion of foreign direct investment was secured in the research and development sector.  I put it to Members that much of this is directly related to Government policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">To protect jobs and create new jobs, we must ensure our cost base is competitive.  While I welcome the recent reductions in energy prices for homeowners and businesses, we must do more in this area to reduce costs further.  We must continue to reduce red tape for business, thereby reducing administration and the costs associated with it.  We must continue to work to ensure businesses have access to lines of credit to keep them in business through these difficult times.  This was one of the cornerstones of our decision in regard to the capitalisation of the two main banks and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I welcome the recent announcement by the Taoiseach of the establishment of the €100 million fund for viable and vulnerable businesses.  This scheme needs to be brought through quickly in the budget and needs to be expanded upon.  We should retain our competitive edge in regard to the area of corporation tax, where we should retain the 12.5% rate.  Any increase in this rate would be a retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The budget also provides an opportunity for stimulus.  It will be not just about cuts and taxes but must be also about stimulating the economy.  One of the tragedies of this recession has been the thousands of people who have lost their jobs.  A priority within the upcoming budget must be to help those who are unemployed regain employment and to continue to assist them financially while they are out of work.  The recent announcement by Hewlett Packard clearly shows that Ireland continues to be a place for multinationals to invest and to create jobs that can be filled by very well qualified people who have recently lost their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">This budget will be tough but it also will be fair.  The Taoiseach has said that those who can bear the burden best will bear it most.  The overriding principle of this budget must be one of fairness.  The general public know that we are in the midst of the worst global financial crisis since 1929.  Ireland, as an open economy within Europe, is not immune to this crisis and has in some areas suffered worse than some of our neighbours.  However, we have the ability to come through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I firmly agree that we need to continue to invest through our national development plan to improve both our physical and social infrastructure.  It is right that we will spend in excess of €650 million this year in providing new schools and refurbishing existing ones.  It is also right that we will spend 5% of GNP in the coming year, double the European average, in making sure we are investing in Ireland and retaining jobs.  We need to ensure that in all of these projects we get value for money.  We must continue to examine Government expenditure across all Departments.  Any budget changes must be seen in the context of zero inflation.  Increases which we have seen in the past number of budgets will not be seen this year but I would ask all parties and commentators to be fair in their assessment of the budget proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Dáil should take the lead in considering how it can reduce costs.  It is now time to bring forward changes to pension arrangements within the Dáil.  I agree with many others that former Ministers across all parties should not draw a pension while serving in the Oireachtas.  I ask here this evening that changes be made in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I know many public servants still feel aggrieved with the pensions levy, on which I spoke in the House, but I still believe it was the fairest approach.  It was also right that the impact of the levy was felt by Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">One area in which I take a particular interest is that of pensions.  In 2007, €2.9 billion was allowed in tax relief on both private and public sector pensions.  There has been much comment in the media about what changes should be made in this area.  I would not like to see a change to the system that would mean a reduction in tax relief, allowing it only at the standard rate.  This would be a retrograde, short-term step that would do nothing to bridge the gap between people who do not have adequate pension provision and those who do.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The area of directors' pensions needs to be examined in great detail.  A disproportionate amount of tax relief is paid to company directors who can roll up their salaries for pension purposes in the ten years prior to retirement and benefit greatly from corporation tax relief and the reduction in capital gains tax liability.  I have sent proposals to Government on this matter and I personally would reduce the maximum allowable fund from €5 million to €3 million, thereby reducing the tax free cash amount that is payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I genuinely hope — I have noticed a change in this regard in the past couple of weeks — that all parties within the Opposition will present viable proposals for this budget and not just disagree with Government proposals for the sake of it.  I welcome many of the proposals I have seen from the Opposition parties in recent weeks.  This is the forum in which to discuss them and I ask the Opposition to look in detail at the budget proposals and take them on their merits.  It is clear, based on the Exchequer returns, that further measures are needed to ensure we remain within the 9.5% of GDP target agreed with the European Commission as part of the plan for the stabilisation of the public finances.  It is only right and proper that this be done in the interests of the country.  I know these decisions are tough and not all of them will be immediately welcomed by the public.  However, in time, people will see they have been necessary to ensure the future prosperity of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Government will continue to work on areas where we can stimulate growth, protect those currently at work and ensure our policies in regard to tax and savings are fair and balanced.  The Government will not shirk its responsibility to its citizens.  I know people will recognise that these decisions, while difficult, have been taken for the good of the country as a whole and for our future generations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_457">I am delighted to contribute to this debate, although I find it frustrating that the Minister for Finance did not come into the House to open it.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Deputy O'Brien made a number of points with which I would like to deal.  If we are to have a proper discourse on the budget, we need full information.  The Government cannot simply tell us it is considering proposals which, it appears, we will not see until budget day.  We have sought the provision of meaningful information by the Department and Minister for Finance.  For example, what are the monthly tax projections for the remainder of the year and what is their basis?  What proposals have been made by various Departments?  Meaningful discussion and dialogue on the budget is a two-way street.  We have, through our spokesperson, Deputy Bruton, written to the Minister requesting these details which have not been forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">A number of key factors require to be addressed in the budget, including the restoration to order of the public finances, an issue on which I will speak further.  The abiding feeling among the general public in terms of the budget is fear.  People are afraid of what will be contained in the budget.  They have suffered cut after cut, following previous announcements by the Government.  The Government, when it should have taken a proper approach in the budget announced last October, fudged it.  People are fearful and finding it difficult to keep up with mortgage and car loan repayments.  The Government needs to give an indication that it is in control and that there is a methodology in what it is doing.  The public understands we are in great difficulty in terms of the public finances but they see no economic plan or road map from the Government.  The abiding feeling among the public is fear.  They are worried that further cuts will be announced.  Also, the budget will have to be seen to be fair across all areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Fine Gael has tabled a Private Members' motion which proposes a reduction in the number of Ministers of State from 20 to eight.  Leadership must be provided from the top.  Also, we have proposed reform of the committee system, changes to the residency rules and across a range of areas, including the banking sector.  In the past few days there have been two important announcements, including on the €1 million bonus paid to the CEO of Irish Nationwide Building Society following the introduction of the Government's guarantee scheme.  I draw Members attention to paragraph 8 of the guarantee scheme which states the Minister may review and vary the terms and conditions of the scheme from time to time at no later than six monthly intervals.  I take the opportunity to point out to the Minister that the first six month period will expire at the end of March and that he should use the opportunity to apply this provision to what is happening in Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Paragraph 48 of the guarantee scheme states each covered institution shall submit a report to the CIROC no later than six weeks after the relevant covered institution joins the scheme, demonstrating how its remuneration policy for the year ahead will comply with the overall merits of the scheme.  How did it arise that Mr. Fingleton was able to take a €1 million bonus after the scheme was introduced?  The money must be repaid.  The payment of this bonus sends the wrong signal to ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">We also heard today of issues relating to tax avoidance on the part of another individual.  While it might be suggested the amount of money involved is not huge, that is not the point.  A tax system, if it is to work, must be fair.  In recent months low to middle income earners have had to pay a 1% income levy.  Those working in the public sector are also paying a pension levy of between 3% and 10%.  Side by side others who have made a great deal of money are not paying their taxes.  There must be radical change in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">In restoring financial stability we need to know what the Government is proposing to do in terms of the general deficit and how much it proposes to borrow in the current year.  It has not to date stated its intentions in this regard.  It has been given five years by the European Union to restore the public finances to order.  With the public, we are entitled to know what it proposes to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Credibility must be restored to the banking sector.  Currently, it is not giving credit to small business.  The Government is pumping €7 billion of taxpayers' money into the two main banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, which we believe cannot and will not work.  The fact that the banks have toxic debts means they will require further funds in the next year.  Fine Gael has brought forward a model which is gaining approval in various quarters which we believe would be tenable and viable, namely, that two new good banks be established and that the two existing banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, effectively remain as currently constituted but as debt management agencies.  This would allow the new banks to trade.  I would support the Government in putting funds into these new banks because it would at least be investing in something viable from which funds would flow.  Currently, funds are not flowing to small business.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The Government and banking sector issues are interlinked.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will agree with me on the following point.  Currently, Ireland is paying 2.75% above the rate paid by Germany in borrowing on the international market.  The reason for this is a lack of credibility in how the Government is looking after the economy.  Credibility must be restored.  Implicit in this is that the Government will deal with banking sector issues.  If we do not resolve these issues, it will be extremely difficult for the economy to recover from the recession.  Hard decisions need to be made and proper regulation provided for to ensure CEOs such as Mr. Michael Fingleton cannot take a €1 million bonus at a time when taxpayers earning between €20,000 and €40,000 per annum are bailing out Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This defies logic; it is immoral.  The Government must make a stand on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Job retention and creation are vital.  We must ensure the live register statistics do not continue to tumble in a downward spiral.  More than 100,000 have joined the live register since last November.  We must find radical ways to ensure people retain their jobs.  If they can, they will be able to continue to pay their mortgages and car loans and for their children's education.  Currently, approximately 1,000 a day are losing their jobs.  I cannot understand the Government's lack of urgency in this regard.  It has stumbled from issue to issue and from budget to budget without making the required decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">We must become competitive as a nation.  We began to lose our competitiveness in 2003 when our exports began to fall and the Government put all it had into the construction sector.  It knew this was unsustainable.  The Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, having been told by the Central Bank, the IMF and others that the economy was sound, continued to build.  Most of that building was undertaken on the basis of funds borrowed abroad by the banks which we are now repaying.  Most of that building was done on the basis of foreign debt — money the banks had to borrow — that we are now repaying.  That money is going out of the Irish economy at the moment.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, comes into the Chamber tomorrow night——</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Exactly.  I hope he will set out an honest and reasonable plan with which we can work.  If that happens, he will see a spirit of co-operation.  So far in this debate, all those on the Government benches have done is play politics.  We want to be able to work together.  That will not be possible if information is not exchanged openly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_469">I welcome the opportunity to speak during this pre-budget debate.  This is an opportune time for Deputies from all parties on the Government and Opposition sides of the House to make a major statement about how Ireland will tackle the difficulties it is encountering during this period of global economic unrest.  It is fair to say that the work done by the Taoiseach in the United States last week was excellent.  Everybody in the State was proud of the ease with which the Taoiseach was accepted when he met the US President, Mr. Obama, in the White House.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The Government has been reasonably steadfast in setting out its plans for dealing with the ongoing crisis in the economy.  It took an approach to the banking crisis from day one.  In fairness, it took the lead when it provided a guarantee to this country's financial institutions.  The action taken at that stage has stood the test of time.  Nobody can criticise the stance taken by the Taoiseach or by the Minister for Finance when they provided a guarantee of that nature.  As the global financial situation continues to change on a daily basis, it is clear that no single solution will assist every economy.  Having said that, we need to examine all the problems we face and deal with them.  Rather than reacting to every little issue that comes along, it is only proper that an appropriate statement is made at an opportune time.  That time is now, as we approach next month's budget.  The Government has had a constant plan from the outset.  Its efforts to attack the gap in the public finances are ongoing.  While the recent pension levy was difficult to implement, I am glad the Government took a strong stance.  Every Deputy on this side had to take the rap when it was being introduced.  A great deal of false information was disseminated by the media, fuelled by certain unions that failed to give proper or up-to-date information to their members.  If we are to overcome this financial crisis, the unions need to act in a much more co-operative manner.  They did not put their shoulder to the wheel when the pension levy was being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The Government's plan also involves sorting out the banks, which is no easy task.  We are aware of some of the discrepancies that have developed in recent months.  Time will show that the Government has the right plan of attack in this regard.  It has done everything possible to create and save jobs.  In the current climate, Ireland is no different from any other economy.  We are very open to foreign direct investment.  We are doing particularly well, given the climate we are in.  Perhaps that is a bold statement, but that is how I feel about it.  It is not an easy time to be Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  When one considers the financial constraints on other countries, it is clear it is not easy to maintain jobs in the Irish economy.  Great work has been done to create and save jobs.  We should not forget that jobs are being created and more jobs are in the pipeline.  It should not be all doom and gloom day in, day out.  Much work is being done behind the scenes to protect and support the unemployed.  The Government is restoring Ireland's international reputation by strengthening domestic governance arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">If there is a message I would like to send to the Opposition, it is that it is time for us to stand together in advance of the forthcoming budget.  If the economy is to get where it needs to be, we will all have to put our shoulders behind the wheel.  I do not believe that has been happening in recent times.  I have not seen any signs of it.  Some of the proposals made by the Opposition in this week's Private Members' motion are futile and unimaginative.  The best it has come up with is an attack on the number of Ministers of State and the extent of the supports available to Ministers and Ministers of State.  To choose such easy targets is gombeen politics, as far as I am concerned.  People who have been elected to this House should be far more constructive, in the interests of the good of the people.  We all know this is the worst crisis to hit this country for many decades.  Party politics should be left outside for a few weeks, if possible, for the good of the country.  Deputies should start making proper proposals to help those who elect them.  The recent petty calls for a general election were crazy.  Before Christmas, some members of the Opposition did not want an election.  They were probably afraid of it.  They might have thought they would be better off if the election were delayed by a year.  However, this week they have called for a snap general election.  It is time for Members of this House to think about what we say rather than jumping to a conclusion this week and another conclusion next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The fundamentals of the economy are still strong.  That is probably what is saving us.  We need to recognise that many economies of a similar size are in a much worse position than the Irish economy.  Stimulus packages, such as the national development plan, are helping to keep jobs in the economy.  I do not ignore the fact that many jobs are being lost every week, which is a pattern that will continue for some time.  It is worth recognising that matters would be much worse if we did not have the forms of economic stimulus that are currently available, such as the national development plan.  All Deputies are aware that significant moneys have been spent on building and upgrading roads across the country.  Substantial funds have been pumped into our motorways and our regional and county roads in recent years.  That is continuing to more or less the same degree.  The development of new school buildings and extensions in the past ten years has been phenomenal.  Schools have benefited from many additional resource assistants.  Work is ongoing to extend hospitals across the country.  The health service is being reformed.  The consultant contract that has been introduced, which was controversial in some ranks when it was agreed by the Minister and the consultants, will go a long way towards reforming our health service.  I look forward to the completion of the review of outpatient services.  It is important, for once and for all, that consultants will be able to deal with outpatients as they come along.  It is farcical that doctors who are not consultants are currently dealing with outpatients.  That is largely the reason there are long queues at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Contract thresholds is the last issue I want to raise.  I raised this matter today with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm, and it applies right across the board in Departments.  In any Government tender process there is a European Union stipulation whereby when a contractor prices for a job, his or her previous year's turnover must be two or three times the cost of the job.  Gone is the day when a bond was good enough to secure a contract.  That leaves us with the situation where only large companies can tender for these jobs, with the result that all small local contractors are ruled out.  I refer to the boys who over the years did jobs such as school and hospital extensions.  Such jobs are not rocket science or very technical.  I have an engineering background and I know what I am talking about.  It is time we reviewed that tender threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I have every confidence in the Minister, and in the Government and the Taoiseach, to make the right decisions next week.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_476">If it were not so serious, it would be laughable to listen to one Government speaker after another ask us to put party politics behind us and to support their budget.  They did not give us any information.  When my colleague Deputy Bruton wrote to the Minister asking for information in order that we could make helpful suggestions on the budget, he did not even get the courtesy of a reply, much less the kind of information we would need to make any kind of meaningful input.  We did not get projections for revenue over the year or specific or general information about the kind of options available.  That is not to say the Government does not need our help.  After all, this is the fourth budget in 12 months.  It certainly does need our help.  This is the Government's last chance.  It has barely seven months to implement the kind of measures that will stabilise the national finances.  The Government needs our help because this time it must get it right.  This is its third attempt in the past six months and it must get it right this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The markets demand that the Government gets it right.  They have seen the blind eye turned to our banking regulation.  Some people call it soft touch, others call it blind-eye regulation.  They have seen our bankers' disregard for shareholders and depositors, for any kind of prudential behaviour, and for legal, not to mention moral, considerations.  They have seen our economic instability, the yawning gap the Government has allowed emerge between revenue and expenditure, and they have seen the Government's bank guarantee.  They must now be asking how a Government, on its third budget in six months, its fourth in 12 months, could make good that guarantee if it were called upon to do so.  The markets have seen the money already committed to the banks, not just in the guarantee but in the nationalisation and in the recapitalisation, and they must wonder at the Government's ability to meet all of those debts when already the yield on Government bonds is twice that in Germany.  This gives us an indication of the view of international markets of the Government's credit worthiness.  That view of Ireland is what this budget must change.  We are in the last chance saloon and the Government must show its determination to stabilise borrowing, at least, in this budget, and to do so at a time when, unfortunately, the Exchequer is already on its knees in terms of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">When every other country is implementing stimulus packages — some are taking breathtaking decisions in that regard — we, because of the mismanagement of funds, are planning to take billions out of our economy — €6 billion, if we are to believe the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith.  When demand is down, when consumers have finally zipped up their wallets and discretionary spending has virtually ceased and when confidence is on the ground, although we know the normal response in such circumstances is that Government fiscal policy should lean against the business cycle, we must do the exact opposite simply because of the bad management of finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Nobody on this side of the House denies that the challenge is enormous.  It will be difficult to strike a balance between the interventions needed to sustain demand and jobs, on the one hand, and allowing the necessary structural adjustments to take place so that real recovery and new jobs can begin to be formed, on the other.  It will be difficult to strike a balance between reducing the revenue gap and at the same time incentivise economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The misery and the pain is inevitable for everybody, not just for the 100,000 people who have lost their jobs in the past 12 months but for all of those who are still lucky enough to be in employment.  The only question is whether it will be short and sharp, or measured in decades.  That will be the effective outcome of this budget.  That is what this budget will decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Short-term but time-limited measures, such as PRSI holidays for distressed companies to keep people in employment, are vital.  Also vital are reforms of how the Government does its business, of how it regulates the private sector, and of how it has protected monopolies and special interests.  All those long-term structural changes must come as part of this budget in tandem with the taxes and the short-term measures, or we will simply prolong the misery for everybody, and that will be this Government's legacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">In the absence of specific information about what the options are, how much they would cost and how much money we will have available, I want to make some general remarks about specific issues.  Several Deputies spoke about the need to sustain jobs, and specifically about the building industry.  We heard today — although the Deputies who spoke obviously have not heard — that all public projects that have not been contracted for are on hold or stopped.  What is the sense of this move which will effectively wipe out the entire building industry, all its suppliers and all of the 280,000 jobs which are left in it?  Home building is gone and will remain so for a number of years.  No matter what people say, the reality is the overhang in inventory is enormous.  There is negative equity for many people.  That sector will not be revitalised any time soon and it is up to the Government to ensure that infrastructural work continues and some of that slack is taken up.  The truth is it was the absence of infrastructure that pushed up costs during the years of the Celtic tiger and the Government will make the same mistake again in failing to create the conditions for future growth at a time when tender prices will never be as low.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The industry has made the point that the real cost of providing finance for these projects is just a fraction of the nominal cost when taxes forgone and social welfare payments are taken into account.  In the roads programme, which is only one aspect of infrastructure, we will lose the expertise that has been amassed and the momentum that has been gained.  We will perhaps lose it forever because architects, engineers and all of those with skill sets honed over the past number of years are disappearing out of the country every day.  The reality is we will be left with the fixed costs.  For example, we will have all the engineers in every local authority around the country and we will have the NRA staff.  One may say what one likes about what is happening in many local areas, but the NRA has been one of the most efficient agencies in the country and it has delivered what it set out to do.  It will be left now with nothing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The schools that need to be built and all of the other infrastructure that needs to be built can be done now at a fraction of the cost when the economy is growing again.  Deputy O'Brien stated there is €600 million to be spent on schools.  That is not the case; it has been put on hold.  It has been stopped.  Those projects are not contracted for.  They are stopped.  Deputy Blaney spoke about the roads programme.  It is stopped.  There is no roads programme.  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The industry has suggested the reform of the public private partnership because it simply is not working.  It is convoluted, bureaucratic and expensive, but it offers an opportunity to provide infrastructure by taking it off balance sheet, although perhaps not for the roads programme because all of the tolled roads have been built.  There is not an opportunity for tolls in the future, but there is certainly an opportunity for commercial undertakings.  There is certainly an opportunity to postpone expenditure if we opt for the design, finance and build.  That must be considered if we are to save some of the jobs.  Turning off the tap completely is lunacy for a Government which must be concerned about maintaining jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The motor trade has had many good years but businesses are one-by-one going to the wall, with all the loss of jobs that entails.  I do not want any special deal for them but I want the Government to examine, as requested, the nonsense of the claw-back system on VAT whereby they pay VAT on their losses.  That is an oxymoron and makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I want the Government to spend money in one other area, that of the Protestant faith schools.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh is aware, the decision to cut their funding reneges on a 40 year decision and I ask the Government to examine it.  The outcome is that many Protestant children will no longer be able to avail of a Protestant education.  We already know that in September children will be taken out of schools because their parents cannot support the fees without that grant.  It is not an exaggeration to say this measure, notwithstanding that it is a very small amount of money, will devastate the Protestant community.  I do not say it will impact on Protestant faith numbers in the short term but fragmenting their community in this way will create such a long-term effect.  I ask the Government to take the opportunity of this budget to reverse that decision, which it will regret.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_488">The global recession has severely affected Ireland as a small open economy.  It gives me no joy to have to say that.  It is sad, but factual that we find ourselves in a very serious situation.  Unemployment is rising, many people in the private sector have taken wage cuts and people are extremely worried about their future and their children's future.  This recession has been compared by some to the depression in the 1930s.  We find ourselves globally in the worst situation since 1929.  Clearly there are similarities.  The main difference is that this time it is global.  Every country and every sector of the economy is affected.  It is no exaggeration to say we are living in extraordinary times.  Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">A supplementary budget is necessary to restore this country's public finances.  It is evident that our public finances have deteriorated rapidly since October.  This year it is estimated that there will be a €20 billion deficit in the public finances.  The Government must curb public spending to plug this gap.  We cannot continue to spend and borrow, and saddle our children with a lifetime of debt.  That is why the Government is making tough and unpopular decisions to restore the country's public finances and our international reputation.  We are doing what is in the best interests of the country to best position ourselves for when the upturn comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Some commentators have berated the Government for what they perceive as a lack of stimulus packages.  Yet, next week will see the launch of the national insulation programme, which will provide householders with reduced energy costs while providing work for construction workers all over the country.  Likewise the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe has provided €680 million for the schools building programme.  The combination of these investments is expected to provide 10,000 jobs this year.  All national road projects at the planning stage will be reviewed and reprioritised so that those projects that support the most jobs will be built first.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Last December the Government launched its document "Building Ireland's Smart Economy".  This sets out our roadmap for Ireland's move back to growth and prosperity over the next five years.  Competitiveness is clearly an issue.  It is key to sustaining employment.  The depreciation of sterling against the euro has had a severe impact on Irish exports.  Cost competitiveness remains critical to ensuring companies based in Ireland have the ability to compete successfully in international markets.  It is vital if we are to continue to attract foreign direct investment.  In 2008 foreign direct investment resulted in the creation of 9,000 jobs.  Enterprise Ireland continues to provide a range of supports for high-potential start up companies, including financial supports, business and market intelligence, mentoring, innovation and research and development.  More than 10,500 new jobs were created in Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Every day brings more stories of redundancies and pay cuts.  Behind these statistics there are hardworking men, women and families who are lying awake wondering how they are going to survive.  We are committed to helping these people find jobs.  This year FÁS will provide an extra 51,000 places under traineeships programmes for job-changers or those who are unemployed.  This year the 35 city and county enterprise boards will receive funding of €34 million.  This will enable the boards to be actively involved in economic development and will ensure available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Investment is also coming from the European Union.  Earlier this month the EU Commissioner for Regional Development announced that €105 billion will be invested in the green economy through the EU cohesion policy.  Ireland will benefit from over €153 million in funding which will cover transport, environment, energy management and regeneration schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I have touched on three out of four of the Government's cornerstones for recovery: getting public finances in order, sorting out the banking situation, protecting and creating jobs and looking after those who have lost jobs.  There is a strategy in place.  By taking the tough decisions now Ireland will recover and return to prosperity.  There is no magic bullet.  A variety of economic measures have been introduced in countries around the world to deal with the banking and economic crisis.  There is no magic solution.  It will take patience and decisive decision making to restore stability and confidence.  We are living in extraordinary times.  The Government has its work cut out, but the introduction of a supplementary budget is an important step to restoring prosperity in the medium to long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Yesterday my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke and I met the midland branch of the Carers Association of Ireland to discuss the forthcoming budget on 7 April.  We realise that carers give their lives to caring for the elderly, infirm and disabled in their homes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_496">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_497">"—That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_498">recognising the unnecessary expansion of the numbers of Ministers of State in 2007;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_499">mindful of the need to reform and upgrade the way that Government undertakes its work on behalf of the people; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_500">understanding the need for the Oireachtas and the Government to be seen to lead by example in the current economic crisis facing the country;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_501">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_502">reduce the number of Ministers of State by eight, from twenty to twelve; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_503">reduce the ministerial staff allocated to work on constituency matters to two per Minister."</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I wish to share time with Deputies Shatter, Clune and D'Arcy.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Following the 2007 general election, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, decided to provide a few additional posts of responsibility as Ministers of State and committee chairmen to members of his party.  People were mindful that this had happened previously but, nevertheless, the economic climate warranted political leadership in making the Oireachtas more cost effective and effective in parliamentary terms.  This is about saving taxpayers' money and making Ireland competitive in order that people can keep their jobs.  It is about fairness in order that the matters about which the House must come to conclusions in the next few weeks can be seen to be taken in the context of fairness by public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">In 2007, the number of Ministers of State was increased from 17 to 20 but nobody could understand the gaping hole in policy by which the increase was justified nor could anybody see the justification for additional committees and posts of responsibility because sufficient committees were appointed to do the same volume of work in the previous Dáil.  Why did the then Taoiseach do that with the approval of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen?  The only conclusion one can come to is he had to appease the unease in his parliamentary party to ensure members had posts of responsibility and were working hard on behalf of the people and, therefore, were not too concerned about the deterioration in the nation's finances and increasing unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The three newly appointed Ministers of State were scattered throughout various Departments.  For example, at a time when the Health Service Executive is not even accountable to the House, the Department of Health and Children has four Ministers of State, one with responsibility for children and youth affairs, another with responsibility for health promotion and food safety, another with responsibility for older people and the fourth with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health.  It is difficult to justify four Ministers of State for a Department that has abdicated responsibility and for which the Minister is not accountable to the House for the bulk of its budget.  It is reasonable to ask what the Ministers of State do.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has three Ministers of State with another Minister of State who deals with issues cutting across multiple Departments.  Four Ministers are, therefore, in the House for Question Time dealing with labour affairs, trade and commerce and science, technology and innovation.   The roles and responsibilities of some of the Ministers of State in these areas are justified but not to the extent provided for in this Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Fine Gael wants to know whether we need the current number of Ministers of State and whether the number can be reduced to ensure effective administration.  Currently, responsibilities allocated to such Ministers are ineffective and unnecessary.  The junior Ministers are entitled to their salaries but their offices cost a significant sum when support staff are taken into account.  Senior Ministers have 33 staff assigned to them to deal with constituency work while the number assigned to Ministers of State is 85.  Whey would a Minister of State require additional posts of responsibility for people to do constituency work when senior Ministers, who receive more correspondence, including from their parliamentary colleagues, require only 33 officials to address constituency business?</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The cost of the staff of senior Ministers is €3.616 million while the cost of the staff of Ministers of State is €8.2 million.  That requires examination.  Fine Gael believes the average cost of the office of a Minister of State is €750,000 annually but only 12, not 20, Ministers of State are required.  Each Department does not need a Minister of State assigned to it.  Given the responsibilities of Ministers and the busy lives they lead, cover must be provided at various events and functions and for departmental and parliamentary responsibilities.  Delegating responsibilities to a Minister of State is essential if we want to ensure the Cabinet system works effectively and well on behalf of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I concede a Government Chief Whip is needed to ensure the parliamentary affairs of the State are overseen.  A Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs is required given the large number of meetings on European issues.  However, I am not sure Ministers of State with responsibility for lifelong learning and the Information Society are needed.  Other people could cover these areas over a cup of coffee judging by the throughput we have witnessed.  What does "local services" mean in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  Rationalisation is easy to accomplish in the Department of Health and Children which has four Ministers of State who have no responsibility for the largest budget in the State.  This is given to the HSE, which is not even accountable to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The motion is intended as a catalyst to discuss the various issues in which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been interested since Christmas.  He has been talking out loud about the need for parliamentary reform and the way the political class must show leadership on this matter.  Three weeks ago, he stated, "It is now time for all of the political parties in Dáil Éireann to play their part.  They need to lead by example and show those people currently feeling the pain that the political class will play its part".  That is a noble statement by a Minister whose party is a partner in government with Fianna Fáil.  I am sure he has influence over decisions made at the Cabinet table.  Why is he in government otherwise?</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Minister could at any time decide to make this a major issue but he has chosen not to do so to date.  All we have from him is rhetoric with no indication that he is serious about electoral reform because he has not even set up the electoral commission, which was promised in the programme for Government in 2007.  We are on the verge of local and European elections.  We were told an electoral commission would be in place to oversee them as a trial run before the next general election but there is no sign of any change.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill before the House is the epitome of the failure of the Minister to initiate and implement a programme of electoral reform.  The net point of the legislation is how many days are required before posters can be erected prior to polling day.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">If that is the best that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, can do I would not like to see the end result in the White Paper on local government reform.  This was promised for before the end of 2008 but we have not yet seen it although we are on the verge of European and local elections.  Those who will be elected to local government on 5 June do not know in advance what the Minister has in mind and have no programme of legislation or policy devolved to local government that will give them any meaningful involvement in the affairs of their communities.  It is business as usual, as the Taoiseach said recently about the economy and Anglo Irish Bank.  It is business as usual too for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  We will hear a great deal but will see no action on his genuine concerns about reforming this House, having a leaner and more effective administration and devolving real power to communities through their local government system, in the form of a White Paper on local government.  I look forward to the proposals but I do not think I will see much meat on them between now and 5 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Tonight's Fine Gael motion gives the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and others like him, an opportunity to reflect on their rhetoric and take action tomorrow night by voting with the Opposition on some of our proposals.  It is not a comprehensive package of electoral reform but a small item that will make a meaningful contribution to showing the public that we are serious about becoming more effective and making Departments leaner for the times we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I was heartened to see that many staff are allocated in various ways in Departments but I know now why Ministers and Ministers of State have been so busy doing constituency work since Christmas.  They have enormous resources and contributions that people on this side of the House would love to have.  We do a reasonable job with a parliamentary assistant and a secretarial assistant.  Why not let everyone have the same resources to look after their constituencies?  They would do it effectively and well.  There is no reason that any Ministers or Ministers of State who have significant backup, apart from constituency office staff in their Departments, cannot do their personal constituency work with two people in their constituency offices.  That is a reasonable suggestion, instead of Ministers of State having an average of eight staff doing their constituency office work.  Ministers of State have a total staff of 189, at an annual cost of €8.24 million, while Ministers have a staff of 78 at a cost of €3.6 million.  If an bord snip nua examines how this House does its business, those proposals speak for themselves in favour of rationalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">We have heard too many promises from this and previous Governments about the need to carry out parliamentary reform.  Deputies Stagg and Stanton, and others, have been to the fore in contributing to that debate but it is up to the Government to bring forward proposals to make this Chamber represent the electorate more effectively.  Some of its procedures are so archaic and out of date that reform is urgently needed.  People demand and expect this of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, has a legitimate and genuine interest in how this House conducts its business.  In his response to this motion he might flesh out how we can have meaningful Dáil reform, with accountability from quangos, some of which we do not need, and from Ministers of State in terms of the effectiveness of their responsibilities in these financial circumstances, and also what committees we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Committees are necessary to shadow the Departments.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which sat today for 90 minutes to discuss the social housing programme.  We could not spend that much time in plenary session here doing such detailed work.  Committees are important but we do not need all of them.  After the last general election many were established for political convenience rather than for the work they might do.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">While some people need remuneration for their work, Members of this House can take their responsibilities seriously by being chairmen, vice-chairmen or convenors of committees without remuneration.  It is a great honour and privilege to represent one's constituency here and to be asked to take on such a responsibility by the Houses of the Oireachtas and one's party.  People would look forward to that additional responsibility and to getting stuck into work they would not have the opportunity to do as an ordinary Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I suggest that there is an opportunity to have a meaningful debate about how we do our business, the number of people we need to do it and how we can be a more effective Parliament and Government.  We do not need as many Ministers of State.  Government Members, particularly those in the Green Party, will have the opportunity to vote with the Opposition tomorrow night in favour of reducing the Ministers of State from 20 to 12, and the number of ministerial constituency office staff to two.  That would be a start in showing whether they are genuine about meeting the objectives about which we have recently heard so much rhetoric from the Minister, Deputy Gormley.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_522">I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan for tabling this motion.  The way Members vote on it tomorrow will be a litmus test of the sincerity of Members on all sides who have rushed at every available media opportunity to talk about the need for Dáil reform.  We do not have 20 Ministers of State because the country needs them.  They are a tribute to the inventiveness of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in ensuring that as many members of his parliamentary party as possible received positions.  It was not a case of creating positions that were needed or performing necessary functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">While 20 is the maximum number of Ministers of State that any Government could appoint, we do not need 20.  Twelve is a reasonable number to meet all the requirements to ensure that Government runs properly, but we could manage with fewer than 12.  I do not want any of the Ministers of State to take my comments personally because I am sure they are all decent people.  It is not their fault they have been given their titles, although I am not aware of any who refused them.  The calls for Dáil reform by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and Senator Boyle, who can never see a microphone without speaking into it, are nauseating.  Deputy Gogarty has subjected us to streams of consciousness on issues of Dáil reform and junior Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">We have the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, who has responsibility for food and horticulture.  I cannot figure out what it is he does that is in any way different to the responsibilities exercised by the senior Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, appears to be essentially the Minister for wild mushrooms.  It seems that his primary function is to pop up every so often in the media, surrounded by vegetables.  I do not refer to the type of vegetables we saw at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis surrounding Mr. David Davin Power but to vegetables of the edible variety.  The Minister of State runs a website on which one can get happy hints on how to do one's gardening.  I do not believe it requires €150,000 a year, paid by taxpayers, in addition to a number of departmental advisers, for any Member of the House to achieve this.  I am reluctant, on occasion, to slap myself on the back but I am a fair and reasonable gardener myself and I do not believe I should get an extra €50, 000 a year from the taxpayers of Ireland to be able to speak eloquently about my geraniums or the benefits of planting my own lettuces.  Yet, it seems to me that is essentially this Minister of State's function.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">There are people in this House who have mysterious roles.  The Minister of State,  Deputy Noel Ahern, has special responsibility for road safety.  For the life of me, I have not been able to figure out what he does that is different from what Gay Byrne does.  The Road Safety Authority of Ireland, as I understand it, is a separate body and the Minister of State cannot even answer questions in this House in its respect.  If that junior ministry were to be abolished overnight we would not see people gathered in protest in their thousands outside Leinster House in order to save the Minister of State's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We then have Deputy Seán Power, who is Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  His special responsibility, God help us, is the information society, as Deputy Hogan already mentioned.  If this means doing something to ensure that everybody in the country can have access to broadband, it is quite clear that the Minister of State has failed utterly in his function.  I constantly hear the senior Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, talking about broadband.  Is it necessary for him to have a mini-me junior Minister who can mouth the same inanities when the Government has failed utterly to deliver on policy in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Then there is the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, whose responsibility is health promotion and food safety.  I am not quite sure whether because the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has responsibility for food and horticulture, and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has responsibility for food safety, we are to understand there is a difference in what Deputy Sargent does with regard to food and what Deputy Wallace does.  Is it that Deputy Sargent is responsible for food that is slightly dangerous and just a little iffy, whereas Deputy Wallace is responsible for food that is supposed to be safe?  In the context of health protection and the cervical cancer immunisation programme, I am not aware that Deputy Mary Wallace was consulted on the cancellation of that programme, or of what input she has made to it.  I do not see what added value she lends to that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">We have Deputy Michael Kitt, who is Minister of State with special responsibility for local services.  He is attached to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government along with Deputy Michael Finneran, who has responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas.  Does either of them know the difference in their individual functions?  Does anyone outside this House know?  Can anyone actually define what it is either gentleman does that is different from what the other does?  What requires us to have two Ministers of State with practically identical functions but different names?  A former Taoiseach was inventive and the current Taoiseach has maintained that area of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We then have the ultimate Minister of State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, whose grasp of her brief was rather eloquently displayed to the nation in a recent edition of "Prime Time".  She has responsibilities for older people.  God help us, she is the Minister of State who did not know that the medical card was being taken as a right from the over 70s.  What does she do for older people other than issuing a newsletter exhorting them to live a long life?  What is she doing?  In what way do any of these Ministers of State function in a manner that matters to the public or increases the greater good of society?</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The truth is that everybody in this House, including all those on the Government benches, knows that these ministerial appointments are nothing other than political sinecures designed to keep a reasonable number of members of the Government parties happy that they have a title and a so-called status.  At this stage, when this country faces enormous economic difficulties, nobody can say that abolishing junior ministerial positions will solve our economic problems.  However, at least it would be symbolic and would show that we are getting our act together structurally in this House and that the Government acknowledges the need to tackle areas of waste in the use of taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It is hugely depressing that the response to this motion from the Government side is not to accept the motion but to declare that the volume of Government business has grown.  This statement is worth quoting in its superficiality:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_532">The Cabinet has established a Committee to draw up a comprehensive programme of reforms to ensure that the Dáil carries out the business of Parliament within an efficient and modern framework, and recognises the need to ensure the best return to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">There would be a better return to the Exchequer if we got rid of the number of junior Ministers and their accompanying advisers.  That would be an instant saving of approximately €8 million per year that might be better spent on other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The truth, of course, is that our parliamentary system and our democratic system are essentially broken.  The truth is that none of the parties in government, neither the Green Party, nor the remnants of the Progressive Democrats nor the Fianna Fáil Party, have any real interest in Dáil reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">The experience in this House over the past 12 years is that Fianna Fáil in government, regardless of the party that accompanies it, has sought to ensure that this Parliament plays as minimal a role as possible.  There is no acceptance of parliamentary accountability or of responsibility for anything that goes wrong.  There is no question of an incompetent Minister ever resigning, for any reason.  Question Time in the Dáil has been played around with to the extent that it is little short of show business rather than a true parliamentary engagement.  Every Minister who comes into this House knows that, because of the way Question Time is organised, if he or she talks long enough on any issue he or she will never be held to account for anything because the timeframes for individual and supplementary questions are limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">This Parliament is not functioning in any shape or form as a modern Parliament should function.  This is a consequence of the manner in which this Parliament has been treated by a succession of Fianna Fáil-dominated Governments whose sole objective is to ensure that Ministers are never held properly to account for their failings.  We have an economic disaster that is a substantial result of failed Government policies, not only those prior to the May 2007 election but those implemented by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in government during the first 18 months of their period in power.  There has been a complete failure to come to grips with the economic crisis this country confronts.  Nobody in government is willing to say: "We got it wrong.  We apologise.  We are accountable.  We recognise the time has come for us to go and for the people to give a new mandate to another political party or to the specific policies required to get this country on the road to recovery".</p>
          <p eId="para_538">This motion is a litmus test of the sincerity, first, of the Green Party in government whose members propound their commitment to Dáil or parliamentary reform.</p>

Will they have the courage to vote according to their so-called beliefs tomorrow night or are they playing the cynical political game that was played in this House for so many years by the Progressive Democrats?  They have one foot in government and the other out of government.  They say the populist thing while always doing what they believe is in the interests of their own party and the Government of which they are a member.  The Green Party members will show tomorrow night that they have no courage.  Tomorrow night the Greens will happily go along and vote to maintain the 20 Ministers of State we have currently.  Let no Government Minister or Minister of State come into this House and lecture the public about the need for cost savings or lecture Members about the need for this House to deal with its business in a more cost-efficient way in circumstances where they vote to maintain 20 Ministers of State, at least eight of whose functions are completely and totally irrelevant——</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_543">Given the number of Ministers of State and Ministers, Ireland has one of the largest Governments in the EU while being one of the smallest states.  When one takes those numbers and calculates the percentage of members of the Government compared to the number of Members of the Legislature, it is more than 20%.  This is one of the largest percentages in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Deputies Hogan and Shatter have spoken about some of the roles performed by some of the Ministers of State.  When I came into this House just under two years ago and participated in the committees, I was really surprised to learn that a chairman of a committee has an allowance of €20,000.  This is an incredible amount of money for some chairmen who only chair two or three meetings.  A vice-chairman gets €10,000 while convenors — I did not even know there were convenors — get €6,000 each.  The public perception of politicians is that we are creaming it and in my view that is an unfair perception.  However, as long as the Government chooses to do nothing about changing that perception, it will persist and it is a slur on the entire body politic.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I have spoken many times about reform of the public sector.  I have always said that reform should be done with a scalpel and not with a lump hammer.  What I mean by a lump hammer is the public sector pension levy because that is lump hammer economics.  It is a case of, "Here you go, lads, a 7% decrease in your salary".  I do not know what will happen on 7 April but perhaps the Ministers of State opposite know.  However, it will be lump hammer economics again.  It is a case of an increase in the standard and higher rates of income tax but without reform.  The reason there is no reform is because there has been an <i>entente </i>between the Government, the management of all the public sector areas — the management are extremely well paid — and the public sector unions.  The <i>entente </i>is obvious in the case of this proposal, unless the Government chooses to do something about it.  There is no public sector union for Ministers of State so they are on their own.  They will have to fight their own corner to stay in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The Taoiseach is the manager in this case; it is within his remit to decide that under the current circumstances, and because of the financial difficulties we face, the number of Ministers of State should be reduced.  The only thing the public is looking for, and has been looking for since the budget last October, is fairness.  Prior to the last budget, the Government's spin doctors put out the line that the people who earn more would be expected to pay more.  However, this did not happen as we saw with the attack on the medical card for old age pensioners and the other very unfair aspects of that budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">We do not need 20 Ministers of State; 12 would be enough.  I think it was the former Taoiseach, the late Charlie Haughey, who started the practice during the leadership contest with George Colley.  I was only a child at the time but, if I remember correctly, Mr. Haughey promised people he would make them Ministers of State if they supported him, and that happened.  He created positions so that he could become Taoiseach.  It is a power game and the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, knows that better than most.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">Then I can keep going. The measure of any society is how well we look after those who are less capable of looking after themselves, but our society is not doing this.  We are not prepared to take on public sector reform courageously by removing excesses and non-productive areas.  In my view, an example should be set by the leadership of the State which means the Government and the Taoiseach.  The excessive numbers within the junior ministerial ranks is extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I refer to a point made by Deputy Shatter about the Green Party.  I do not necessarily agree with everything he said but, in my view, the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, is one of the few people who acted with the courage of his convictions.  He said he would not go into Government with Fianna Fáil——</p>

          <p eId="para_555">I apologise.  He said he would not lead the Green Party and he stood by that decision.  However, I cannot say the same for his senior colleagues.  They have gone into Government and they have become the new green, the republican green, and, in effect, they have been consumed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is disappointing, considering the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent's stance.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Given that there are so many Ministers, the role of a Minister has been devalued.  Ministers show up for everything.  No matter what is happening anywhere in the country, there is a Minister capable of opening just about anything.  If an envelope dropped on the floor, a Minister of State would have it opened before it even hit the ground.  I remember there used to be a big to-do if a Minister visited a constituency but there is no to-do now because there are so many Ministers falling over each other to put a hand on a scissors to open bits and pieces.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">It should be a privilege to be the chairman of an Oireachtas committee and there should not be a €20,000 payment.  Being a Chairman is a halfway house between being a backbencher and a Minister of State.  A Deputy is paid €100,000 while a chairman is paid an allowance of an extra €20,000 and a Minister of State is paid €150,000.  Those of us on the backbenches who try to get our message across are not given the same coverage as a Minister of State or a senior Minister and neither are we given the same coverage as the chairman of a committee.  Being appointed a chairman should be regarded as a privilege and Members should be glad to have the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I refer to the anger in the country.  I am out and about knocking on doors on behalf of European and local election candidates.  At every door, people are angry not because hard decisions have been made, but because unfair decisions have been made.  The Government does not seem to get that or understand it.  Members on the other side of the House say that people are angry because of the hard decisions but they are mistaken; they are angry because the Government has not been fair or reasonable.  The reason the Government has neither been fair nor reasonable is because it is completely out of touch.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_562">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_570">urges the expenditure review group to expedite its review of where reductions can be achieved within the Oireachtas."</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the Dail this evening in relation to this counter motion.  I believe that the Government has a good story to tell with regard to Government and Oireachtas reform and the drive for greater efficiency in these areas.  This reform is not only timely, but also necessary.  Various initiatives have been taken and are in the pipeline.  Taken together, they will ensure that the systems of public representation and of governance in our country will be more efficient and address the evolving needs of our rapidly changing society.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">It remains true,  and  indeed  inevitable,  that the business of Government continues to grow year on year both in volume and complexity.  While this is probably the case almost everywhere throughout the world, there are obvious reasons for the expansion of the workload in this country.  After many decades of population decline, our population has increased significantly over recent years.  The cultural diversity of our people has also increased remarkably over the past decade or so.  Our society is now truly cosmopolitan.  One has only to keep an ear open on the streets of any of our cities and towns to hear a diverse range of languages being spoken.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">While we welcome this cultural and societal diversity, we must acknowledge that it poses particular challenges.  These challenges, arising from changes to our population, have long been familiar in many other countries, but are still relatively new in the Irish context.  While we can learn from the experience of others, we must forge our own solutions and responses to the issues that social change brings about.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">It is widely recognised that the process of government in the modern era is complex and multifaceted.  We have a sophisticated and educated population which, rightly, has high expectations of Government.  It demands — and is entitled to — top quality public services that are delivered efficiently and that provide value for the tax euro paid.  There is a greater awareness than ever before that few problems confronting Government have a single, or narrow focus. Most of what are termed the "big issues" on the Government agenda cut across the traditional boundaries of ministerial and departmental responsibility.  I believe all sides of the House can agree that holistic integrated thinking and actions is required to address these issues.  This Government is determined to ensure that the appropriate structures that it has in place are adequate and appropriate to address these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The severe economic and fiscal challenges facing this country add a further layer of intricacy to the issues that I have just mentioned.  An economic recession does not mean that the demands on Government have abated.  It means we must manage the needs of our country with significantly diminished resources, while addressing the particular challenges and problems that are characteristics of recession in a small open economy such as ours.  As we all know, tax revenues have fallen sharply over the past number of months and Government must take hard decisions about spending allocations and prioritise if we are to maintain essential services and to put our public finances and the economy back on the right track.  As politicians, these are difficult decisions to take, but are essential to the future of the country. Indeed, the nature of the problems facing the country at present means that the oversight by Government of, and our taking action in relation to, the economy and the public finances must be an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">It is essential that Ministers devote their resources to discharging their responsibilities in these challenging times.  Anyone who has been privileged to hold ministerial office will know that it is simply not possible for Ministers to carry out effectively the range of complex tasks for which they are responsible without the support of Ministers of State.  It is because of the increasing complexity of Government business and the enhanced focus on the need for joined up thinking that the number of Ministers of State has been increased on several occasions since the office was first introduced in 1977.  Indeed, it was the rainbow Government which increased the number during its time in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I have no doubt that the decision taken by the Government led by former Taoiseach John Bruton and his Cabinet colleagues at the time, Deputy Enda Kenny and Deputy Richard Bruton, recognised the cross-cutting nature of so many of the problems that confront Government.  In recognition of this, I would like to say a little more about this factor and the unique role that Ministers of State can and do play in leading and co-ordinating these multifaceted issues and in ensuring that policy responses are appropriate and comprehensive.  Deputy Hogan focused on a number of specific areas, but it is important to flesh out areas that, I believe, people may need to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Specific areas of Government activity where Ministers of State play a pivotal role in ensuring joined-up thinking and action include integration policy, where the particular challenges posed by the integration of the new Irish into our community are addressed and suitable policy initiatives brought forward.  Ironically, former Deputy Gay Mitchell, now an MEP, was one of the people, along with other parties who called for such a position to be established, because of the high number of multicultural groups in his constituency at the time.  Much has been said about lifelong learning.  As anyone who has been involved in education for some time will know, this is a new relatively untapped area which requires substantial input, both here and elsewhere.  The Government is acutely aware that the needs of the jobs market place and those of modern society demand that all of us remain open to new ideas and to the acquisition of new skills and expertise.  I know those Deputies opposite whom I have met in a previous job I held fully recognise  the opportunities presented to young and not so young in the area of lifelong learning through vocational educational committees, local partnerships, RAPID groups and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">In the area of science, technology and innovation it is clear we must strive to place Ireland at the cutting edge.  This is a challenge for various sectors of our society if we are to set the pace once the world economy shows the first signs of growth and renewal.  That is why we  have a framework document on developing the smart green economy.  As regards children, disability and older people, our society must be one that truly cherishes all of its citizens, and attends to the needs of those who may sometimes be marginalised and unable to realise their full potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Let us look again, for a moment, at integration policy.  The management of the asylum-seeking process has sometimes tended to overshadow, especially in the media, the challenge of facilitating the effective integration of the much larger number of immigrants — including successful asylum applicants — who are settling in Ireland for the medium to long term.  Ireland is late on the scene as a major recipient of economic immigration — most of our previous experience has been in the opposite direction.  From the immigration experience in other countries, it is commonly held that the most important factor in avoiding socio-demographic problems down the line is the effective integration of the immigrant groups with the indigenous population and with each other.  Where this aspect has been mishandled or neglected, the long-term social and economic consequences have proved deleterious, even disastrous in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Government has sought to avoid this potential downside by addressing the integration issue in a measured, focused and strategic fashion.  To this end, the Government has created an office of Integration under the leadership of a Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, with staff drawn from a number of Departments and State bodies which provide services in this area.  Integration issues in so far as they affect all non-Irish nationals coming to the State come under the remit of this new office.  A major priority for the office is the development of a coherent national policy on integration which draws on global best practice, establishing what works best, and which is tailored to the needs of Irish society as well as the reasonable requirements of immigrants who are lawfully resident in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Another area of public policy, arising from demographic changes, which the Government believes merits increased and intensified focus, is the particular range of problems arising from the steadily increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and over in the population.  In 2006 the percentage of the population aged 65 and over was 11%.  By 2011 this is estimated to rise to 14.1% and to 20% by 2036.  This expansion has to be planned for, and problems of particular relevance to this older generation addressed.  A central element is the preparation of a new national positive ageing strategy — an interdepartmental strategy which is being developed under the supervision of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Máire Hoctor.  These are some of the problems that fall to be addressed as the population of older persons continues to increase both in absolute and in percentage terms, and which reinforce the need for extra assistance at Minister of State level.  Public policy has become more complex as our society has grown and developed.  We are all aware of the need to tackle various policy issues in an interdepartmental and more focused manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The motion before the House represents a certain cynicism on behalf of the Opposition.  In the run-up to the election in 2007, the so-called "Mullingar accord" promised new Departments including one for small business, as suggested by Deputy Hogan.  There was to be a Minister with responsibility for integration, one for a healthy population, a full Department of the marine and a new Minister of State with responsibility for labour and social affairs.  I would be the first to admit that each of these is worthy of a special policy focus.  However,  for the Opposition to now put down tonight's motion only strengthens the cynicism that many people have towards politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">The Deputy will have an opportunity if, or when, he reaches this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I assure the House and the public that the Government is committed to ensuring Ministers of State represent optimum value for money and that they contribute to the savings that are so necessary to put our economy and our public finances back on an even keel.  Along with Ministers, Ministers of State accepted a voluntary pay reduction of 10% late last year.  In addition, the recently enacted public service pension levy deduction applies to salaries of Ministers and Ministers of State as it does to the salaries of all public servants.  The cadre of Ministers of State will continue to play an invaluable role in the delivery of our extensive programme for Government and represents even better value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Much has been said about Oireachtas and Government reform.  I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to promoting efficiency and reducing costs in all aspects of the administration of the Oireachtas and the running of Government.  As parliamentarians, we must also show that we are committed to ensuring that the Oireachtas remains relevant in the way it does its business to our people now and in the future.  We must also show we are motivated by the determination to drive down costs and deliver an ever more efficient service.  To these ends, in addition to the measures already mentioned, the Government has piloted a wide range of important initiatives, which I will mention briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I refer to Seanad reform.  The sub-committee of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges published a report in April 2004.  That report raised a range of difficult and complex issues.  It set out recommendations for comprehensive reform of the Seanad for further consideration.  These recommendations are being considered by the all-party group chaired by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to establish the extent of all-party consensus on the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I understand that all political parties are currently considering a paper prepared by the group setting out various issues associated with Seanad reform in advance of the group's final meeting scheduled for 22 April 2009.  Clearly, the whole question of Seanad reform is a core element in a wider debate about democracy and the political process.  We saw something of that on "The Late Late  Show" last Friday night.  The work of the group is potentially of major significance and I am sure I speak for all in the House when I wish the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and his group well as they strive to find an all-party consensus approach to this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I refer to Dáil reform, an area in which I have a particular interest.  I am delighted to see Deputy Stanton in the House and I commend him on all the work he has done in this area.  We sometimes hear criticisms that parliament in general, including this House, has become somewhat irrelevant to the needs and interests of contemporary society.  I believe profoundly that such criticisms are usually founded on an incomplete understanding of the work parliamentarians do.  However, it would be foolish and blinkered to adopt a complacent attitude and assume we can continue to discharge our business without alteration, following unchanged patterns laid down in the past.  Like all institutions, this House must adapt and change to reflect developments in society at large.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">With this in mind, the Government has established a group to identify how best we can restructure the way we do our business in the Dáil and to ensure that the people have a modern Parliament which reflects their concerns and needs.  As all of us know, the Dáil has two primary roles which are to be examined by the group and, where possible, improved.  These are to bring forward legislation and to hold the Government to account.  The working group is charged with identifying a range of reforms which will improve the workings of the Dáil as a Parliament for the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">There are many good ideas out there which have come from the Opposition as well as from the Government side.  The Government side does not claim to have a monopoly on knowledge or insight on how to restructure the business of the Dáil.  The Government initiative in this area has the potential to make this House truly relevant to the needs of our evolving society.  I am confident that within a relatively short period of time, we will be in a position to bring forward very significant proposals which I hope will receive broad approval from the House.  Deputy Stanton is smiling.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">The proposal will be brought through the sub-committee and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Another important matter is Oireachtas expenditure.  We know that virtually no sector of our society is immune from the negative impact of the economic downturn.  It is important that we in the Oireachtas show leadership by putting our own ship in order.  I understand that the Oireachtas Commission has recently brought forward a range of proposals which will yield €4 million in savings on a full year basis.  This will incorporate a 10% overall reduction in Members' expenses.  The proposals represent a response from Deputies and Senators across all parties to the need for Oireachtas Members to play a leading role in finding savings in State spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">In this regard, the Oireachtas Commission has recommended the adjustments to the Minister for Finance, which include a reduction in the daily allowance paid to Dublin Members and a reduction in the number of Oireachtas committees.  I note there is no mention of Oireachtas committees in the Fine Gael motion even though there has been much talk about them.  I wonder if there has been a change of mind on that matter in Fine Gael, but I merely speculate.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">——is examining in detail all aspects of public expenditure.  The group will review the scope for reducing or refocusing the existing range of expenditure programmes and it will look critically at the numbers of public servants employed across all areas of the public service to assess the scope for transferring staff to priority areas, for reducing numbers overall and to identify surplus staff.  The overall efficiency of the public service will be examined, including ways of doing business that are out of step with the needs of a modern, responsive public service.  The group will also examine and make recommendations for further rationalisation of State agencies beyond the measures announced in budget 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Among the areas coming under the review of the group is the Oireachtas.  The Government is anxious that the group expedites its review of where savings and efficiencies can be effected in the Oireachtas.  We want to see that happen at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I turn briefly to the question of the staffing of Ministers' offices who work on constituency matters.  Ministers have two roles, namely, they have responsibility as members of Government as well as their role as public representatives looking after the interests of their constituents.  It is very important that Ministers have appropriately staffed constituency offices to enable them to devote due attention to their Cabinet responsibilities in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Many Members will recall that in a recount in Cork, the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, had to make a presentation on the amount of time devoted to his constituency work as opposed to time spent on work outside his constituency.  It turned out that more than 50% of the work of the Minister related to issues outside his constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Appropriate staffing levels in this area mean that Ministers can strike a reasonable balance between the time they devote to their Government responsibilities and to dealing with the call of their constituents.  Ministers' offices have not been immune from the ongoing drive for greater efficiency across the public service.  The 3% reduction in pay allocations in the current year impacts on Ministers' offices as it does on the public service generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Furthermore, the Government has also decided that the running costs of Ministers' offices be reduced by at least 10% and this decision has been implemented.  In short, Ministers' offices along with all parts of the public service must work smarter with fewer resources.  While the Government is fully committed to the achievement of efficiencies and the process of reform, much has been done already in this area and more is in the pipeline.</p>

When Deputy Hogan was in government he had many opportunities to do something about it, but in this Government he will see, to start with, reform in the Seanad.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, will be able to speak more comprehensively on this aspect because we are now seeing reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">I listened carefully.  Technology allows me to do so without being present in the Chamber.  The Oireachtas Commission recently brought forward a number of proposals which we expect will deliver savings of some €4 million on a full year basis.  It is an initiative by Members of the Oireachtas from all parties and will contribute towards the crucial goal of reducing public expenditure.  The specific changes which the commission has recommended include reducing the number of Oireachtas committees which, strangely, given Deputy Hogan's declared interest in reform, does not feature, even in passing, in his motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I wonder, when we hear about the €20,000 paid to chairpersons who are members of Fine Gael as well as other parties, why the Deputy would not declare his sincerity and say his party will forgo this money to demonstrate just how serious he is about reform, if he is serious about it the first place.

          <p eId="para_632">The Ministers of State have accepted the pension levy and a 10% pay cut.  I have cut another 10% from the expenditure in my own office.

It is up to the Taoiseach to declare how it is done and who does it, but it needs to be done.  Food security in this country is something which will need to be faced up to.  The situation worldwide demands it.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">All of these issues, whether it is Agri Vision 2015, the McIvor report, the plans for the organic target which need to be driven or the obesity report, need to be addressed.

          <p eId="para_635">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  At the outset, I feel like the accused in the dock having to defend myself from the angry mob on the other side.  It is important to keep these things in perspective.  First and foremost, we are a parliamentary democracy.  We have two Houses of the Oireachtas, the Dáil and the Seanad.  Everybody on both sides of this debate acknowledges reform is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I want to address the issue of the motion itself and the reduction in the number of Ministers of State.  The role I play and feel I can play is something that is positive.  I feel I can genuinely make a contribution as a Minister of State.  When I was first appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs by the previous Taoiseach I was honoured to receive that appointment and felt I could make an impact, just as when I was first elected to the Dáil I felt I could make an impact as a Member of Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Everybody who stands and speaks here has a mandate as they were elected by the people.  Sometimes we diminish the role of politicians for populist debate.  I accept that is the cut and thrust of parliamentary democracy.  Fundamentally, politicians from all sides of this House are mandated to come here and speak on behalf of their constituents.  I believe sometimes we make apologies for that.  I will make no apologies that, as a Deputy, I have the resources to represent the people of Cork North-Central who, in their decisions over a number of elections, have decided to send me to Dáil Éireann as a messenger on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Reference has been made to the staffing levels of the offices of Ministers of State or Ministers.  I have two drivers.  I have two people working in the constituency office in Cork North-Central who serve the constituents.  I have one person in the office of the Minister of State who also works on constituency duties.  That is my staff complement in the context of my constituency duties.</p>

          <p eId="para_640">It would be unfair if I had fewer staff, simply because I have other roles and responsibilities.  As to whether people believe they are roles of responsibility is a decision those on other side of the House will make.  I passionately believe no person should be at a disadvantage in representing their constituents because of a role or responsibility they hold in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">This motion is slightly populist.  While there is intense public debate on this issue, it is not good enough, for populist reasons, to reduce the number of Ministers of State in order to send out a message that Government is serious about cost cutting without facing the serious challenges in other public expenditure costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I have no difficulty if the Taoiseach telehpones me tomorrow morning and says the game is up and I must step aside because of the necessity to cut costs.</p>

If we are to seriously degenerate the debate of the challenges facing Ireland, particularly the economic crisis, the global recession, an international credit crisis and all the other ills facing this country such as rising unemployment, we could say the solution would be to throw a few Ministers of State to the wolves and all the other issues would be resolved.  However, that simplifies a very important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We should have Dáil and Oireachtas reform.  There is a need to look at Seanad reform.  I have no difficulties in discussing those issues.

          <p eId="para_647">Since 1993 I have seen many a debate here on Dáil reform.  First and foremost, we do not want to diminish the roles of Oireachtas Members because we have a critical and important role to play, which is representing our constituents.  Ministers and Ministers of State should not be put at a disadvantage or at an unfair advantage to other Oireachtas Members from a particular constituency.  If one looks at the issue of an evolving Ireland, involved in Europe and facing into another Lisbon treaty referendum, we all know the crucial role Europe now plays.  In that regard, Ministers of State have an important function in making sure that Ireland is always represented by responsible Ministers.  The Fine Gael motion is somewhat populist.  There is a responsibility on us all to reflect on the challenges we face rather than putting forward these types of populists proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">I welcome the opportunity presented by this motion to examine the issue of reform of the institutions that enable our democracy to operate.  Many of these institutions, including the Oireachtas, were designed for a different era and time and to satisfy different requirements.  However, the motion before us proposes reform of only one aspect of this broad area and seems to be directed at cost savings rather than effective reform of the system.  If Deputy Hogan had not set out his case so clearly in proposing the motion, I would have suggested that it smacks of populism.  While the savings generated by the implementation of this proposal would represent the elimination of some unnecessary waste, they would be relatively small.  Moreover, it should be noted that reform does not always equate with savings, with some reforms costing more to implement than the system they are intended to replace.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the increase in the number of Ministers of State from 17 to 20 by this Administration has led to understandable public criticism.  Not only do many members of the public not know the identity and role of individual Ministers of State, Members themselves are often similarly confused.  Moreover, the creation of a large number of Oireachtas committees for the purpose of providing Government backbenchers with paid positions as chairmen, vice-chairmen and convenors has also been widely criticised.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made several such appointments to ensure that the Members in question towed the Government line.</p>

          <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I was.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, I successfully tackled the housing crisis.  I went on to serve as Minister of State with responsibility for the alternative energy sector in the Fine Gael-Labour Government, where I laid the foundation for an industry that is now booming.  Therefore, I am not of the view that Ministers of State are a waste of time or space.  They often do a good job within the democracy we all serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Having examined the matter, the Labour Party is of the view that the number of Ministers of State should be reduced to 15.  The rationale behind this proposal is that there should be one Minister of State serving the relevant senior Minister in each Department and being responsible to a standing legislative committee.  It is essential that effective powers are transferred to the Ministers of State so that they have a specific remit with clear responsibilities and targets.  Without a transfer of power order, which is made by the Government, Ministers of State are reduced to "gofers" for their senior Minister and have no effective role.  I am interested to know whether such orders were made for the current crop of less than outstanding officeholders, present company excluded.  They look tired and worn out and give Ministers of State a bad name.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">However, such changes would be little more than window dressing and a sop to public anger unless they are accompanied by reform of the Oireachtas committee system.  There are now serious duplications between several committees and these must be rationalised.  Nevertheless, committees play an important role in dealing with legislation on Committee Stage and in offering an opportunity to a wide cross-section of the citizenry to be consulted, to present their case and to be heard.  This is an important tool of democracy and it should be guarded zealously.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The aspect of reform by which I am most exercised is the matter of the transfer of the powers bestowed on this House by the people to faceless and unaccountable quangos, agencies or boards.  This ongoing practice has diluted our democracy by taking power from the people and their representatives and handing it over to so-called independent agencies.  I assume their independence consists solely in being independent of the people's representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">In its amendment to the motion, the Government puts great store by its establishment of a committee on Dáil reform.  This committee comprises the Fianna Fáil Whip and the Green Party Whip and effectively replaces the previous committee on Dáil reform which had no paid chairman or convenor and included all the party Whips.  We have heard much in recent times from the Government about co-operation from the Opposition.  The exclusion of the Opposition in this instance shows the shallowness of these calls for co-operation.  I have been involved with the Dáil reform committee for some years and every proposal, including many from Fianna Fáil representatives, was blocked by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I commend Fine Gael on putting forward this motion so that we can discuss a critical aspect of how the Government works.  Under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, there was an outrageous expansion of the Minister of State system.  This represented not only a waste of public money but has also played a part in discrediting our system of governance.  The public rightly questions exactly what it is that the 20 Ministers of State do.  There is general agreement that the last three or five appointments were made merely to keep Fianna Fáil backbenchers content.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">It is particularly disappointing that the Green Party joined and supported this grotesquely overblown, unwieldy and wasteful system of governance.  I am pleased to see the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, in the House for this debate.  His evolution into a Minister of State in a Government led by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is one of the most pathetic sights I have witnessed during my entire time in politics.  I recall all the mornings when the Minister of State stood on the other side of the House and berated the then Taoiseach and his Ministers on a range of matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">The key aspects of reshaping the structure of government, a process I hope will be undertaken by the next Administration, involve assessing the key functions in society and in the economy and seeking to manage them in a coherent way.  The Government has not done this.  There are various important roles to fulfil among the ranks of existing Ministers of State.  The Chief Whip, for example, performs a vital function.  It is important to have a Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people.  It is also vital to have a Minister of State to deal with issues relating to our membership of the European Union, particularly in the context of the debate on the provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  I was bitterly opposed to the way the marine function was cannibalised and shamefully wiped out by this Government under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the latter having promised marine interests that all relevant responsibilities would be held together under one Department.  I also see a function for a Minister of State with responsibility for community matters, with a particular emphasis on drugs issues.  There is also a function for a Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  There is room too for a Minister of State dealing with labour and employment issues.  These represent the key concerns of any Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Moreover, there are functions currently carried out by Ministers of State which should be represented in their own right by a full Department.  A good example of this is housing.  How on earth did we have a situation where the largest industry in the State — with 300,000 directly employed and up to 200,000 in related employment — was not represented at the Cabinet table?  My distinguished colleague, Deputy Stagg, had responsibility for this area as Minister of State under a previous Administration.  There have been other Ministers of State with responsibility for this issue, up to and including the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  However, along with the marine, housing should be represented by a full Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Other changes are required in the system.  The Department of Finance is a case in point.  We should look to the British system in this regard.  There is a strong case for the Minister for Finance having a financially inclined Member beside him or her in the role of deputy Minister for Finance.  With the best will in the world the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, came in here and gave us the first pre-budget submission when Fine Gael, Labour and everybody else was prepared to start the debate at full ministerial level.  There are many ways at both Minister and Minister of State level where the functions should be reformed.  I cannot see how the current system of 20 Ministers of State with the cobbled together bits of portfolios that many of them have can be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I will give one brief example.  I have been dealing with the Department for Transport, where there is a Minister of State.  In the past eight or ten months I am not sure what exactly he has been doing.  He needs to prepare one piece of legislation, a road traffic Bill.  For the past two years going back to before the time that I became spokesperson for the area and back into the previous Dáil we have been asking for that Bill.  I bet the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, even asked for that Bill, which we still do not have.  We have a Minister of State with responsibility for older persons.  A few weeks ago I asked her about nursing home care — a central issue relating to older persons.  I was told to contact another Department.  It seems to be an incoherent system that needs reform and I commend Fine Gael on tabling tonight's motion.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_675">No one can argue with the logic of the motion, especially given the current economic situation and that the Government appears to be intent on imposing a large part of the burden for saving public money on those who can least afford it.  All of us have received hundreds of representations through meeting constituents, and receiving e-mails, phone calls and letters about the effect the pension levy will have on low-paid workers in the public service and the impact of the vast range of cutbacks that have already been made.  Apparently many more are in the pipeline in the proposed budget next week — a week in which the people of Dublin will be without buses due to the shortsighted decision to decimate services and crews in the city, and a week in which tens of thousands of workers will be making known exactly what they think of the Government's approach to the economic and financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">It is ironic that the Government appears fully intent on draconian measures aimed at the public sector and public services while at the same time Ministers are falling over one another to associate themselves either geographically or otherwise with President Barack Obama.  I say that because President Obama's Administration is pumping $800 billion into a stimulus programme which it hopes will get the American economy going again.  It is interesting that the world's largest capitalist economy is placing so much emphasis on public investment while there seems to be an almost blind ideological aversion to that here.  There is a belief that, for example, laying off 200 bus workers to cut losses is worth the amount of money it will cost to keep them on social welfare, not to mention all the other negative consequences which any increase in unemployment has in social, health and other ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It is interesting that the US stimulus package has targeted areas for investment including physical infrastructure, schools, the upgrading of homes to become more energy efficient, health care and so on.  The hope obviously is that this will create jobs and generate further investment leading to recovery.  Our Government appears to want to go in the opposite direction and to attack all of those things.  After decades of neoliberal economics and a free hand given to the financial speculators who have brought the global economy to its knees, President Obama and the Democrats appear to be returning to their roots in the Roosevelt New Deal.  Keynes, who was for many years discredited, has been rediscovered and it is his theory of the multiplier — of investment leading to even greater spending — that underlies the current American package.  President Obama has turned his back on the reactionaries who would have American working class and middle class families pay the price for a crisis that is not of their making.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Fianna Fáil too should learn from its own history in this regard.  It was first elected in 1932 in large part due to the failures of the first Cumann na nGaedhael Government.  That Government ironically pursued many of the policies which seem to be tempting the current Government and which many suspect would also motivate the Fine Gael Party if it were in power.  It was a Government that cut pensions, refused to build public housing while Dublin's north inner city slums had the highest child death rate in Europe, and which considered abolishing both social welfare and income tax.  It was thrown out of office by Fianna Fáil with the support of Labour and Irish republicans including militant republicans.  Those early Fianna Fáil Governments were among the most radical in Europe because they understood the need to look after people's basic needs and because they were prepared to invest public money when those with wealth in this country refused to and put their money in the London banks and stock exchange.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The six aims of Fianna Fáil set out in 1928 were as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_680">To secure the unity and Independence of Ireland as a Republic.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">To restore the Irish Language as the spoken language of the people, and to develop a distinctive national life in accordance with Irish traditions and ideals.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">To make the resources and wealth of Ireland subservient to the needs and welfare of all the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_683">To make Ireland, as far as possible, economically self-contained and self-sufficing.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_684">To establish as many families as practicable on the land.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_685">By suitable distribution of power to promote the realisation of industries essential to the lives of the people as opposed to their concentration in cities.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">Where did it all go wrong?  Does this Fianna Fáil Government and its Green Party partners want to be remembered in the same way as Cumann na nGaedhael or will it return to its roots and even adopt the sort of approach being followed by President Obama in trying to stimulate the economy not by destroying ordinary people's living standards, but by injecting investment into the areas where it will pay dividends in jobs, spending and confidence?</p>
          <p eId="para_688">With regard to the substance of the motion, of course it makes sense to reduce the numbers of Ministers of State and to tackle the issue that some of those who are nominally working for Departments are in fact performing constituency work for the Ministers in question.  In a series of parliamentary questions to each Department regarding that issue, asking all Ministers for the number of civil servants engaged in constituency work on behalf of his or her Department, and the salaries, accommodation costs and expenses involved in or associated with these duties, it was disclosed that only the Ministers for State, Deputies Curran and Mansergh, did not have civil servants engaged in constituency work.  In total there were 44 civil servants whose time was spent looking after the Ministers' constituency work rather than anything to do with the work of whatever Department employed them.  As Sinn Féin's economic spokesperson, Deputy Morgan, said at the time in response to the information divulged, this use of significant numbers of civil servants for constituency work is an "outrageous squandering of the State resources".  It is an abuse of privilege.  At a time when the Government parties and Ministers are lecturing the rest of us on the need to accept cuts, and at a time when they are targeting low paid public sector workers in particular, it is ironic that they should also be cynically spending a significant amount of public money in attempting to protect their own Dáil seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, said that having civil servants in his constituency office was servicing his constituents.  There are four Sinn Féin Deputies.  We each have a person in our constituency offices.  The one in my area is paid for out of my own pocket.  At this stage between Ministers, Ministers of State, Chairmen, Vice Chairmen and conveners of committees, all bar two Members from the Government benches are covered.  That is not necessary and is an abuse.  It is also an abuse to have former Ministers and Ministers of State drawing ministerial pensions on top of their salaries.  It is wrong and there is an obligation on all of us to speak out against such abuse.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_696">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak about the recent vicious attacks on both tourists and residents in Tipperary town and to condemn the disgraceful behaviour of a small group of thugs who brought shame on themselves on St. Patrick's Day, our national holiday.  It was with great horror and disgust that I learned of the vicious attacks that ruined the national day festivities for so many in Tipperary.  As an elected Deputy for Tipperary South which includes Tipperary town, I apologise to our American visitors and the local families who were terrorised.  The attacks which left an American tourist in a serious condition in hospital as well as other residents injured after they had chosen to celebrate St. Patrick's Day on the streets of the town were despicable.  It is a source of great regret that the town has received so much bad publicity since St. Patrick's Day.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">It must be stated Tipperary is a beautiful town with a great sense of community spirit which was evident when so many went out to support the St. Patrick's Day parade in the town and so many community organisations and businesses entered floats.  The sunshine on the day was gallant and it should have been a tremendous day for all.  However, the actions of a few individuals damaged the efforts of those who had taken the time to organise the parade and festivities for everybody else.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">I compliment the mayor of Tipperary, Tipperary Town Council and the St. Patrick's Day committee on their hard work in organising such a splendid parade.  I was pleased to learn this morning that there was a huge Garda presence in the town area, including the emergency response unit, to address the matter.  We must now examine and address the root of the problem.  I compliment Superintendent Courtney and his team on their ongoing work in combating crime in Tipperary town but, unfortunately, gardaí cannot work alone and there cannot be a garda on every street corner.  Some 99.9% of the citizens of the town are decent and law-abiding, as are the citizens of most towns in the country, although a small few are hell-bent on making life miserable for the rest of the community.  I invite the national media to come to examine Tipperary town and try to portray some of the positive attributes of life there.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">Far too often, we witness attacks on innocent people simply because they get in the way of some thugs on a bad day.  There is nothing in place to allow ordinary individuals to defend themselves.  Those responsible for these vicious attacks are more often than not repeat offenders who will not stop until they are behind bars or, worse, they cause somebody's death.  They have no respect for others and absolutely no respect for law or order.  We must deal with them when apprehended.  While they are entitled to due process, to go before the courts and defend their good names, if they are found guilty and are repeat offenders, we should hit them where it hurts.  The State should stop funding those found guilty of such heinous offences.  They should be doing community service, trying to assist the communities in which they are wreaking havoc.  I call on the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance and Social and Family Affairs to work together to introduce legislation to deal with those who for far too long have been terrorising ordinary law-abiding citizens.  I have witnessed at first-hand what such attacks can do to a community.  I have experienced the fear that can be caused if a person is confronted by thugs.  I know people cannot defend themselves without putting themselves at risk of being persecuted.  This is not just a problem in Tipperary town, it has also become a problem in every community throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">I have great experience with Community Alert, the national organisation which helps the Garda Síochána.  Tipperary was the founding location in 1937 of Muintir na Tíre, the national community development organisation which has been based in Canon Hayes House in Tipperary town since.  Today, it operates its community development programme, supporting communities and encouraging people to be proactive within their own communities.  It has operated the community alert programme since 1985 in partnership with the Garda Síochána.  Through its network of community councils, it operates many innovative programmes in local communities.  I call on the public to come out and support the community alert groups, get involved in neighbourhood watch, be supportive of the Garda Síochána and together we can tackle these thugs and get them off our streets.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_701">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that due to other business he is unable to be present for the debate but I assure the Deputy that he shares his concern, as I do, about the incidents in Tipperary town on St. Patrick's Day and is conscious of how distressing such incidents are for the victims and the local community.  The Minister and I would like to sympathise with the victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">There is no excuse for the type of behaviour which took place in Tipperary town on St Patrick's Day which should be a day of celebration.  As the Deputy knows, I have often enjoyed the hospitality and friendship of the people of Tipperary town and the Glen of Aherlow.  The Minister and I find it particularly deplorable that injuries resulted from these incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">I am informed that the Garda made a number of arrests shortly after the incidents took place.  The persons arrested were subsequently charged with offences under public order legislation, pending ongoing investigations into more serious incidents, including a number of assaults, and were remanded in custody.  Arising from the scale of the assaults, a Garda investigation team was assembled and an incident room established at Tipperary Garda station under the supervision and direction of the district officer.  As part of the investigation, CCTV footage has been sought from a number of local premises.  I understand the CCTV footage being examined is of high quality and expected to greatly assist the investigative process.  A Garda sergeant has been appointed by local Garda management to liaise with victims.  I am also informed that to assist the investigation an operation was put in place today for a large number of searches to be carried out by district and divisional personnel, supported by the regional support unit, the Garda air support unit and the Garda dog unit.  A number of premises were searched and a number of persons arrested.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">The incidents which took place on St. Patrick's Day in Tipperary town and other incidents coming to the attention of local Garda management in the course of the investigation are being thoroughly investigated and investigating gardaí are confident that further substantial progress will be made.  The House will appreciate that I am not in a position to say more on the Garda investigation at this time.  It appears that the consumption of alcohol may have played a role in the disturbances.  We have to recognise that alcohol lies behind many incidents of public disorder and violence and that there is a problem with binge drinking.  Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda to tackle the misuse of alcohol which is often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour.  The Act places restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse.  As a result of the Act, it is now possible for a garda to issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">Operation Encounter has been in operation since 2002.  It specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by under-age persons.  Over 520,000 offences have been detected during the operation.  All members of the Garda Síochána proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot spots by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed at these areas during times when the offences are more likely to occur.  All such incidents detected by members on patrol or reported to the Garda are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">The personnel strength of the Tipperary Garda division at the end of January, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 387 — a significant increase of 26% over four years — while the strength of the Tipperary town Garda district was 39 — an increase of 18%.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the force, taking all relevant factors into account.  Garda management will fully consider the needs of the Tipperary Garda division within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.  The incidents which took place on St. Patrick's Day are completely unacceptable and it is right that this House says so.  I welcome the substantial progress which the Garda investigation has already made and I am glad that the Garda are confident of making further progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  As I understand it, letters rejecting REPS 4 applications were issued today to a number of farmers across the country, an issue about which there is currently much consternation.  I have a particular interest in the REPS scheme given my involvement in 1995 in the roll-out of the REPS 1 scheme.  I recall that over a period of two and a half years approximately 46,000 farmers registered as REPS farmers.  I have always considered it to be an innovative and creative scheme that does a great deal to protect our environment.  Farmers are the greatest custodians of our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">REPS 4 was launched in August 2007 but did not really get up and running until January 2008 owing to operational problems with the eREPS system, a computer package for the compilation of plans introduced as a result of the nitrates directive.  An information day for planners in September 2007 merely scratched the surface with regard to the workings of the scheme.  While terms and conditions and planner specifications were available at the time, they raised more questions than anything else.  In hindsight, these should have been vigorously analysed, but owing to time constraints that was not possible.  Insufficient information on the scheme was provided by the Department to planners and farmers at that particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">New applicants to the scheme were required to have their plans drawn up and submitted prior to 15 May 2008.  Huge volumes of plans had to be submitted in a short space of time which, in turn, put huge pressure on planners and farmers to have work completed before this deadline.  Planners claim that in the period up to 15 May 2008 they received little guidance, assistance and clarification from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in regard to drawing up REPS 4 plans.  I do not know if this is true but the planners with whom I have been in contact on behalf of farmers all point to the vagueness and misinformation from day one in terms of how the scheme was presented.  Also, it appeared to them at that time that there was a great deal of confusion within the Department on how to answer REPS planner questions about the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Late in 2008, farmers received letters confirming that their REPS plans had been received by the Department and were being processed.  Once plans were being processed from May to December 2008, planners received letters from the Department seeking extra information, minor adjustments and clarification on some issues in the plans, which is normal procedure.  These changes were in most cases promptly made.  There was no mention at that time of major issues arising with measures 2 and 4 within the plans.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to measure 2 which relates to grassland management, which is quite simple to represent on a plan and measure 4 which relates to habitats.  Totally misguided information in respect of these two measures was issued to planners.  Farmers received letters stating:  "The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food hereby accepts your agri-environmental plan and admits your application subject to the Scheme terms and conditions, and to the provisions of Council Regulations 1698/05."   The letter also provided information on when plans commenced, the contract area, how many months and how much they would be paid for in 2008 and how much they would receive for a full calendar year within REPS 4.  There was then a time lag between these letters and the next step.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Rumours started to circulate in January 2009 that many of these plans would be rejected or at the very least that a penalty would be imposed on them.  Planners were kept in the dark with regard to these procedures and are now being unfairly scapegoated for the whole problem.  Many farmers have already missed out on two years of REPS and if plans are rejected they will miss out on another.  Farmers simply cannot survive without this direct payment which is the only element of guaranteed income from single farm payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Today, farmers across the country received letters in regard to rejection of their plans, an issue about which I am sure all Members will be hearing tomorrow.  This is unfair.  I am sure the Minister of State will in response to this matter read out the standard reply from the Department.  REPS 4 plans should not be rejected.  They should be returned to planners for amendment and updating.  Also, the Minister of State or his Department officials should explain these measures to planners and advise them in regard to what they must do.  This is the least that could be done at this stage for a community under a great deal of pressure to survive until next year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_713">Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Deenihan as ucht an ábhair tábhachtach seo a ardú.  Also, I acknowledge his hard work during his time as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">As stated by Deputy Deenihan, REPS has been one of the most successful schemes operated by my Department since its launch in 1994.  It has brought more than €2 billion in payments to Irish farmers.  Farmers in REPS received more than €313 million in payments last year.  The number of people involved in the scheme, including those applicants for REPS 4 currently being processed, stands at more than 60,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">As the Deputy stated, REPS has always been about much more than money.  It has delivered benefits to the environment, water quality, biodiversity and the landscape.  Since the nitrates derogation allowed us to open up the scheme to the highly stocked dairy sector, farmers who would not previously have considered REPS are now showing interest.  Indeed, many have actually made their applications.  REPS is a complex scheme.  Currently, a participant in REPS must include all of his or her land in the scheme and must commit to 11 basic measures and at least two biodiversity options.  If Natura land is involved, there may be other obligations.  This set of undertakings, negotiated with the European Commission, is the basis for payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">In recent years, the European Commission and the Court of Auditors have taken an increasingly critical approach in their scrutiny of farm payment schemes not alone in Ireland but in other member states.  Agri-environment measures such as REPS are being closely audited following a negative report by the Court of Auditors in 2006 which found that huge amounts of EU money was being spent on schemes the outcomes of which were difficult or even impossible to measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">We had two audit visits on REPS last year; one by the Court of Auditors and one by the European Commission.  Both raised serious questions about our procedures for examining applications for REPS.  It was evident that we had to make fundamental changes in the way we dealt with applications.  It became necessary, therefore, for my Department to scrutinise every REPS application and plan in the greatest detail.  We had to introduce an entirely new system last year for processing REPS 4 applications.  I am well aware that this has meant that farmers have had to wait much longer than expected for their first REPS 4 payments.  I know that up to half of those who applied in 2008 are still waiting for payments.  I do not suggest for one moment that this is a satisfactory situation; it is one we hope not to find ourselves in again.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">There are a number of reasons for the delay.  First, we had to develop a computer system for screening plans that had been prepared on eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by the Department.  There are no safe short cuts in developing computer systems and it took several months to get this one to an acceptable level.  Second, the non-eREPS plans had to be screened manually at a time when the staff who had to do this work were also heavily involved in the farm waste management scheme.  Also, all the plans had to be cross-checked against the LPIS system and further checked to confirm that they included the necessary biodiversity options.  These last two checks were also computerised.  At that point, which we reached at the end of January, we were finally able to start making payments on plans about which none of the checks had raised any queries.  Of the more than 12,000 plans, however, fewer than 1,400 plans came through the initial set of screening checks without being queried.  The rest of the files had to be checked manually.  Almost 5,000 of the files have since been processed.  The queries have been fully resolved in most cases, although small reductions have been applied to a number of payments because of a deficiency in the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are making every effort to get the remaining cases processed as quickly as possible.  In the case of a plan that is ineligible, it is important for the relevant farmer to ensure that a valid application is with the Department by 15 May next.  While the staff of the Department are doing everything they can to identify cases to which problems pertain, they cannot do everything.  Applications in respect of 2009 are already arriving in big numbers.  Last year, over 7,000 applications came in between 1 April and 15 May.  It is too much to expect the staff of the Department to be able to identify every application with a problem in time for a planner to fix it before 15 May.  I emphasise that no aspect of any plan can be put right after that date — that possibility simply does not exist under the regulations with which we have to live.  That is why every planner needs to be satisfied that every plan he or she prepares is fully in keeping with the terms and conditions of REPS and the cross-compliance obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I acknowledge that farmers have patiently waited for their REPS payments this year, at a time when cash flow is critical for many people.  I ask for their continued patience while the remaining applications are processed.  I ask them to keep their faith in REPS, which must continue to evolve if it is to meet changing priorities and reflect changing circumstances.  I am confident that the agricultural environment will be an important aspect of EU rural development policy for many years to come.</p>

          <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_355">
            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_721">I am pleased to have an opportunity to highlight this matter, which I have previously raised on the Adjournment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, who responded to me on that occasion, is familiar with the issues which are at stake.  Ballygarvan, which is approximately ten miles from Cork city, used to be a small rural village.  Like many other villages near large urban areas, it has been an attractive location for development.  The provision of facilities such as schools has not kept pace with the development of many such villages, unfortunately.  The development of a new primary school in Ballygarvan has been a long and protracted issue.  In 1998, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, promised that the area would get a new school.  The site that was identified was in the ownership of three separate parties, which unfortunately led to delays.  The entire site was finally acquired this week by the Diocese of Cork and Ross, on the basis of its understanding that the Department of Education and Science will proceed with the construction of a new school building there.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">Ballygarvan national school, which has 265 pupils, rents eight prefabs at an annual cost of approximately €84,000.  The Ballygarvan area is developing.  Many housing estates have been built in the area over the past ten years.  Approximately 140 houses have been built in Ballygarvan over that time.  Most of the people living in them now have young children and would like to send them to school in the village.  It is desirable for young people to be able to mix in their own localities.  I strongly support that because it is important for children and their neighbours to have a sense of ownership of their local communities, where possible.  I understand that planning permission has been granted for the construction of a further 140 houses in the area, which will put further pressure on the school under discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Earlier this week, Cork County Council signed over the third part of the proposed site for the new school to the Diocese of Cork and Ross, which now owns the entire site.  I would like the Minister for Education and Science to give a commitment to proceed with the construction of the new school building.  He has indicated previously that it is within his capacity to provide a school at the site in question.  Now that the ownership of the site has been reconciled, the next step should involve the appointment of a design team.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to appoint a team and to make progress with this development as soon as possible.  We do not want the appointment in question to become a long and protracted affair, involving endless consultation.  I do not think Ballygarvan national school should be left in such a quandary.  We need action now.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">I am aware of schools in other areas that cannot cope with the additional student numbers that have resulted from the excessive development in their localities.  Procedures should be put in place to fast-track school developments.  In this case, the design team should be appointed, the planning process should be completed, all the boxes should be ticked and on-site work should commence as quickly as possible so that the school, the local children and the local parents can be accommodated.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The Department of Education and Science is well aware of the long history of the proposed development at Ballygarvan national school.  As a site has now been acquired, further action should be taken immediately.  I ask the Minister of State to tell the House when a design team will be appointed, thereby ensuring that progress can be made with the construction of a new school building in Ballygarvan as quickly as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_726">I will respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank Deputy Clune for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects.  In particular, I will outline the current position in respect of Ballygarvan national school, Ballygarvan, County Cork.  The modernisation of the facilities in our existing building stock, like the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, presents a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">All applications for capital funding are assessed in the Department of Education and Science's modernisation and policy unit.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need in each case, based on the demographics of the area, any proposed housing developments, the condition of the buildings and the capacity of the proposed site, etc.  This process ultimately leads to the determination of an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of the process, projects are assigned band ratings under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  The criteria in question were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to each project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system in a manner that is commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">There are four band ratings, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, involve the provision of buildings where none currently exist but where there is a high demand for pupil places.  Band 4 projects, by contrast, involve the provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as libraries and sports halls.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">The proposed development at Ballygarvan national school has been assigned a band rating of 1.1, which is the highest rating possible and reflects the need for a new school in this instance.  The brief for this project involves the provision of a new 16-classroom school building.  The schedule of accommodation for the new school will include a 195 sq. m general purpose room, a library and resource area, a suite of special education tuition rooms and ancillary accommodation, including a staff room and a principal's office.  The Deputy will be aware that the project was included in the recent announcement of projects to commence architectural planning.  A suitable site comprising three plots of land was identified for the new school building in Ballygarvan.  It was originally intended that the Department would acquire the three plots of land.  Late last year, however, the Department agreed a proposal by the patron of the school that the Diocese of Cork and Ross would acquire the necessary plots of land.  I understand that the diocesan office has been actively engaged in finalising the acquisition.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that as the contracts will be agreed by the vendors and the diocese, the Minister has had no formal involvement in such discussions.  I understand, however, that the council members last night voted to approve the sale of council lands to the diocese and that the diocesan office is currently awaiting formal confirmation of this decision.  The Department will proceed with the appointment of a design team once the diocese is in a position to confirm acquisition of the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the school building project for Ballygarvan national school, County Cork.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_733">I welcome the opportunity to speak again on this issue this evening and I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this topic.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The decision to suspend classes for children with mild general learning disability is seriously regressive.  It is, again, hitting the most at risk children in the community and I am afraid that the mantra that the most vulnerable are to be protected is one that I am finding a bit difficult to take on board anymore.  The decision on children with mild general learning disability is damaging to the morale of teachers who have worked so hard to help these children to be able to cope with the mainstream class and it is causing enormous worry to the parents of the children concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">I pose a few questions to the Minister.  What is his plan for September next when a new intake of pupils will impact on the current status and the probability that the numbers of children who were in the mild general learning disability category will increase?  In almost all of the schools with which I am in contact in the areas that I have mentioned in Dublin 8 and Dublin 10, the teachers are aware of their communities, know the children, know what their intake will be like and are confident that the numbers will increase.  Will they regain a teacher, or a class, if the numbers increase or will they be left to struggle on and be even more disadvantaged than at present?</p>
            <p eId="para_736">What is the position regarding the general allocation ratio?  When will that be reviewed?  It seems that the Department is prompt in reviewing the ratio when the numbers drop and is not quite so efficient when it comes to an increase in numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Four schools, in particular, have asked that the possibility of clustering be considered to allow the retention of a combined special class for the pupils with mild general learning disability.  St. Louise De Marillac junior and senior schools in Ballyfermot would be happy to consider combining classes, thus meeting the required numbers to justify a special class as specified by the Minister.  Scoil Iosagáin and Scoil Mhuire-Sheosamh De La Salle in Ballyfermot make the same request.  They, too, would be happy to form a combined class if it is approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I am anxious to establish the position on clustering of classes in schools for purposes of mild general learning disability.  The Taoiseach indicated, at questions in the Dáil a few weeks ago, that this was a possibility.  On 10 March last, however, in reply to my parliamentary question, it was not clear what the intentions were in relation to this possibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The schools I mentioned need clarity.  Many other schools in Dublin 8 and Dublin 10 also need clarity on the prospects for September next and I can only emphasise again the negative consequences for the many children who will be seriously affected if the decision to cut these classes is upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The issue is not just about classes for those with mild general learning disability.  For many of the schools in the areas that I have identified the level of disadvantage is significant, the dropout rate is high, the reports have been published and the statistics speak for themselves.  While it is true that improvements have been observed, these recent decisions will simply turn back the clock and the cycle of disadvantage and drop-out will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">In reply to my parliamentary question on 10 March last, the Minister stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_742">I am open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The sentiment of that statement was encouraging because it reflects educational needs as a priority.  The facts, unfortunately, belie the sentiment as it would appear that number crunching and financial considerations are the driving force in the recent decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">The schools I mentioned are open to clustering of classes.  They are making a serious effort to put together a package that would be acceptable and helpful to them, and I would ask the Minister to take that on board.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_360" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_745">I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I thank Deputy Upton for raising this issue as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.  The first and most important point I wish to make is that all pupils with a mild general learning disability will continue to have additional teaching resources to support their education.  There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">All primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability.  Each school was given these additional teaching resources under the general allocation model of learning support-resource teaching introduced in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">I emphasise that these additional teaching resources have not been withdrawn from any school.  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils.  Most pupils with a mild general learning disability are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of pupils of different abilities.  This policy of inclusion has widespread support within the educational community.  Schools can use their resource-learning support allocation to give pupils special help if they need it.  This might be done with a teacher working with a group of pupils or on a one-to-one basis for a few hours each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Before the general allocation model was introduced, some schools grouped pupils with a mild general learning disability into special classes.  The Deputy will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability, the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department, however, allows for a small reduction in this number and permits a school to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  The rules also provide that a teacher would no longer be allocated where the number of pupils fell below nine.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">In a number of schools in Dublin 8 and Dublin 10, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum and the schools no longer qualify for the teaching posts in these classes. This was the sole criteria for selection of schools in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">In 2005, when the general allocation model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for mild general learning disability were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes.  Effectively, these schools received a double allocation.  The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the pupils into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for pupils with mild general learning disability cater for these pupils from within the general allocation model.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">As I have previously stated, the Minister is open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher, as the Deputy has referred to.  I understand that correspondence has been received in my Department from a number of schools in Dublin 10 in this regard.  My Department will be in direct contact with these schools on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years.  There are now approximately 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs.  There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared to just 2,000 in 1998.  Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">I take this opportunity to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for pupils with special educational needs.  The establishment of mild general learning disability classes pre-dates many of the developments in special education policy in recent years and we now have a system for providing schools with supports for pupils with high incidence special needs through the general allocation model.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">The natural sympathy we all have for pupils with special needs and their parents makes it all the more important that we do not cloud facts with emotion.  The parents of all children with mild general learning disability need to know that their children in mainstream classes are getting a quality education delivered by committed class teachers and supplemented by additional support from the resource and learning support teachers.  This is happening every day in schools across the country and will continue to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The Department of Education and Science has received correspondence on this matter from a number of schools in Dublin 10 and that correspondence is under consideration.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on this matter.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_760">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 54 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The sheep sector is a valuable part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Following on from the recent CAP Health Check, I received a number of submissions regarding possible future support for this sector.  One of my primary objectives in the Health Check Negotiations was to obtain access to unspent funds within the EU's agriculture budget for use by Member States with a wide range of discretion.  This was achieved in the final deal and, as a result, Ireland will receive additional funds amounting to approximately €7 million in 2009 (from the National Reserve) and €29 million in subsequent years, to fund measures that are targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">I announced yesterday my decision to use the €7 million available this year on a new Uplands Sheep Payment.  In reaching my decision, I recognised the difficulties and costs, including compliance costs, facing this sector.  I also wanted to ensure that this aid would not create any additional administrative burden for hill sheep farmers.  Subject to Commission approval, payments will commence on 1 December 2009, the first date that payments can commence under the EU Regulations.  Based on the estimated National Reserve funds for 2009 and the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from this payment.  The aid will be payable on mountain type grazing land up to a maximum of 15 hectares and based on the data available for 2008, it is estimated that the level of aid will be €35 per hectare and a maximum payment per farmer of €525.  This measure is solely for 2009.  A decision on the use of the unspent CAP funds and modulation monies from 2010 onwards, will be made when further information is available on the detailed rules that will apply to these measures.  The EU Commission will shortly table its proposals for the detailed rules for the use of the unused funds and it is expected that they will be finalised in May/June of this year.  It is important that these funds are used efficiently for the development of Irish agriculture.  All sectors, including, in particular, both hill and lowland sheep production, will be considered in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">This new support will complement the action taken on foot of the report of the Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group.  That report set the blueprint for the sector's future development.  While most of the Group's recommendations are to be implemented by the industry itself, a number of them fall within the remit of my Department and the state agencies under its aegis.  The current position regarding the implementation of these recommendations is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_765">A new company called ‘Sheep Ireland' which will take over the Department's current breed improvement programme has been established to develop a new programme.  An interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders has been established to oversee this process, with the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation (ICBF) providing the technical and professional service required.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">My Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep.  Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to €1000 in addition to his or her basic REPS payment.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_767">A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcase classification for lamb was conducted last year.  The results of this trial are being analysed.  It is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcases and will gain universal industry support.  This would aid greatly in price transparency, which is a pre-requisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_768">The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007.  This Scheme which is operated by Bord Bia, now has 7000 participants and it is hoped to increase the participation rate during the current year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_769">Bord Bia has intensified its efforts to promote lamb on home and export markets.  Together with its UK and French counterparts it is part of a generic promotion campaign on the important French market.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_770">Teagasc have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which include hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity to develop a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and to identify research and development needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The actions being taken by my Department and the state agencies under its aegis are in addition to those being taken by the Industry.  While such actions are continuous in nature and do not have a strict timeframe, I remain confident that they will help to underpin a viable future for the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The sheep sector benefits significantly from the main schemes operated by my Department — the Single Farm Payment, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS.  In addition, Bord Bia will spend some €1m on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad in 2009 and Teagasc has allocated around €1.5m for 2009 on sheep research activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">I announced yesterday that unused funds available in 2009 from the Single Farm Payment National Reserve would be paid to hill sheep farmers in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment.  The amount in question is approximately €7million in 2009.  These funds have become available as a result of a request by myself, supported by a number of my counterparts from other Member States, in the context of the Health Check negotiations, for the facility to use unspent funds from the national Single Farm Payment ceilings to fund measures targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Under the Scheme I announced yesterday and based on the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the new payment this year.  On the basis of data available for 2008, I estimate that the level of aid will be of the order of €35 per hectare with a maximum payment of €525 per farmer.  Payments will commence on 1 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">In introducing this payment my main objective was to address the difficulties and specific costs, including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector.  In reaching my decision I was mindful of the need to ensure that it created no additional burden for farmers and was simple and low cost to administer.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">This payment, for which I sought and secured the agreement of the Commission, is for 2009 alone.  I will make a decision on the use of unspent CAP funds from 2010 onwards when further information is available on the detailed EU rules that will apply.  I understand that the Commission will bring forward its proposals in this regard very shortly and they will be adopted in May/June of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">My Department has received thirty eight submissions relating to the proposed usage of €120 million in additional modulation funds. Under the Health Check agreement these modulation funds will be allocated to Ireland's Rural Development Programme over a four year period beginning in 2010.  This funding may only be spent on measures addressing the new and ongoing challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigation, renewable energies, water management, biodiversity, innovation measures relating to these areas and the restructuring of the dairy sector.  Submissions received cover a broad area including agri environment measures, energy crops, forestry, the dairy sector and environmental projects in rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">I am currently considering how these funds can be used to optimum effect to develop Irish agriculture within the terms laid down in the EU regulations and having regard to the current budgetary constraints.  All submissions received will be examined carefully and will be a useful input to the decisions on these matters.  Ireland's Rural Development Programme must be revised to incorporate the additional funding and submitted to the EU Commission by the end of June 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS.  Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments each year.  The first payment, of 75%, could be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme were completed.

            <p eId="para_792">While the Irish agri-food sector operates in a global market that is currently experiencing unprecedented change, I am optimistic about its long–term future stability.  Despite the well documented challenges in the global market, I believe that our indigenous industry has the potential to boost export returns and approach €10 billion in annual export revenues by 2011, as has been targeted by Bord Bia.  The strongest growth potential exists in dairy, prepared foods, beef, alcoholic beverages and seafood sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">This Government is strongly committed to continued support for the sector to meet the challenges and avail of the opportunities arising from on-going changes and developments in the international economic climate.  Action has been taken at all levels of the food supply chain in accordance with the Agri-Vision 2015 Report and the Programme for Government.  At primary production level these include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_794">Major on-farm investment in infrastructure, including waste management;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_795">A new Milk Quota Trading Scheme, which provides a more open market system of quota transfer and will increase the efficiency and competitiveness of milk production;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_796">An Enhanced Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) to promote environmentally friendly agricultural production;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_797">A suckler cow welfare scheme, the first of its type in Europe, to enable the beef sector meet consumer demands for animal welfare friendly beef production;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_798">The Single Farm Payment Scheme, which supports farm incomes, ensures sustainable agricultural production meeting broader societal demands;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_799">Measures to develop a sustainable forestry sector to support rural employment provide an indigenous renewable energy source and help mitigate climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">At the food industry Processing Level:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_801">The Dairy Investment Fund, amounting to €100 million exchequer funds, will generate total capital investment in processing of almost €300 million.  The Fund reflects the Government's recognition of the need for growth in output and value-added in dairy products particularly in order to exploit the new opportunities presented by EU quota expansion.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_802">Beef and Sheepmeat Investment Fund:  A Capital Investment Aid Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat primary processing sectors was launched in April 2007, with the aims of achieving efficiencies in processing and improving market sustainability, competitiveness and added value.  The process of examination and evaluation of project proposals under this scheme has been completed and Enterprise Ireland is in contact with companies about the details of awards.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_803">The Prepared Consumer Foods Initiative will provide around €30m over the next five years to progressive companies in the prepared consumer food sector through Enterprise Ireland's R&amp;D and Growth funds.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_804">Supporting Innovation, Marketing and Research and Development: Bord Bia has received increased funding in recent years to support the marketing of Irish foodstuffs and the development of Quality Assurance Schemes.  The planned transfer of responsibility for seafood from BIM to Bord Bia will enhance the marketing of seafood under the "Ireland the Sustainable Food Island" banner.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">Addressing the industry's capacity to compete successfully at home and overseas has assumed a new urgency and my belief is that a new development plan for the period to 2020 is required to maintain the impetus gained from the Agri-Vision 2015 strategy.  My Department has already started the preparatory work on this plan which is focusing on the opportunities arising from growing international food and energy crop markets, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and the critical issue of competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">The provision of education and training in agriculture is, under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, the responsibility of Teagasc.  It is for that organisation to ensure that the educational courses provided are appropriate to the needs of the industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">It is part of my role as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to support the sustainable development of the mussel fishing industry which is important to many coastal communities.  At all times in my actions as Minister I am bound by national and EU law and in particular by the judgements made by the European Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">In December 2007, the European Court of Justice found that Ireland was not in compliance with the Birds Directive in relation to aquaculture developments.  This judgement also had similar implications for the wild fisheries.  In essence, the judgement was saying that an ‘appropriate assessment' must be undertaken before aquaculture/fishing activities can be undertaken in any site identified as a Natura site under the Birds and Habitats Directives where they are likely to have a significant effect on the site.  Over the past year, my Department in cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government have been in negotiations with the European Commission on how we can work towards full compliance.  A Roadmap document which I am currently finalising with my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be presented to the European Commission in the very near future.  I am hopeful that with the Commission's agreement we can adopt an approach that leads to full compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives while providing for the sustainable development of the fishing and aquaculture industries.</p>

            <p eId="para_811">The retail sector played a very important role in the actions taken through the supply chain to restore consumer confidence following the dioxin incident.  The main priority was to get product back on the shelves with as little discontinuity as possible and the prompt action of the retail trade in this regard contributed greatly to achieving this.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The primary purpose of the contingency fund established by my Department was to remove and render potentially contaminated product.  It was intended to provide financial assistance to processors for loss of product and so ensure continuity of supply.  My Department has met with retailers to brief them on the scope of the financial assistance approved for EU state aid purposes which does not cover loss of profit at retail level.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">I am disappointed at reports of a small number of retailers seeking to charge suppliers for profits lost during the period.  My Department does not have a statutory role in relation to what are effectively contractual relationships between retail buyers and their suppliers but has pointed out the extent of the financial assistance scheme and sought the cooperation of all stakeholders in the food chain including the retailers.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">The total number of applications for REPS 4 received in 2007 and 2008 was 12,292.  As of today, REPS 4 payments have been made to 6,194 applicants or just over 50% of the total.  These payments amount to some €20.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments each year.  The first payment, of 75%, could be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme were completed.  These included checks on areas and on the plan details.  My Department's controls have to satisfy stringent EU regulatory and audit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Many REPS 4 plans were prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  The information on these plans is in computerised format and it was necessary to develop an appropriate computer based control system for checking these plans.  This was a lengthy process and the system was not available until late autumn.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of industrial action in my Department's local offices last year was that this process was delayed.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">The first payments for 2008 REPS 4 applications issued in the last week of January 2009 to those whose applications required no correction following the administrative checks.  Further payments continue to be made as applications are cleared.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_827">I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 76, 82, 110 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">We have an unprecedented situation in the dairy sector at present and the outlook for dairy markets in the short term is poor.  Following historically high prices in 2007 and early 2008 a market correction is now taking place and there is the added complication of the credit crunch.  These two factors have put an enormous burden on the sector and resulted in a slump in demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">I have maintained close contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel regarding the need for appropriate action to support the market.  The Commission responded initially with the early introduction of Private Storage Aid for butter and with the reintroduction of export refunds in January.  In addition the Commissioner gave a commitment to continue intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder under the tendering arrangements once the fixed limits were reached.  These were welcome developments and well judged at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">I met the Commissioner in Brussels on the 11th of March to discuss developments and explore the options open to us.  In particular I had two main issues to press her on.  The first was the need to buy butter into intervention at prices close to the fixed price level.  The second was to stress the need to export larger quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder to international markets.  I am pleased to report very positive progress on both these key points.  At last week's management committee meeting it was agreed to purchase a total of 6,665 tonnes of butter into intervention at levels very close to the intervention price.  This is a very important development.  In addition to this, increased quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder were granted export refunds at the same meeting.  In fact, the volumes supported with export refunds last week were almost equivalent to the combined totals of the three previous tenders.  This is a very welcome improvement and should help bring stability to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">I am encouraged by this progress in the use of EU support measures and I believe we have made some steps towards stabilising the market.  However, there is still room for improvement and the Commission's role in managing the market is crucial.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">At yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers there was a debate about the unprecedented situation in the dairy sector at present and the short term outlook for dairy markets.  I informed my colleagues that in Ireland we are entering a period of abundant supplies and the levels at which refunds and intervention function will be critical to the speed at which we emerge from the current slump.  While I was encouraged by recent developments in community support, I urged a short sharp utilisation of the market management measures to get the market back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.  It is clear to me that the elements that will lead this recovery are competitive refunds that allow the sale of dairy products onto world markets in considerable quantities and the continuation of intervention under the tendering mechanism provided that these arrangements remain relatively attractive.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">I expressed the view that there is a long way to go before we can see the market again performing at its optimum level and that achieving this is critical so that our industry at all levels continues to do sustainable business and build for the future.  There was a general consensus on the need to utilise all the market supports and I will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

         if he will provide a progress report on the delivery of the EU Commission fisheries fuel aid package agreed in July 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_835">The fisheries fuel aid package referred to is the EU Regulation 744/2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleets affected by the high fuel prices.  This was introduced to mitigate against the impacts that the escalating fuel prices had on the European fishing fleet in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">Recent developments in the global fuel market have resulted in cheaper fuel and a subsequent easing of the pressures on fishermen.  The crisis however did highlight areas within our fleet that needed further attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">Ireland's response to the adoption of the package of emergency measures was to submit a detailed, costed set of proposals to the EU Commission on 12th September 2008.  In keeping with our previous and consistent stance on the matter, and supported by the Commission's policy document of 8 July 2008, these proposals sought additional EU funding of €32m to support the restructuring of the fishing fleet in line with the provisions of EU Regulation 744/2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">We have pursued and continue to actively pursue the case at both Council and Commission level.  The Irish Plan was the subject of a lengthy bilateral meeting at official level with the European Commission in Brussels on the 30th September.  At that meeting the current situation of the Irish Fishing industry was outlined to the Commission and it was made clear that the Plan cannot be implemented unless the Commission secures and allocates the necessary funding to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">I have continued to press for Commission proposals to enable the implementation of the plan in Ireland at an early date.  The Commission's stated position is for Member States to re-engineer their Fisheries Operational Programmes to give priorities to the new measures catered for in the emergency package.  This is not an option for Ireland as we have already committed €32m of our total EFF allocation to the current decommissioning scheme which does not allow for any further flexibility with the remaining measures proposed.  We will continue to push Ireland's case at every available forum with a view to the Commission bringing forward firm proposals to provide additional funds that will enable the full implementation of the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">Movement restrictions were placed on 22 cattle farms to which contaminated feed was supplied.  In addition, restrictions were placed on a further 14 farms for further testing.  Positive results were found for 4 of these farms.

All the pigs on these farms have been slaughtered, with the exception of the pigs remaining on 1 holding.  This is due to the fact that under EU transport regulations sows within 2 weeks of farrowing and young piglets cannot be transported for slaughter.  It is expected that these remaining animals will be slaughtered over the coming days.</p>

         asked the

         if he will adopt a system of administrative sanctions for minor fisheries offences instead of the criminal sanctioning system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_848">Since 1959 Ireland has applied its criminal law in relation to fisheries matters and, since our membership of the European Community, Ireland has applied the criminal law in the enforcement of fisheries policy.  Successive Governments have applied the criminal law.  We do this to protect fish stocks and to seek to avoid financial penalties being imposed on the State and the Irish tax payer.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">However, it should be noted that all sanctions for fisheries offences are purely financial in nature.  The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 Act simply sets down the maximum financial fines that may be applied and it is a matter for a judge to determine the appropriate fine taking into account the specifics of each case.  The Act also applies, for the first time, a scaled approach to maximum penalties for infringements by vessels whereby smaller vessels are liable to lower maximum fines.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The possibility of introducing administrative sanctions was comprehensively considered at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill through the Oireachtas.  The position taken by the Minister at the time was based on the legal advice from the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">In the case of most fisheries offences European Community regulations require that penalties must be deterrent and dissuasive and must involve depriving the wrongdoer of the benefit of his or her actions.  The fines and forfeitures allowed for under the Act are, therefore, at a substantial level, and include, for example, the loss of the catch and fishing gear.  The Attorney General advised that under the Irish legal system such penalties would be viewed as criminal in nature and therefore could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution.  This position has been confirmed by the present Attorney-General.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The European Commission recently introduced a draft new regulation intended to update and reform the EU Fisheries Control framework.  This proposed regulation envisages facilitating a sanctions and penalty points system and allows for the application of administrative action or criminal proceedings in conformity with national law.  In this regard there may be a possibility of introducing administrative sanctions and a penalty points system for Irish vessels under this proposal.  Legal advice is being sought to determine if the current Commission proposal could accommodate their introduction here in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">It is worth noting that the proposal from the Commission envisages penalties up to a maximum of €600,000 for repeated serious infringement and under the penalty point system the suspension of a fishing licence for prolonged periods, even the permanent withdrawal of a licence.  These penalties are substantially higher than the level provided for in Irish legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_855">There has been speculation recently about the possibility of Iceland applying for membership of the European Union (EU).  As with any other European country, Iceland would not be "asked" to join the EU.

            <p eId="para_879">My Department's contingency arrangements to mitigate the risk of the introduction of the bluetongue virus into the country are based on existing EU legislation and an ongoing assessment of the risk to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">In terms of my Department's overall contingency arrangements, we have produced a comprehensive Bluetongue Contingency Plan for Ireland.  Information and advice leaflets on Bluetongue were sent to every farmer in the country, as well as specifically tailored advisory material to all members of the Veterinary Profession.  My Departments contingency arrangements are kept under constant review and revised as appropriate by reference to the developing disease situation or in the light of legal or other developments, particularly at EU level. In addition, we are also refining arrangements for delivery of a vaccination programme in the event that it becomes necessary to vaccinate here.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">In the meantime, I strongly urge Irish farmers and others not to import livestock from affected zones under any circumstances as this represents the biggest risk of the introduction of the disease.  I have made this clear to the farming organisations during the many briefings on bluetongue and have asked that they too use their influence accordingly.  I wish to re-iterate that any such animal found BTV positive to a PCR (virus) test on arrival here will be immediately slaughtered.  There are no compensation arrangements in place in the case of such slaughter.  Consequently, farmers and others should be aware of the possible financial risks that they may be exposed to in addition to the risk that such imports may pose to the national herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">The Government fully supports the EU commitments to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, and to scale up this reduction to as much as 30%, as part of a new global climate change agreement when other developed countries make comparable efforts.  The Government also supports the commitment to increase the share of renewables in energy use to 20% by 2020, including a 10% biofuel target.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">While it is recognised, both nationally and at EU level, that delivering emissions reductions in the agriculture sector will be difficult, it is also clear that any policy leading to a significant reduction in Irish cattle numbers, as a means of achieving emissions reductions, would be simply counter-productive in terms of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  Any fall in Irish beef and dairy output would simply be replaced on European and global markets, most likely, by food from countries where production systems are far less sustainable and where the carbon footprint of that food is significantly higher than food produced in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">Ireland's pasture based food production system is very efficient in terms of emissions per unit of food produced and offers the optimal means of safe, sustainable, high-quality food production.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">Globally, the consumption of meat and dairy products is expected to increase significantly by 2050.  In the interests both of global food security and of the pursuit of important market opportunities, the ability of the EU agriculture and food sector to respond to these developments needs to be encouraged and protected.  In that context, I will continue to press for the policy strategies needed both Nationally and at EU level to ensure that we meet our climate change goals in ways that are consistent with national objectives for our agricultural sector and rural economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 81, 93, 94 and 99 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I announced yesterday that unused funds available in 2009 from the Single Farm Payment National Reserve would be paid to hill sheep farmers in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment.  The amount in question is approximately €7million in 2009. These funds have become available as a result of a request by myself, supported by a number of my counterparts from other Member States, in the context of the Health Check negotiations, for the facility to use unspent funds from the national Single Farm Payment ceilings to fund measures targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Under the Scheme I announced yesterday and based on the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the new payment this year.  On the basis of data available for 2008, I estimate that the level of aid will be of the order of €35 per hectare with a maximum payment of €525 per farmer.  Payments will commence on 1 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">In introducing this payment my main objective was to address the difficulties and specific costs, including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector.  In reaching my decision I was mindful of the need to ensure that it created no additional burden for farmers and was simple and low cost to administer.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">This payment, for which I sought and secured the agreement of the Commission, is for 2009 alone.  I will make a decision on the use of unspent CAP funds from 2010 onwards when further information is available on the detailed EU rules that will apply.  The amount available is €25m approximately; the precise amount will be clarified when the detailed rules are revealed.  I understand that the Commission will bring forward its proposals in this regard very shortly and they will be adopted in May/June of this year.  As regards modulation monies the agreed rates of additional modulation will generate approximately €120 million in total over the four years from 2009 — 2012 in transfers from the Single Farm Payment to rural development.  In line with the new Regulations the funds must be used for measures to address the so-called "new challenges" of climate change, water management, bio-energy and biodiversity, dairy restructuring and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The consultation process as to how these funds can best be used for the development of Irish agriculture has taken place.  As I have said from the outset these additional funds will stay in Ireland and be passed back to Irish farmers under the Rural Development Programme.  The precise measures are subject to approval by the European Commission and I am currently evaluating the submissions made by stakeholders with a view to submitting an amended Rural Development Programme to the Commission by the deadline of 30 June 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">At the outset I should state that a full screening Regulatory Impact Analysis has been carried out by my Department on the CAP Health Check and the report is available on the Department's website.  That report outlines in some detail the expected impact of the Health Check proposals.   The final deal secured last November differs in some respects from the original proposals.  In summary, the deal I secured is worth a potential €80 million in additional payments to farmers over the coming years.  In addition, the increase in milk quota will deliver some €100 million worth of additional milk production by 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">As regards market support schemes, in essence, the key market management mechanisms that are most important to Ireland have been protected and are left unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">Good progress was also achieved as regards simplification and a commitment was secured from the Commission and the Council as regards further simplification.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">As to modulation, the rate was increased by 5% as opposed to the 8% originally proposed.  I am satisfied that we succeeded in getting the rate of additional modulation considerably reduced from the original proposals.  It is worth noting that over 50,000 Irish farmers will be exempt from this increase.  I can confirm that there will be a budget neutral effect in respect of the 70,000 farmers affected by the change as I have ensured that all the funds raised can be passed straight back to Irish farmers.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_937">A first policy debate on the future of the CAP after 2013 took place at the informal meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Annecy in September last.  In the initial debate, there was general agreement on the global context in which policy thinking must be developed.  All the ministers present were concerned about global food security, increasing environmental pressures and the impact of climate change, factors which have been reflected in recent food price volatility.  While a large majority of Member States favoured maintaining a strong EU agriculture policy, there were differences in emphasis from different Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The French Presidency took the discussion forward at a specially convened Council in November 2008 at which it presented a series of draft conclusions for discussion by Ministers.  The draft brought together aspirations on a number of broad challenges and generally understood principles on future CAP policy.  It took on board the commitments made in the final Health Check negotiations to further simplification and to address the differing levels of direct payments between Member States.  It also pledged that the conclusions were without prejudice to discussions on the Financial Perspectives.  Unanimous agreement could not be reached on the conclusions put forward by the Presidency and they were therefore agreed as Presidency, rather than Council, conclusions.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The Czech Presidency has signalled that its main priority will be to continue discussions on the future of the CAP including an examination of direct payments with a particular focus on the differences between Member States and the system of payments.  It intends to hold a full discussion on this topic at the Informal Agriculture Council meeting in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">My own view, which I have expressed at meetings of the Council and bilaterally to my Ministerial colleagues, is that we must maintain a strong agricultural production base in the European Union in the future to take account of the challenges ahead in meeting increased demands for food.  Any reduction in food production in the EU would be taken up elsewhere where less efficient production systems exist and would result in a heavier carbon footprint.   We must also undertake food production and distribution in a manner that is sustainable in all its dimensions — economically, socially and environmentally.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">There will be major challenges ahead from climate change, increased competition on world and EU markets, the financial crunch and other factors. We must ensure that we have the capacity to cope with the challenges and fully exploit the opportunities as they emerge.  To do so our whole sector, from farm to fork, must be highly efficient and competitive.  It must also be innovative, producing the products that changing consumer tastes demand, and it must be relentlessly focused on quality and safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">To achieve these objectives, there is a continuing need for an active and appropriately resourced European agricultural policy.  That policy needs to recognise the role that a cohesive agriculture &amp; rural development policy can play in addressing future energy needs, addressing environmental concerns and providing a secure and sustainable food supply in Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">I have made provision of €9.75m in 2009 to meet current commitments under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme and the preceding equivalent schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The Deputy will also be aware of my ongoing support for young farmers and new entrants to farming, most notably in the dairy sector. For example, the allocation of milk quota to new entrants and young farmers has been a feature of the milk quota system for a number of years. Preferential access to milk quota from a specially created priority pool was available under the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme until 2006, and the same priority pool arrangement is a feature of the current Milk Quota Trading Scheme. Indeed, the quantities of quota available to new entrants — whether farming on their own or in partnership with parents — have been considerably increased since the introduction of the latter scheme in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">In addition, the changes I announced last summer to the milk quota regulations are facilitating greater participation in Milk Production Partnerships, which is benefiting new entrants and young farmers in particular. There is now no limit on the numbers that can participate in a New Entrant/Parent Milk Production Partnership, and I have also made it possible for young, trained farm managers to enter into partnership with established milk producers.  And those that have previously been involved in beef or cereals production, for example, can now join forces with milk producers in developing their enterprises.</p>

The first payment, of 75%, could be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme were completed.

Letters have begun to issue to farmers whose applications have already been examined and found to be in one or other of those categories and these letters will continue to go out in the coming weeks.

            <p eId="para_957">The agri-food sector is Ireland's largest indigenous, manufacturing sector and is crucial to sustaining and reinvigorating the economy.  Strategies for the development of a consumer focused, competitive and sustainable agri-food sector capable of meeting the challenges of more liberalised markets and broader societal demands both at home and abroad are set out in the Agri-vision 2015 report and the Cawley Report.  These strategies identify the delivery of safe, high quality, nutritious food, produced in a sustainable manner in high value markets as the optimum road for the future of the Irish food industry in the light of the changes which have already taken place or are anticipated over the next number of years and span the entire food chain from primary production through processing to market access which is key to developing export potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">An inter-Departmental Market Access Group chaired by my Department and  comprising representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara is currently engaged in a co-ordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Bord Bia, under the aegis of my Department, is the state agency responsible for market development of food, drink and horticulture and closely monitors food exports.  It recently published a Strategy to boost food exports for the period 2009-2011.  The strategy comprises six key priorities to be addressed including enhancing the industry's position on its home market to capitalise on the potential for growth and expansion of exports with a particular emphasis on the Eurozone markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established an Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, to be run by Enterprise Ireland, to allow for meaningful additional assistance to be provided to basically sound internationally traded companies that would otherwise struggle to survive the global downturn. The fund will operate in conjunction with the banks and will supply direct financial support to eligible, internationally trading enterprises which are undertaking development expenditure to reduce costs and gain sales in recession hit overseas markets. The fund will complement the banks' commitment to SMEs under the recapitalisation scheme and should facilitate much of the restructuring that is needed for viable companies selling on the home market.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">During 2009 Bord Bia will implement a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and services, which have been developed in consultation with industry bearing in mind the impact of the sterling differential on competitiveness.  These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_962">Food Ingredients/Nutraceuticals (Europe), which will provide industry with detailed market requirements particularly for dairy ingredients.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_963">Participation in Trade Fairs in Paris, Madrid, Portugal and Amsterdam, mentoring on supplying Continental supermarket groups and provision of market insights.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">Brucellosis is now at a historically low level in Ireland. The last confirmed case was disclosed in April 2006.  If no case of Brucellosis is disclosed between now and the end March 2009, I intend to apply to the EU Commission in April seeking Official Brucellosis Free status for Ireland. At that stage, I would envisage a relaxation of some of the Brucellosis programme's control measures which will reduce the burden on farmers of testing and movement controls.  My Department has already met with representatives of the farming organisations to discuss possible changes to the programme. However, given the nature of the disease and as Brucellosis continues to exist in Northern Ireland, we will be adopting a cautious approach to reducing controls and any reduction will be phased over a number of years and will be based on an assessment of the risks involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">I must emphasise that any new outbreaks of the disease between now and April this year could jeopardise the attainment of officially free status. Consequently, I would urge all involved to continue to comply with the control and testing arrangements that remain in place and to exercise caution when sourcing replacement female animals.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 98 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">I recently launched Animal Health Ireland which aims to improve overall animal health standards, thereby enhancing on-farm productivity and securing improved profitability for farmers through a coordinated national approach to animal health.  This delivers on the commitment contained in the Programme for Government, referred to by Deputy Conlon, that my Department would "introduce a new Herd Health Initiative to deal with non-regulated diseases".</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The main priority of Animal Health Ireland will be to identify and prioritise non-regulated disease conditions that impact negatively from both a financial and disease perspective on Irish livestock, excluding those already covered by regulation.  Non-regulated diseases include mastitis, IBR and BVD.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Animal Health Ireland represents a significant change from the long-established Government-led model that has characterised animal health policy to date in Ireland.  AHI provides a unique opportunity to develop an improved understanding of current practices and future trends in international best practice in the area of herd health and affords those organisations — including farmers, producers, processors, and support/advisory service — actively participating in the project to build on the significant resources, informational infrastructure, capabilities and expertise already available within the range of organisations and, following on from that, to develop a national strategy to take appropriate action in the area of non-regulatory animal health, which in effect will allow industry to a large extent to shape its own future.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">My Department is cooperating fully with AHI.  As well as meeting some of the initial costs of AHI my Department is providing a small number of Executive staff and additional assistance by way of expertise to assist the interim Steering Group of AHI for a period. Work has commenced on the administrative arrangements to be put in place to support AHI, which will operate independently of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_995">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments each year. The first payment, of 75%, could be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme were completed. These included checks on areas and on the plan details.  My Department's controls have to satisfy stringent EU regulatory and audit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Many REPS 4 plans were prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  The information on these plans is in computerised format and it was necessary to develop an appropriate computer based control system for checking these plans.  This was a lengthy process and the system was not available until late autumn.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of industrial action in my Department's local offices last year was that this process was delayed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_999">The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent was in 2002 and the next is formally scheduled for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">Work has already commenced in preparation for the review with the publication of a Commission Working Paper in September 2008 and the launch of a phase of analysis and consultation. The French Presidency also held an informal Fisheries meeting in September (on the margins of the Fisheries Council) on the reform process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">A public hearing of the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament was held on the 10th February on the reform of the CFP, the highlight of which was a speech by Commissioner Borg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">It is clear from that speech that absolutely everything within the current framework of the CFP is open for discussion including the TACs and Quotas system and relative stability.  The whole question of the Hague preferences would also be open for negotiation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">In relation to quota allocations, the position is that Ireland's shares of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980s when fish stocks were being shared out between EU Member States. The share allocations were based on catch records and reflected the fishing levels of the Irish fleet and other Member states' fleets at that time.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">It has been a priority of successive Irish fisheries Ministers to try to have these shares improved.  During both reviews of the Common Fisheries Policy, in 1992 and again in 2002, substantial efforts were made to push Ireland's case for increased shares of important stocks but without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The practical reality is, however, that to achieve an increase in Ireland's share of catches, other Member States would have to take a cut in their shares.  This is all the more difficult to achieve when the total allowable catches (TACs) of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving support for such an outcome at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council, where quotas are fixed for the following year, is not deliverable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">Notwithstanding the fact that the TACs and Quotas system and relative stability are up for discussion as part of the CFP review, at this point the European Commission and other Member States largely take the view that the quota shares are fixed and not subject to ad-hoc changes pending any more fundamental review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The Commission is expected to publish a Green Paper on the review which will be up for debate at the April Agriculture and Fisheries Ministerial Council.  This will be followed by public consultation later in the year and a legislative proposal next year with a view to adoption in early 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">I am committed to working closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, other stakeholders and other like minded Member States to strengthen the current policy for the betterment of fisheries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">Refunds of Modulation under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme began issuing to farmers last week and, to date, refunds amounting to some €24 million have issued to over 122,000 applicants. Modulation is the process whereby a percentage of each farmer's Single Payment is transferred to fund rural development measures in Pillar 2 of the CAP. In excess of 80% of the sum deducted is used to fund rural development measures in Ireland. Modulation deductions are provided for in legislation governing the implementation of the Single Payment Scheme and a refund of the deductions on the first €5,000 is also provided for. While individual farmers are not liable for the modulation reduction on the first €5,000 paid under the Single Payment Scheme, Member States are required under the EU rules of the Scheme to make the deduction from all Scheme beneficiaries in the first instance and make the necessary refunds later. However, I am particularly pleased that agreement has been reached, under the recently concluded Health Check negotiations, whereby we will no longer be required to make deductions for Modulation in respect of the first €5,000 of a farmer's Single Payment. This is a sensible change to the rules and one for which I argued strongly.  This change is with effect from the 2009 Scheme.</p>

On the Irish market, a series of promotional campaigns have commenced and they focus on building awareness and loyalty to the Bord Bia Quality Mark. These will underline the quality of Irish pigmeat and will communicate its origin.  A customer reassurance programme will continue in export markets. This will entail:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1023">Continued direct Bord Bia contact with customers, placing key information about the Irish pigmeat industry in context and demonstrating the integrity of Irish health controls;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1024">A trade communications programme designed to position the capability of the Irish pigmeat sector and the safety and quality measures in place to influence key decision makers in the retail, food service and manufacturing sectors; and</p>

            <p eId="para_1027">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation.  In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling.  However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.  We will continue to pursue the issue of origin labelling at EU level in the context of the current review of the labelling Directive and in the context of the review of EU quality policy for agricultural foodstuffs.  I would point out that products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1034">New rules restricting fishing vessels' days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU's revised Cod Recovery Plan.  These rules are applicable to all vessels greater than 10m in length.  There is no provision in the rules to allow for any kind of blanket exemption to vessels that happen to be greater than 10m and less than 12m in length.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">The plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings (expressed in kilowatt-days) for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to the national level.  Member States have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea (ICES area VIIa) and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland (ICES area VIa).  The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of an EU Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each Member State in the areas during a reference period of 2004-2006 or 2005-2007 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), The Irish Fishermen's Organisation (IFO) the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am prepared to make amendments where proposed by the Steering Group within the legal framework that has been established.</p>

            <p eId="para_1038">The draft Commission Regulation implementing the Health Check changes has been under discussion at the Direct Payments Management Committee for some months and was discussed again at a meeting on 18 March.  The draft Regulation provides for a continuation of the provisions relating to the consolidation of entitlements which is applicable to all Member States including Ireland.  The main change for 2009 and subsequent years is that following the Health Check agreement, land that gave right to a single payment in 2008 and has since been afforested continues to be regarded as eligible land for the purposes of the Single Payment Scheme.  Farmers need not therefore avail of consolidation in these circumstances.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1079">The Government is strongly committed to the development of exports as a driver to expand the economy and sustain employment, and our enterprise support measures are very much geared towards helping companies to consolidate and grow their sales in existing markets and to expand their footprint into new and emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Enterprise Ireland is the State Agency charged with assisting indigenous enterprises to grow their exports in world markets.  The Agency is active both nationally at the developmental level and, internationally in assisting Irish companies to find new markets for their products and to increase their existing level of market share.  Through its network of international offices, Enterprise Ireland creates and implements successful strategies for market entry, development and growth in overseas markets.  IDA Ireland client companies make up a very significant proportion of overall exports and the IDA also has a range of measures designed to help client companies to embed their operations in Ireland and to grow employment and exports.  Within the last few weeks, the Taoiseach has announced the establishment of an Enterprise Stabilisation Fund to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies.  This Fund is an important first step in the process of concerted support for our trading enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Against the backdrop of the current global economic downturn, a range of additional measures is currently being assessed with a view to further helping exporters and businesses generally.  Various proposals have been suggested and a thorough assessment of possible supports will shortly be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">There have, in addition, been several major instruments introduced to support enterprises generally.  The banks recapitalisation scheme, which includes a provision to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises by 10%, was one such carefully designed measure.  This major development, coupled with a new Code of Practice on Business Lending, will be a crucial source of support for our exporting companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Having regard to the continued concerns of the business community in relation to the issue of credit generally, an independent study on credit availability has been commissioned by the Department of Finance, as part of the bank recapitalisation programme.  I understand that this study, which will also address the issue of credit insurance and trade finance generally, is due to be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">In relation to the possible introduction of a State Export Credit Insurance scheme, I recently requested that a separate review of the export credit insurance market be carried out by Forfas and Enterprise Ireland.  This report has just been finalised and I will be bringing its findings to Government shortly for discussion.  It should be appreciated that any intervention by the State in the area of trade finance must have regard to the effectiveness and tangible benefits of such a scheme for exporters generally, in light of potential significant additional costs to the exchequer.  The Government will be considering the facts and possible policy responses to this particular issue within the next few weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 requires Government Departments to report each year on details of their accounting practices.  While I have not carried out an analysis on the speed and efficiency of payments made by Government Departments and public bodies to private businesses, an examination of the Annual Reports of Government Departments shows that, in general, the level of late payment interest incurred is small relative to the huge volume of payments made by Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The Government is nevertheless very much aware of the cash flow difficulties currently being experienced by SMEs.  In this regard, the Taoiseach announced on 5 March 2009, that the Government is introducing, on an administrative basis, a commitment to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments from 30 to 15 days and that an assessment will be completed by end-April of the impact of extending this to the local authority, health and education sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">My Department is currently working on the specifics of implementing these new arrangements and I will be bringing proposals in this regard, to Government shortly.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1129">I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">Unemployment is increasing across the country due to the downturn in the economy and this has impacted on County Mayo also.  This situation is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the CSO.  It does not provide data on particular counties but only on a regional basis.  Based on the latest available data, which is for Quarter 4 2008 (Sept — Nov), unemployment has increased by 10,700 in the West Region over the 12 month period to Quarter 4 2008.  Specifically on a county basis, live register figures for Mayo, which are not designed to measure unemployment show an increase of 4,842 over the year from February 2008 to February 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The Government is taking specific measures to address the ongoing challenges in the labour market and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible and for as short a time as possible.  The National Training and Employment Authority FÁS are providing a range of supports through its offices in Ballina and Castlebar, to assist the unemployed secure employment as soon as possible.  These supports include jobsearch specific skills training for the unemployed and access to work experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">In the Ballina Training Centre a wide range of evening course programmes are available to help the unemployed and those in employment who wish to up-date their skills or learn new ones.  The programme content for this year includes training in such disciplines as welding, roofing, accounts &amp; payroll and safety, health and welfare at work.  In addition FÁS is planning to provide a further four full-time and two part-time courses throughout Co. Mayo offering training to an additional 250 people before mid 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The Enterprise Development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are committed to facilitating job opportunities in Co. Mayo.  Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with 129 client companies in County Mayo, with an associated employment of 3,016.  From 2007 to-date Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of over €11.6 million to companies in County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">IDA is also committed to the development of County Mayo and through its network of overseas offices.  IDA is actively marketing the county for new inward investment while, at the same time, continuing to work with its existing base of overseas companies to encourage them to grow and expand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">The Government remains intent on achieving greater capacity within existing resources to meet the on-going challenges in the labour market, inclusive of County Mayo.  We will, through FÁS, continue to focus on providing training opportunities to those who are unemployed to improve their skills, increase their employability, thereby enabling them to get back into employment as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1139">I have been informed by the Agency that, from 2006 to date in 2009 there have been a total of seven first time visits by prospective investors to Co Mayo and one return visit.  These investors represented the medical technologies, ICT, International Service and pharmaceuticals sectors.  To date, no investment has resulted from these visits.  However, there is often a lengthy gap between the visit and a decision to locate a project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1144">Financial help for those who are unemployed and wish to retrain or upskill in order to find alternative employment is payable through a FÁS training allowance.  FÁS training allowances are available for most FÁS courses with the exception of Evening and Online courses.  The current rates are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">15/16 year olds: €83.25 (€47.95) part time</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">In cases where a trainee's social welfare entitlement exceeds any of the amounts set out above, a training allowance equivalent to this entitlement will be paid on receipt of certified evidence, namely a "Participant Allowance Entitlement" form.  In addition to this a training bonus payment of €31.80 is payable to the following categories of people who were on, or commenced, a FÁS training course on or after 19 April 1999:</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">Persons in receipt of Jobseeker Benefit or Jobseeker Allowance for 12 months or more;</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">All FÁS services are open to people with disabilities.  FÁS provides vocational training for the unemployed and new entrants to the labour market through specific skills training and traineeships.  FÁS also provides training for those in employment through apprenticeships and in-company training.  A person with a disability may call into a FÁS Employment Service Office for information, advice and guidance in relation to vocational training and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">FÁS also contracts with 20 Specialist Training Providers such as the National Learning Network, in 55 centres country-wide to deliver training courses to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in FÁS mainline training provision.  People with disabilities may be supported while in employment by FÁS through the following programmes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1160">The Wage Subsidy Scheme, which was launched in September 2005, provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ people with disabilities who work more than 20 hours per week.  The subsidies are structured under three strands and the employer can benefit from one, or all, simultaneously. Disabled employees who meet qualifying conditions are also able to avail of the Back to Work Allowance that is available through the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1161">The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing people with disabilities with supports to help them access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations on behalf of FÁS who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">Under its funding for Disability Supports and Awareness services, FÁS also operates a series of private sector employment supports to assist people with disabilities to access and progress in employment.  It also includes supports for employers.  Programmes under this heading include: Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, Job Interview/Personal Reader Grant, Employee Retention Grant, Disability Awareness Training Grant.  Further details on the above programmes and supports are available on the FÁS website www.fas.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">The total funding for dedicated FÁS programmes and supports for people with disabilities for the years requested are set out in Appendix 1. In addition to the above-mentioned programmes and supports, people with disabilities may also avail of work experience and training under the Community Employment (CE) Programme.  The total number of people with disabilities availing of CE and the overall CE budget for the relevant years are contained in Appendix 2.</p>

         her policy in relation to the funding of training for people in employment; if there has been a diversion of funding from this sector to providing training for those who are unemployed; if so, her views on the way this is impacting on business competitiveness here; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [11659/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_432">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1216">The State makes a significant investment in training measures for both employed and unemployed.  The amount of funding invested in those in employment has increased significantly over recent years and has been used to facilitate a broad range of upskilling programmes, ranging from basic literacy and numeracy to specific skills or support to build the management capabilities and skills within companies to help them achieve their business goals.  Such upskilling for those in employment is provided through the various agencies of my Department together with Skillsnet Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">Currently the Government is examining how to optimise the provision of education and training for those in employment and those seeking employment against the background of the current economic situation and the forthcoming supplementary budget.  As companies search for greater productivity and competitiveness in order to retain existing business in the current international marketplace, investing in skills continues to be important, both for survival and growth.  Such investment will also help to retain and enhance employability, particularly of those workers with low basic skills.  Within the limits of current budgetary constraints we will continue to concentrate on developing those management skills that will lead to real and immediate business impact in terms of strategy; leadership; international marketing and selling; innovation management; and taking a leadership role in developing the national management stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">In order to meet the challenges of the changing economy there will also be a policy emphasis on activation and training for the unemployed.  This includes a focus on those most recently unemployed, where additional opportunities for training and re-skilling are being provided.  In the current economic climate it is important to ensure that such people can avail of relatively immediate upskilling to best position themselves to re-enter employment with improved skills, which will also help increase our competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">As regards competitiveness more generally, our immediate policy objectives are to restore confidence and stability in our economy, provide supports to the enterprise sector, restore cost competitiveness, safeguard the significant achievements of recent years and to ensure a return to sustainable export growth.  I believe that we have to take concrete steps to show solidarity with enterprise and in particular the exporting sector.  Restoring cost competitiveness is a particular focus of action.  Cost competitiveness remains critical to ensuring that companies based in Ireland have the ability to compete successfully in international markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">The Government introduced the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, called"Building Ireland's Smart Economy", in December 2008 which sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland's move back to economic growth and prosperity.  The Cabinet Committee for Economic Renewal is driving this strategy and we will continue to pursue policies that will build on our strengths, address our weaknesses and maximise economic activity and employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1224">Financial and non-financial assistance for small businesses and services in Ireland is delivered by a large number of bodies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) (www.enterpriseboards.ie), Enterprise Ireland (www.enterprise-ireland.com) and FÁS (www.fas.ie).  The individual concerned should, in the first instance, contact their local CEB, who will then advise how best to proceed further with their venture and in the event of not being able to assist them will re-direct them as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">County and City Enterprise Boards</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">The 35 CEBs were set up in 1993 to provide support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer (micro-enterprises) in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The forms of financial assistance which are available from the CEB network, subject to certain criteria, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants, and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, e-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.  CEBs may provide grant assistance to micro-enterprises (ten employees maximum) in the start-up and expansion phases in manufacturing, tourism and services, provided the promoter can demonstrate that the project is commercially viable; will not displace jobs elsewhere in the economy; will focus upon new initiatives in fields where they can best fill gaps rather than duplicate provision; will involve the creation of sustainable employment; requires grant assistance to enable the project to develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">However Boards are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  The entrepreneur may contact his local CEB through the national website as noted above, or direct to the Limerick County Enterprise Board at Lissanalta House, Dooradoyle, Co. Limerick (Telephone No. 061 — 496520, Fax No. 061 — 583954 or email: ).</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">Enterprise Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">Enterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. It supports companies employing ten or more people and start-up companies which have the potential to employ ten or more people and reach or exceed €1 million in exports over three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Encouraging and supporting innovation-led high potential start-up companies (HPSUs) with an export focus is a key priority for Enterprise Ireland and is fundamental to building the next generation of world-class Irish companies. Enterprise Ireland offers a wide range of services, including financial and non-financial supports to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">When this question was first answered on 10 March, the redundancy claim form (RP50) and the EAT determination had, in fact, been lodged in the Department but had not been entered on the system due to the very significant increase in the numbers of claims received.  The claim was subsequently entered and the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is now in the process of completing administration checks on the lump sum claim for the statutory redundancy payment to the person concerned.  Payment is expected to issue by the end of this week which will be just outside our customer service target of 6 weeks for lump sum payments.  Procedures are being put in place (including the allocation of additional staff) to cope with the huge administrative burden on staff in the Redundancy Payments Section including ensuring that an efficient tracking system for claims received in the Department is in operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1235">The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport.  We would like to see the SR Technics Group do what it can to facilitate this, such as helping to promote the capabilities and skills available at the Dublin facility, agreeing to an orderly wind down of the facility to give IDA Ireland an opportunity to promote the location to interested parties, and maintaining assets and equipment at the site for at least six months.  I have conveyed these points, and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at Group level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in acquiring at least elements of the business and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively exploring options with interested parties.  Time is needed to assess these proposals by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support in the normal way.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1238">Minimum rates of pay, and other conditions of work for workers in certain sectors, are determined by Joint Labour Committees (JLCs).  JLCs are statutory bodies established by the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.  Each JLC is composed of representatives of workers and employers in the sector concerned.  The pay and conditions agreed by the JLCs are given the force of law in Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) made by the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts on foot of proposals made to the Court by the JLCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">For the past number of years, the Catering sector has been covered by two separate JLCs, one covering the Dublin region and the second the rest of the country.  Over the years, each of the JLCs in the Catering sector has agreed a set of terms and conditions to apply to the workers covered by its remit.  In circumstances where both Committees have operated independently of each other, the terms as agreed by the two Committees have differed in various respects. In particular, workers covered by the Dublin ERO are entitled to time plus one third for Sunday work, while workers outside of Dublin must be paid double time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">I am aware that the approach to determination of the Sunday premia which applies under the EROs for the catering sector has given rise to concern for the continued viability of services provided by catering establishments and the sustainability of employment in many areas.  In this regard, it is my understanding that the employer and trade union interests in the catering sector have reached a preliminary agreement to fix a uniform set of terms and conditions (including the harmonisation of the Sunday premium).  I strongly urge the parties to take the necessary action to ensure that these uniform terms and conditions are given effect as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1242">FÁS as an agency of my Department operates the Community Employment (CE) and Job Initiative (JI) schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.  The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">Participation on Community Employment and Job Initiative has an upper age limit of 65 years of age, i.e. a participant/supervisor can remain on the programme until the day before their 66th birthday, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements.  FÁS cannot make funding available to a sponsor for any participant or supervisor aged 66 years or over.  To do so would mean that the State would effectively be double-funding both the CE/JI place and the participant's state pension simultaneously.  This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS Employment Schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the schemes under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1250">I have no plans at present to add this occupation to the list of job categories ineligible for work permits.  However, applications for work permits for meat de-boners will continue to be subject to a strict labour market needs test intended to maximise opportunities for filling of vacancies from within the Irish labour market and wider EEA.  In addition, in order to facilitate the development of a wider indigenous skills pool for the meat industry, my Department through its key training providers FÁS and Skillnets, supports the provision of a number of FETAC accredited training programmes for butchers and de-boners.  Such training provision recognises that the development and maintenance of skills are pivotal to keeping this key export industry operating in a competitive and efficient manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">According to a 2008 study conducted by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in FÁS for the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, there were 6,300 butchers/meat de-boners employed in Ireland in 2007 of which 850 were from outside of the EU. Data for 2008 indicates a decline in the numbers of non-Irish nationals employed in this sector and an increase in the proportion of Irish nationals employed.</p>

This Scheme provides for payment of certain entitlements owed to employees by their employer at the time of liquidation.  These entitlements include arrears of wages, holiday pay, and pension contributions. While the regulation of pension funds is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Insolvency Payments Scheme can reimburse certain pension fund contributions in an insolvency situation.  Section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 provides for payment into an occupational pension scheme of outstanding employer and employee contributions which were due to be paid in the 12 months prior to insolvency. This provision transposes Article 8 of the EU Directive which requires that Member States shall ensure that the pension entitlements of employees are protected in the event of an insolvency.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1260">Issues relating to the school curriculum and to higher education are policy matters for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, who is responding separately on these points.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">I consider it vitally important that our education system provides the skills required by our enterprise sector. The 2008 Forfas national skills bulletin pointed out that current shortages of high level IT skills (software, IT services, systems integration, electronics/IC design, automation and process control) are expected to persist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">My Department funds the Discover Science and Engineering programme, which is run by Forfas. Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) is supporting the "pipeline" to the knowledge economy by encouraging more students to take up careers in the physical sciences and in engineering. DSE, through its extensive programmes supports the science curriculum at primary and second levels and encourages more students to take an interest in science and engineering and subsequently to study those subjects at third and fourth level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">DSE's primary school programmes focus on learning about the science in the world around us. Over 90% (3,000) of primary schools participate in its programmes where the emphasis is on learning-by-doing rather than on rote learning. This programme therefore encourages key skills such as scientific observational techniques and teamwork, which are so essential to the modern knowledge economy. Also, there is a strong emphasis on interactive ICT skills in this programme. The two key programmes here are Discover Primary Science and Greenwave.ie, an environmental and climate centred project and in both case schools submit and interact via the internet. In the case of the former new learning modules are delivered on the internet also.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Similarly, at second level and in support of the Junior Certificate science curriculum DSE focuses very much on the development of key learning skills for the knowledge economy. Here it is currently working through its Sensors programme with nearly 200 schools by supporting their use of electronic data gathering equipment which the students use in their project work. In addition, DSE with its partner Intel through the Scifest programme is promoting science and engineering project work at local level. In this programme students are encouraged to compete by submitting their projects in competitions hosted at each one of 12 local Institutes of Technology. The key internet support here is ProjectBlogger which hosts discussions amongst students on their project work. Similarly DSE supports the national display of science and engineering project as a Gold Partner of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">In addition, DSE promotes careers in technology by working closely with Engineers Ireland and the Cork Electronic Industries Association and by also promoting these careers as a partner to CareersPortal.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">My Department also funds ICT research and development through Science Foundation Ireland. SFI invests in research teams that generate new knowledge and leading edge technologies fostering competitive enterprise activity in the fields of science and engineering underpinning ICT, biotechnology and energy. In the ICT area, SFI investment includes software, hardware and their combination. One of the important outputs of that funding is a growing stream of PhD graduates in areas of ICT closely linked to the needs of Irish industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">The Deputy will be aware that Financial Regulator published its Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears on 13th February in keeping with the Government's announcement on recapitalisation arrangements.  This Code applies only to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal residence in the State, by all regulated entities operating in the State. Under the Code, where a borrower is in difficulty, the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until at least six months from when the arrears first arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">The Deputy will appreciate that a balance must be achieved by Government between influencing private banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the day to day running of these institutions which must operate on a strictly commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with consumers in light of their assessment of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers.  The decision of borrowers is influenced by factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">Generally mortgages are for long periods.  To some consumers a fixed interest rate on a mortgage offers peace of mind in that the borrower benefits from certainty regarding the cost of the mortgage, does not need to be concerned with changes in mortgage interest rates and accordingly, can budget more confidently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Interest rates charged by banks generally vary in line with the base rate fixed by the European Central Bank from time to time.  Where a bank offers a fixed rate over a certain period it incurs additional costs in obtaining fixed or other funding in respect of the loan over the period.  The additional costs will reflect both the market view in relation to future trends in interest rates for the period and the fact that longer term deposits generally attract higher interest rates than short term.  In addition, where a customer changes from a fixed interest rate contract to a variable rate contract before the end of the term for which the interest rate was fixed, there is an associated cost to the lender.  In circumstances that lenders were prohibited from passing on this cost to borrowers switching to variable rates, this cost could increase the price and reduce the availability of fixed rate mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">I have no function in setting interest rates for banks covered by the guarantee scheme and I do not propose to introduce additional requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1337">The decision on whether an institution operating in Ireland passes on ECB interest rate cuts to customers is a commercial decision for the institution concerned.

            <p eId="para_1338">The Deputy will be aware that many lenders are conducting extensive advertising campaigns, showing that competition is a real factor on the mortgage scene. The existence of that level of competition in the mortgage lending market is sufficient, I believe, to ensure that credit institutions will reduce their rates where possible in order to remain competitive and retain their share of the market. I understand that in general credit institutions differentiate between mortgages of owner occupiers and residential investors for the purposes of setting mortgage interest rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">I have been informed by the Financial Regulator that all of the covered institutions have fully passed on each ECB interest rate cut to owner occupiers since the bank guarantee scheme was introduced and that this will be so for the latest ECB cut announced on 5 March 2009.  I have also been informed that since the bank guarantee scheme has been in place, on average, cuts in ECB rates have been passed on within one month of the ECB announcement allowing time for adjustments to administrative support systems.  I welcome the decision of lenders to pass on ECB interest rates in full to their home mortgage customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1362">In the case of second-hand cars a special VAT scheme is in place in Ireland, following strong representations from the motor industry, rather than the Margin Scheme operated in most other Member States. The special scheme allows motor dealers, at the time of purchase, to claim credit for residual input VAT which is considered to be included in the cost of acquiring a car from a customer.  When the car is subsequently resold, the VAT is chargeable on the full sale price of the car or on the original purchase price paid by the dealer, whichever is the higher.  This is necessary because the dealer has already been granted a credit in relation to the residual input VAT incurred.  The special scheme allows dealers the maximum benefit by allowing an immediate deduction of residual VAT at the point of purchase.  The VAT credit already allowed on second-hand cars must, despite the industry's view, be seen for what it is, i.e. money advanced to dealers by the Exchequer which they are only repaying when they resell the second-hand cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">Although with the changing economic circumstances dealers have found themselves selling traded-in second hand cars at a loss, which is increasingly giving rise to clawbacks of VAT situations for dealers, it is not possible to write-off the VAT credit already allowed to the dealers on second-hand cars. In this context the Revenue Commissioners have however granted concessionary treatment which allows dealers to postpone payment in respect of the clawbacks over the past number of months until 19 May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">I am not opposed to the introduction of a Margin Scheme for second-hand cars, but not on the basis, as is being proposed by the motor industry, that the outstanding VAT credit already provided to dealers in relation to their existing stock of second-hand cars would be written-off in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1449">Ireland has had a long standing policy, for sound health and social reasons, of applying high excise rates to alcohol products. Consequently, Ireland has the highest excise rate on wine in the European Community, and the second highest in the case of beer and spirits. Nevertheless it should be noted that excise duty has not been increased on beer since Budget 1994, on cider since Budget 2002 and on spirits since Budget 2003. Excise duty on wine was increased in Budget 2009 by 50 cent per standard bottle, having remained unchanged since Budget 1994. The overall decline in excise yields in 2008 reflects the general slowdown in economic activity.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the motor industry in Germany is reporting a 21% year on year increase in new car sales in February, despite Germany being in recession and having an unemployment rate in excess of 8%, due to the introduction of a stimulus package for the industry which pays consumers €2,500 to replace a car at least nine years old with a new car; the amount a similar package would cost the Exchequer if it yielded similar increases in new car sales here; the amount it would yield in extra tax revenue; his views on introducing a similar package in the forthcoming budget as a means of reviving the motor industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1543">House Mortgage Finance: Similar to total personal sector lending, house mortgage finance experienced year-on-year growth rates of over 20% between Q1 2004 and Q1 2007.  Since then growth rates have declined markedly and stood at an annual rate of 5.8% at end-2008.</p>

Negative annual growth rates in the first two quarters of 2006 resulted from reclassifications.  At end-Q4 2008 this category had an annual growth rate of minus 1.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">Credit Card Debt: The high growth rates seen in 2004 and early 2005 are as a result of the expansion in the number of banks reporting credit card debt and do not represent trend growth.  In Q4 2008, personal credit card debt reached its lowest annual growth rate, at 5.3%, since the series began.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">The income levy is deducted on any payments of income made on or after 1 January 2009.  The income levy legislation provides for a refund after the end of the year where there has been an over-deduction of levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">On an administrative basis the Revenue Commissioners have advised employers and pension providers that where they are satisfied that an individual under the age of 65 years will only have an individual income from them of less than €18,304 annually, or where aged over 65 years, irrespective of marital status, an income less than €20,000, then they should not deduct any income levy.  These administrative arrangements are highlighted in the Frequently Asked Questions on the Income Levy which are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/spotlights/income-levy.html</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Where these arrangements are applied, the income levy will only be deducted in cases where there is likelihood that there will be a liability for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">In the case of the exemption for those aged over 65 who are married, the legislation provides for a refund after the end of the year because it would not be possible for either the Revenue Commissioners or an employer or pension provider to know during the course of the year whether or not all of the requirements necessary for the exemption to apply have been met.  This would include knowing, for example, if the person or their spouse had turned 65 in the tax year, if they had other income sources and the aggregate income from these sources, if there had been a change in employment circumstances or if there had been a change in marital status during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">Revenue would not be in a position to establish many of these matters until after the end of a tax year and, accordingly, the legislation provides for the exemption to apply on the basis of a person making a repayment claim after the end of the tax year.</p>

Statutory responsibility for other public service pension schemes is a matter in the first instance for the respective Ministers in other Departments, as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1853">It should be noted that there is no provision in the civil service superannuation schemes to cap civil service pensions as referred to below.  Having said that, based on the current number of civil service pensioners, the amount which potentially would be saved on an annual basis, if the maximum pension a person could receive in respect of reckonable service was capped at €60,000 would be about €7.7m; at €75,000, it would be about €3.7m; and at €100,000, it would be about €1.3m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">The potential savings from the caps referred to above in the future would be affected by the numbers retiring in the different bands of pension payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2082">I am informed by the Financial Regulator that AIB is the covered institution with the most significant exposure, at 6.2% of total loans, to central and eastern Europe.  This is because it is the only domestic institution with a direct interest in banks in the region. I am also informed that the other covered institutions have minimal exposure, at less than 1% of total loans, in the listed countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2084">Under statutory pension schemes and pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners there is no liability to income tax in respect of retirement gratuities or lump sums paid to members of such schemes on retirement. Provided the individuals referred to in the question are members of such a scheme and the lump sum payments comply with Revenue rules in this area, there is no liability to income tax on the retirement lump sum payments. In this regard, it should be noted that the tax arrangements for retirement lump sums apply in respect of pension schemes in both the public and private sectors.</p>

I would however point out that as the Deputy will be aware, the Social Insurance Fund derives its revenue in the first instance from PRSI inflows which are paid direct to the Fund and do not form part of Exchequer receipts (though they would of course be taken into account in calculating the General Government Balance). Thus the Exchequer position for 2009 would only reflect Fund transactions in circumstances where a subvention from the Vote is needed to maintain the Fund in balance. During 2009, the Fund will have a substantial operating deficit reflecting the worsening labour market conditions. However, the accumulated surplus of the Fund built up over several years can be called upon in the first instance to address the operating deficit. At 1 January 2009, the accumulated surplus stood at just over €3.4 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2100">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the numbers of income earners availing of the one parent family tax credit for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 are estimated at 131,400, 136,700 and 136,600 respectively. Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">The numbers availing of the credit represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the one parent family tax credit and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost. They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax credits were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2005 adjusted as necessary for income and employment growth for the years in question and are therefore provisional and subject to revision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">The one parent family tax credit is a credit that can be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, single, deserted, separated or divorced) who has a dependent child resident with him/her for the whole or part of the relevant tax year.  When applying for the one parent family tax credit income earners are not required to include details relating to the dates of the child's residence or maintenance in their tax returns. There is, therefore, no statistical basis on which the Revenue Commissioners could provide an estimate of the numbers sought by the Deputy in relation to these details.</p>

The appropriate criteria and weightings are specified by the contracting authority concerned, having regard to the requirements and characteristics of the contract.

            <p eId="para_2174">I propose to take Questions Nos. 222, 223 and 444 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">The Adoption Bill 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, was published on Friday 23rd January.</p>
            <p eId="para_2176">Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible. A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which will it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation. There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago. This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">In December 2008, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement which will expire on 1 May 2009. The Vietnamese Authorities have responded positively to Ireland's request.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a draft bilateral agreement for intercountry adoption was delivered on 6 March, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">I would like to again reiterate my personal commitment and the commitment of the Government to conclude an agreement with Vietnam and, in this regard, a letter accompanying the draft agreement advised the Vietnamese Government of our willingness to travel to discuss the draft at the earliest opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">As the Deputy will be aware, it is important to recognise that Ireland has a long and positive relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and to also emphasise the need to respect the authority of that jurisdiction, having regard to the sensitive nature of discussions regarding intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and the implementation of Government's decisions is being given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration. At all times, the Minister and the Government, and officials advising them, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2244">I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 284 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, was published on 23rd January, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">A core principle of the Hague Convention is that intercountry adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child's interests must be paramount. Legislating for intercountry adoption is essential to give protection to children in the process of adoption. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction. As a receiving country it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">I firmly believe that legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague Convention provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child. As such, it is our intention that intercountry adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have ratified the Hague Convention, and from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards. As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care which cannot be provided domestically. We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">As regards the Russian Federation, my Office is undertaking preparatory work to consider the contents of such an agreement, including anticipating the likely requirements of the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">However, at this point in time, it is my priority to endeavour to ensure that an international bilateral agreement with Vietnam is put in place as soon as possible, to maintain the continuity of arrangements between Ireland and Vietnam in relation to intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">In this regard, I am pleased to confirm that a draft bilateral agreement for intercountry adoption was, on March 6th, delivered through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">Furthermore, in a letter accompanying the draft agreement, the Vietnamese Government has been advised of our willingness to travel to discuss the draft at the earliest opportunity.</p>

In such cases there would normally be another person who would have been assigned as the patients next of kin. In general, this is the person the doctors would talk to in relation to the patients diagnosis and prognosis. This person would then inform any other relevant persons, including family members. The doctor and his or her team, as a matter of good practice, would meet with other family members if requested to do so. This issue is amongst the many that will be considered in greater detail when the Department is formulating a policy on dementia, the scoping of which will commence later this year.</p>

This investment has helped to increase the number of approved consultant neurology posts which now stands at 24 compared with 14 in 2003.

            <p eId="para_2270">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010, under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">Services participating in the CCSS receive annual funding on the basis of the number of qualifying parents recorded as using the service in a particular reference week, generally set in late September of each year.  Services may apply mid-year to have their funding reviewed, where they believe they would benefit from additional funding as a result of having additional numbers of qualifying parents.  In 2009, services have been advised that they should request a review by 19 March and that the reference week will be that ending on 3 April.  Where a review results in an increased level of funding, this will be calculated with effect from 1 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">As the funding is paid on the basis of the number of qualifying parents using a service at a particular point in time, the increase in funding will apply from that date and cannot be applied retrospectively.  It is also noted that the facility for a mid-year review is optional and services with lesser numbers of qualifying parents are not required to seek a reduction in their grant level.  I am satisfied that the arrangements in place are satisfactory and provide for much greater flexibility than was the case under the previous support scheme, under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP), which allocated funding for a period of 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">I understand that services participating in the CCSS have been provided with detailed guidelines regarding the scheme, by the Childcare Directorate of my Office.

            <p eId="para_2280">The IBTS have introduced a number of risk reduction measures to decrease the likelihood of vCJD being transmitted by blood transfusion.  These measures include donors being permanently excluded from donating blood who have had neurological surgery or eye surgery, including laser treatment, in the UK on or after 1 January 1980.  Persons who have had an adenoidectomy, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, splenectomy or lymph node biopsy in the UK on or after 1 January 1980 are also permanently excluded.  This measure was introduced in November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">Also excluded are persons who have had root canal treatment performed in the UK on or after 1 January 1980 unless it can be established that the person's dentist used only single use disposable files and reamers. This measure was introduced in October 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">These particular operations were thought to be of particular concern as they either involved neurological tissue, or tissues such as tonsils, appendices, lymph nodes or spleens in which abnormal prion protein had been found.  The concern with the instruments was that they may previously have been used on patients who later went on to develop vCJD.  Even if the instruments were thoroughly cleaned and sterilised after surgery, there was a concern that abnormal prion protein could have adhered to the instruments and could therefore be transmitted to other patients who were subsequently operated upon using these instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">Donors who have had other operations in the UK are not excluded from donating as long as the underlying condition is not in itself a reason for deferral, they have fully recovered from the operation and a blood transfusion was not required.

            <p eId="para_2287">In accordance with the Department of Finance Instructions relating to the appointment of Ministerial Private Office Staff,   three of my Ministers of State, Ms Máire Hoctor T.D, Ms Mary Wallace T.D and Mr John Moloney T.D have appointed two civilian drivers each,  who work on a week on -week  off  basis. There is a one-point pay scale for civilian drivers, who are paid €667.43 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">There are no drivers employed directly by either myself or my colleague Mr Barry Andrews T.D., Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Children and Youth Affairs. Minister Barry Andrews is entitled to a State car on the basis that, as Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Children and Youth Affairs, he attends Government Cabinet Meetings. Under a long-standing arrangement, all Government Ministers are provided with a State car which is driven by a member of An Garda Síochána from a pool of Gardaí allocated on a full-time basis to Ministers.  These Gardaí provide personal protection in addition to their driving duties.  The cost of this service is funded from the Vote of An Garda Síochána and individual rates of remuneration are not readily available.</p>

While the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with the (HSE) and Pobal, was involved in the assessment of projects sent forward for consideration, as the lead agency the HSE is responsible for the contractual arrangements involved in each of these projects. The Government recently announced its intentions to examine all current and capital expenditure as part of its decision to introduce further measures to stabilise the public finances.  All decisions on funding will be taken in the course of these deliberations and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

A response to this request is awaited.  I am aware that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, met a delegation from the Irish Association of Creative Arts Therapists on two occasions last year to discuss this specific issue.

The group in question was approved capital funding of €1.2 million under the programme in May 2008.  However, capital grant approvals under the programme are subject to satisfactory completion of all pre-contractual requirements, including the need to meet the relevant timeframes that apply.  I understand that the group has not yet met these requirements.  Therefore, I am not in a position to comment on whether their grant application will proceed to contract and drawdown.  I understand that decommital of the group's grant approval is being considered under rule 1, "Failure to sign contract", and rule 2, "Failure to comply with financial and statutory obligations, and/or meet management/governance standards".  If it is decided to decommit the grant approval, the group will be informed of the position and its right to appeal at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_4249">Diabetes is a common metabolic condition that affects approximately 1 in 20 people in Ireland. It carries a risk of medical complications, including peripheral arterial disease, which on occasion, requires surgical amputation of the affected limb. In 2006 my Department published its policy "Diabetes: Prevention and a model for Patient Care". This set out a model of care based on shared care between primary care and specialist services and which emphasised prevention as a key element. In November 2008 the Health Service Executive published the report of its Diabetes Expert Advisory Group to take forward and implement the policy recommendations. This represents a blueprint for the development of services for patients with diabetes over the coming years. It is patient focused, emphasises prevention and highlights foot care as a critical component of diabetes care.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4297">I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 468 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">The Board of the HSE met on 12 March and reviewed its projected financial position.  Following discussion with my Department and the Department of Finance the best estimate of the projected financial shortfall was of the order of €480m in the current year.  Since then the latest Department of Finance projections on the shortfall in health contributions has been revised upwards from €100m to €160m.  The HSE Board previously identified €133m in savings which will not impact on the Service Plan activity levels.   The HSE is to identify proposals to achieve further savings of €72m to deliver total adjustments of €205m.  I have also advised the HSE that Government will consider the remaining projected shortfall in the context of its overall deliberations on the expenditure and revenue measures necessary to ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">I have requested the HSE to focus on the measures required to be implemented to deliver the services set out in the Service Plan within the allocation that will be given to it following the most recent Government decisions on public expenditure.  I have also initiated the necessary consultation process required under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act to address the reductions in professional fees being sought by Government.  The HSE has also been requested to seek further economies in the areas of travel and subsistence, advertising, PR, consultancy and legal costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">Reducing payroll costs is an essential plank of the HSE's strategy for managing its emerging budgetary difficulties this year.  Health service delivery is very labour intensive and pay makes up a large part of health service expenditure.  Premium payments and overtime add large costs to the pay bill.   I have been advised by the HSE that it has a number of proposals designed to address these issues and contain the increasing pressures on its payroll.  Among  its proposals are the redeployment and/or reassignment of staff; reducing the volume of overtime worked; reducing on-call arrangements; reducing the use of agency staff; replacing nurses with health care assistants, and the rigorous management of all absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4301">My continued priority is the protection of patient services to the greatest degree possible.  I have indicated to the board of the HSE that I believe that the best approach would be to focus at this stage on the measures needed to deliver the level of services outlined in the service plan.  Ongoing contact will be maintained between HSE management and officials from my Department to track the various cost pressures and the steps that may be needed to be taken in response to these pressures by the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_4303">Details of the number of medical card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. The most recent medical card figures provided to my Department by the HSE are for January 2009. The total number of medical card holders on 31st January 2009 was 1,356,469. The following table shows the monthly increases in medical cards from January 2008 to January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4304">It is not possible to be definitive about the number of people who may apply for or be granted a medical card during 2009.  However, having regard to the decline in the economy and the associated growth in numbers on the Live Register, the HSE Service Plan for 2009 provides for a net increase of 81,000 medical cards and 46,000 GP visit cards in 2009. The Executive estimates the average full year cost of a medical card at €1,650 and a GP visit card at €380.  The HSE and my Department will be monitoring closely the trends in relation to medical card numbers throughout the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4344">I presume the Deputy is referring to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC which has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.   One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.  This matter remains under consideration at European Commission level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4345">The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006. The Irish response to this Discussion Paper gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people, those on medications and various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue. A working document on the setting of maximum and minimum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements was drawn up as a result of the responses from industry, consumer groups and national governments to the Discussion Paper.  The Commission has proposed in the working document that in the case of certain nutrients where studies have indicated there is evidence of no, or low, toxicity even at high level dosage, that it may be possible to waive the setting of maximum levels.  The Commission consider this a proportionate approach which is in line with the principle of Better Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4346">While the Irish position remains one of precaution for the reasons set out above, we will take account of Irish consumers' views and those of industry in adopting a position during those discussions. In this regard the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) Consultative Council hosted an open meeting on 27th January 2009 to discuss the issues relating to food supplements. This meeting was attended by a cross section of stakeholders and outlined details of new developments in European legislation, which regulates food supplements and food fortification. The meeting outlined the rationale behind proposed EU regulations to safeguard consumer health in relation to food supplements and an insight into why consumers take food supplements and their understanding of the perceived health benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_4347">Officials from both my Department and the FSAI are involved in ongoing discussions at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop their thinking on this issue and our final position will be based on these discussions and on the scientific evidence presented to Member States during the discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4359">The issue of capital investment at the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, and the relocation to an alternative site, have been the subject of discussions between the Health Service Executive and the hospital authorities.  The HSE recently published the Review of Maternity &amp; Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area, conducted by KPMG Consultants.  The review included a recommendation that services currently provided at the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital should move to Tallaght.  The findings of the review have been welcomed by the hospital authorities, including the Master of the hospital who has expressed to me and to my officials his strong personal support for the overall findings of the report.  The HSE has begun the process of developing an implementation plan to deal with the key recommendations.  My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the additional issues raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4402">The economic review of the small public service vehicle sector published recently by the Commission for Taxi Regulation demonstrates that there has been a 25% increase since 2005, to approximately 100 million trips per year, in the demand for taxi services but also that taxi drivers are operating in a more competitive market than ever as a result of the increased supply of vehicles, that drivers are working longer hours than in 2005 and that average earnings have dropped slightly despite an 8% increase on maximum fares in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">The Commission for Taxi Regulation will now be consulting widely with the sector and the public at large on the economic review.  The Commission will also be seeking the views of the Taxi Advisory Council before any final determinations are made by it.  I will consider the outcome of this process together with the views of the taxi industry, consumers and consumer interest groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_4404">It should be noted in relation to working hours, that S.I. No 191/1963 Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulation 1963 as amended, requires that a licence-holder shall not drive a public service vehicle for more than eleven hours in any one day in any period of three consecutive days.</p>

The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.</p>

            <p eId="para_4865">As I made clear in my reply to Question No. 191 of 28 January 2009 matters regarding the development of Cork Airport, the Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick Masterplan, runway resurfacing, runway extensions and intentions to sell existing lands are operational matters for the Dublin Airport Authority in collaboration with the Cork Airport Authority.  I have no function in these matters. Neither have I any function in relation to DAA correspondence with the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4866">I can confirm that the DAA is not included in the schedule of public bodies that are covered by the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003. The main reasons for its exclusion are that it is a fully commercial company operating without any exchequer assistance and if it is to compete successfully with other international Airports it is imperative that it retains the right to confidentiality in relation to its own business and that of its customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4868">The detailed planning and design of the upgrade works on the Maynooth line is a matter for Iarnród Éireann. The works planned for the Maynooth line provide for the electrification of the line and also for the removal of level crossings and for re-signalling that will allow for a significant increase in trains per hour from 7 currently to 17 trains per hour. The Maynooth line will also benefit from the introduction of services from Pace once the first phase of the Navan rail line has been completed in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4869">The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the outcome of the statutory approval and procurement processes and the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. My priority for public transport is to deliver additional capacity across all modes, and major projects, such as the Dart Underground, will be hugely important in this regard. The redevelopment of the Maynooth line is an integral element of the Dart Underground project.</p>

Furthermore, there is ongoing co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI, including the exchange of intelligence, to ensure appropriate measures are in place to combat the terrorist and criminal activities of these groups.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that there are no plans at this time to request army personnel in support of the Gardaí in this context. For operational reasons, it is not the practice nor would it be in the public interest to comment on the number of persons involved in such groups in the specific areas to which the Question referred.</p>

            <p eId="para_4875">The immigration case histories and up to date positions of the first and second named persons concerned, a husband and wife, are almost identical. As a result, for the purposes of the Deputy's Question, I will deal with the two cases as one.</p>
            <p eId="para_4876">The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State on 25 February 2003. Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the persons concerned had previously made asylum applications in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the persons concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purposes of having their asylum applications examined there. The first named person concerned appealed the determination in respect of him to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The second named person concerned also appealed the determination in respect of her but that appeal was refused as it was not submitted within the specified time period. A Deportation Order was signed in respect of the second named person concerned on 6 May 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4877">The first named person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in his case. The High Court refused the Judicial Review Leave Application with the consequence that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Minister stood. A Deportation Order was signed in respect of the first named person concerned on 3 August 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4878">The persons concerned initiated further Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the Minister's decisions to make Deportation Orders in their cases. Following the conclusion of those Proceedings, the Deportation Orders were revoked on 31 July 2006 and the persons concerned were re-admitted to the asylum process at the commencement of the process. The couple had a child born in the State in late 2006 and this child was included as part of the asylum application of the second named person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4879">The new applications for asylum were refused following the separate consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were informed, by separate letters, dated 15 January 2009 in the case of the first named person concerned and dated 14 October 2008 in the case of the second named person concerned, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them and their child. They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. In addition, they were notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The persons concerned have submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and these applications are under consideration at present. When consideration of these applications have been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4880">In the event that the Subsidiary Protection applications are refused, the case files of the persons concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this latter consideration has been completed, the case files are passed to me for decision.</p>

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. Applications for certificates of naturalisation are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_4903">I wish to advise the Deputy that on 28 January, 2009, prior to the release of the convicted sex offender, a member of An Garda Síochána from Glenties Garda Station called to the family of the injured party and advised them of the pending release of the convicted offender. I understand, however, that prior to this notification the family had been informed of the pending release of the convicted offender the previous day by another source. I have asked the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to ensure that the notification requirements as set out in the 2001 Sex Offenders Act are strictly applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_4904">As the Deputy will be aware the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, effective from 27 September 2001, requires certain persons to be subject to notification requirements under Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. All sex offenders are monitored in accordance with the provisions of the Act and there is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. Standard procedures are that the nominated Garda Inspector is notified when a sex offender, who is subject to the requirements of the Act, is to reside in the area. Child Protection issues, should they arise, are notified to the Health Authorities, as set out in the Children First Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_4905">I am advised that the convicted offender, who is subject of the requirements of Part 2, Sex Offenders Act, 2001, reported to An Garda Síochána, Glenties Garda Station in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Act. I should also advise the Deputy that I published a Discussion Document on the Management of Sex Offenders last January which is designed to foster informed debate on recommendations on how we manage higher risk offenders, including achieving a greater degree of responsiveness across all the agencies of the criminal justice system who interact with a convicted offender. My Department has sought submissions on the Document which is available on my Department's website by the end of April, 2009 and I look forward to seeing the range of views that the consultation process will bring.</p>

From October 2006 netting has been placed around the exercise yards which have an external boundary with Glengarriff Parade. This netting is approximately 20 foot in height and is placed over the exterior walls which stand at 20 foot in height giving a total height of wall and netting of approximately 40 feet. Since the start of January 2009, 32 packets containing drugs and 8 mobile phones have been prevented from entering the prison by the netting. In addition, Prison Officers are detailed to patrol the external perimeter of this wall on a daily basis. Mountjoy Prison also maintain close links with local Gardaí in relation to this issue and Gardaí regularly patrol the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4972">The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4973">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4974">An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in April 2008.

            <p eId="para_5003">The Equality Authority launched, on 4 March 2009, its new Strategic Plan for 2009 to 2011, entitled "Equality for All in a Time of Change". It has been widely acknowledged that the Plan represents a new direction for the Authority to enable it to meet its complex mandate, and recognises the changing financial circumstances in which all public service bodies are operating. The stated position of the Authority is " to work towards its goal with more modest resources during the period of its new strategic plan, noting that this may limit what it spends, but not what it may achieve". I have arranged to have copies of the Plan placed in the Oireachtas library. The details can be accessed on the Authority's website at www.equality.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5004">Discussions have been ongoing between my Department and the Authority on its cost base.  The savings, already announced in relation to accommodation and IT, have enabled the Authority to concentrate on its core programme objectives of working towards the elimination of discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity.  The Deputy will appreciate that no review of funding of any public body at present can operate without reference to the grave Exchequer position.</p>
            <p eId="para_5005">Under the Plan the Authority is open for business at both of its offices, in Birchgrove House, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary and in Clonmel Street, Dublin.  I recently agreed in principle to a request from the Chair of the Equality Authority to delay on hardship grounds the transfer of 4-5 staff to Roscrea. I have asked my officials to work out the details on a case-by-case basis with the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Authority and to review the situation again in 2011 when other aspects of the wider decentralisation programme are due to be reviewed. I understand from the Equality Authority that fifteen staff have taken up duty at the Roscrea offices of the Authority, a total which will increase to 23 people in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5006">The Roscrea office is providing the Authority's national public information centre as well as other legal, administrative and development functions.  The Roscrea team has developed a new outreach role, at key local and community levels, throughout the Midlands, the South and the South West.</p>

            <p eId="para_5009">The Employment Equality Act 1998 provides for a review of its operation with a view to assessing whether there is need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in the Act. A review has been carried out. It included a Round Table Conference involving the social partners, relevant Government Departments, the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court. Possible new grounds, such as socio-economic status were discussed. As part of the process, UCC Law Department was subsequently commissioned to carry out a comparative review of the international experience of employment legislation. Following completion of this review, the Government decided not to add to the existing nine grounds contained in the Employment Equality Acts. However, operation of the Acts continues to be reviewed in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5010">The Equal Status Act 2000 also provides for a review of its operation to assess whether there is need to add to the discriminatory grounds covered by the Act.

The production of statistics at very small levels of geography increases the risk of disclosure, particularly of crimes that are low volume.  The CSO's obligation to preserve confidentiality is outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Central Statistics Office and An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_5023">I am also informed that the CSO's judgment is that given the nature of the offences and the small geographic area, providing the data requested by the Deputy would pose a risk of disclosure.</p>

The RIA is satisfied that the accommodation provided is perfectly adequate for this purpose.</p>

His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the then Asylum Division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, on appeal, by the then Asylum Appeals Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5087">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 27 October 1999, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.  Following consideration of the case of the person concerned, the Minister signed a Deportation Order in respect of him on 1 December 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_5088">The person concerned subsequently made an application to remain in the State based on his parentage of an Irish citizen child.

The Deportation Order made in respect of the person concerned was subsequently revoked.</p>
            <p eId="para_5089">On 11 August 2004 the person concerned was notified that the Minister had decided not to renew his permission to remain in the State.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

The IBC/05 application of the person concerned was refused as it was deemed that he was not a person of good character and he did not appear to be playing an active role in the upbringing of his Irish citizen child. The person concerned was made aware of the refusal of his IBC/05 application by letter dated 8 September 2005.</p>

Throughout this time, no asylum seeker in need of accommodation from the State has remained homeless.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">Regular unannounced inspections are carried out in all reception and accommodation centres to ensure that standards are being maintained and that value for money is being achieved. A serious view is taken by the RIA if proprietors fail to meet their obligations. Breaches in this regard have led to the closure of a number of centres in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_5123">The RIA constantly monitors the rates of payment to the providers of accommodation.  In recent years increases in the rates paid by the RIA were modest and below any "real-term" inflators when tested against the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  In light of the current pressure on the public finances, RIA is actively engaging with all its contractors with a view to reducing expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5124">As I indicated in my reply of 25 February, 2009 to the Deputy, the Government agreed to a new round of Value For Money (VFM) reviews for the period 2009-2011.  One of the expenditure programmes on the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice to be the subject of such a review is the spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation. The review will take place over the course of 2009, the results of which will be presented to the Oireachtas upon its completion.</p>

            <p eId="para_5445">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the costs associated with the training of student Gardaí until graduation cut across many different areas, including catering costs, salaries, allowances, training equipment etc.  I am also informed that once a student Garda is attested at phase four of the training programme, after 58 weeks s/he goes onto the 1st point of the normal Garda pay scale.  Accordingly salary costs for Gardaí between this point and their graduation cannot be separately identified. Under the circumstances I am advised that to approximate a cost per student Garda to the time of graduation would therefore require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of Garda time and effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_5446">Garda authorities have however provided the following details of annual costs for the years in question from their Financial Management System which was introduced in 2004, the earliest date from which this financial data can be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_5647">As I have already stated in reply to Question No. 125 on 4 March 2009 a general policy has been in place for a number of years to the effect that religious and volunteer workers in the State should remain for a maximum of 3 years.  However, this policy, while remaining in force, has not been rigorously applied and such volunteer workers have on a case by case basis been facilitated with further renewals, although it is not intended that such permissions be open-ended.</p>
            <p eId="para_5648">The particular immigration status given to religious and volunteer workers indicates that they are not entitled to participate in the labour market.  It was also understood they are dependent on their employing church or organisation for their upkeep, finances, and medical expenses or the person concerned could of course organise their own private medical insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5649">My Department is currently reviewing the policy in relation to religious and volunteer workers and when that process is completed the terms and conditions governing this category of temporary migration will be set out clearly for the benefit of all parties.</p>

These negotiations are focussed on progressing the Negotiation Phase of the project across financial, technical and legal aspects of the project.  This involves the continuation of the design development of the project and contract negotiations to enable the Irish Prison Service to contract with the PPP Company and commence construction of the prison facilities.  Construction will commence immediately after contract award and should take no more than 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">Pressures on the international financial markets have the potential to impact on all major capital projects, including the Thornton Hall PPP project.  It is the responsibility of the commercial consortium, under the PPP process, to arrange the funding and other resources to deliver the project.  The Irish Prison Service is being advised by the National Development Finance Agency in relation to trends and developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">While negotiations on the contract are at an advanced stage they have not yet been completed to the point that the Project Agreement can be signed.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is anticipated that it will not be possible to have a contract signed until later this year.  This timeframe is subject, of course, to the successful completion of the contract negotiations.  It is not appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, for me to comment on the specific details of the contract negotiations currently in progress.  I can say, however, that if the current contract negotiations are not successfully concluded there are other options which can still be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5657">The cost of the acquisition of the site for the prison development was €29.9 million.  The cost of the site was largely offset by the sale of the prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main prison site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5658">A total of €11 million has been expended to end February 2009 on professional fees (€6.1m), site preparation and surveys (€2.7m), landscaping (€0.4m), security (€0.5m) and the acquisition of the additional land for the access road (€1.3 m).  As is the case in all major infrastructural projects, comprehensive geological, engineering and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site.</p>

            <p eId="para_5660">One of the priorities I have set for An Garda Síochána in 2009 is to target serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug related crime.  This is being done through a range of measures, including the use of Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5661">Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, including the area referred to by the Deputy, in 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  Significant resources will continue to be allocated to the Operation.  Following the ringfencing of €20 million for it in 2008, €21 million is being ringfenced in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5662">I am informed by Garda authorities that local Garda management is satisfied that there is no reduction in Garda operations and policing responses under Operation Anvil in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5694">The gathering of the information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the number of prisoners on temporary release from Cork Prison on 20 March, 2009 was 64.</p>
            <p eId="para_5695">The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.  Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_5696">Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means which include the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. The periods of temporary release granted can vary greatly from a few hours following a family bereavement to, for example, a requirement to report to the prison every 12 months in the case of a life sentence prisoner who was released into the community a considerable time ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_5759">Garda actions and initiatives to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour are part of the policing functions carried out by An Garda Síochána in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the priority I have set to preserve peace and public order in co-operation with local communities, in particular by targeting disorder arising from binge drinking.  One of the six strategic goals set out in the Garda Policing Plan for 2009 is to significantly reduce the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in our communities.  Personnel, equipment and other resources are allocated at national and local level by Garda management to meet this and the other goals.  This includes the provision of additional foot and mobile patrols in areas identified by Garda management as "hot spots" when offences are likely to occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is operated in accordance with the provisions of the Children Act 2001, and the necessary resources to achieve this are accordingly allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_5761">The Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service, work in tandem with the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people aged 12-17 years of age who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects were first introduced in 1991, and there are currently 100 Projects operating in different locations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5762">These projects have been provisionally allocated funding totalling €8.666 million in 2009.  There is also funding available to the Projects under the European Social Fund for the purposes of improving the employability of project participants.  This ESF-supported programme within the Garda Youth Diversion Projects has been provisionally allocated funding of €3.850 million in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5764">Ireland's Embassies and Consulates overseas provide a range of services to Irish citizens, Irish businesses and the Government. There are currently no plans to cut back on the level of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5765">The costs of running most of these overseas missions are met from the administrative budget of Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs).    A 6% reduction in the Vote 28 administrative provision in Budget 2009 over Budget 2008 has already been implemented.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5816">Ireland's Ambassadors are primarily drawn from the rank of Assistant Secretary and Counsellor/Principal Officer within the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5817">The authorised number of high level posts in the Department of Foreign Affairs comprises one Secretary General, four Second Secretaries, five Deputy Secretaries and 42 Assistant Secretaries. Of these 52 posts, 38 are assigned to Ambassadorial posts. In addition, there are 25 Counsellors/Principal Officers and one First Secretary also serving as Ambassadors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5818">29 of these Ambassadors are assigned to locations which are designated as "hardship" posts. This designation takes account of local factors such as security, health, climate, cultural affinity and general quality of life. Posts are graded according to the level of hardship, ranging from Grade I (highest) to Grade III.</p>
            <p eId="para_5819">A hardship allowance is paid, as part of the overall system of Foreign Service allowances, to compensate officers serving in such locations. The amount paid to an officer varies according to grade, the degree of hardship and the local cost of living. The total cost of the payment of this allowance to eligible Ambassadors in 2008 was approximately €274,000 and is estimated to be €298,000 in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5820">The Ambassador in hardship locations, regardless of grade, receives an entitlement of up to 20 days additional annual leave per year. However, in many cases, officers do not have the opportunity to avail of this leave due to pressure of work and resource constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_5821">Officers assigned to the posts which are placed in the two higher categories of "hardship" (Grades I and II) Officers assigned to the posts which are placed in the two higher categories of "hardship" (Grades I and II) are also entitled to a "getting out trip" once per year up to the cost of an economy rate return fare to Ireland. The total cost of such travel by eligible officers and their families in 2008 was in the region of €32,000 and it is anticipated that the cost in 2009 will be similar.</p>
            <p eId="para_5822">The Department's management has in principle approved a new approach for the regulation of hardship posts. When implemented, this will replace the current arrangements with a more flexible and transparent system which will allow hardship levels at various locations be reviewed more frequently in line with changing local conditions and, if appropriate, re-designated. The new proposals include changes to the calculation of hardship allowances, a reduction in the number of posts designated as hardship, increasing the categories of hardship from the current three to five and a reduction in the additional leave allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5823">Discussions with the staff associations on the proposed changes to this system are ongoing, and subject to their outcome, it is planned to implement the new system later this year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5829">I utterly deplore the horrific humanitarian situation which exists in parts of war-torn northern Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p eId="para_5830">According to recent reports, more than 2,800 civilians may have been killed and 7,000 others wounded in fighting between the Government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE over the last two months. Hundreds of children are believed to have died and more than a thousand have been injured. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navi Pillay, has said that ‘certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law', citing repeated shelling by government forces of safe zones set up to protect civilians and reports of the LTTE holding civilians as human shields and blocking those who try to flee. The LTTE actions, the Commissioner suggested, should be examined to see if they constitute war crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">I have been following the situation with grave concern. In a statement issued on 8 February, and in reply to Parliamentary Questions on 10 and 12 February, I called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for full access to be granted for humanitarian relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">Since then, at our meeting on 23 February my EU Foreign Minister colleagues and I expressed our deep concern about the evolving humanitarian crisis in the northern part of the country and the vast number of Internally Displaced People trapped by the fighting there, as well as the continuing reports of high civilian casualties.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">In particular, we stressed the need for both the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to comply with the provisions of international humanitarian law and the principles of the laws of war. We called for an immediate cease-fire to facilitate full and unrestricted access to the conflict area, allowing humanitarian aid to be safely delivered and civilians to leave. We condemned the use of violence and intimidation by the LTTE to prevent civilians from leaving the conflict area and urged the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that the temporary camps for IDPs and the screening process for access to them are in compliance with international standards and that independent monitoring is allowed. We also called on the Sri Lankan authorities to take decisive action to tackle human rights abuses and to guarantee press freedom.</p>
            <p eId="para_5834">I underscored these points to the Sri Lankan Ambassador when I met him on 25 February. I spoke to him in particular about our deep concerns in relation to the humanitarian situation in the country, which is affecting not only Tamil civilians but the entire population. I also stressed the importance of addressing the underlying causes of the conflict through a comprehensive, negotiated, political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5835">Our concerns about the serious humanitarian situation have been repeated at international fora since then, most recently in the Irish statement to the 10th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, which was delivered on 16 March last. EU Foreign Ministers also discussed the situation in Sri Lanka again at the GAERC meeting in Brussels on the same day.</p>
            <p eId="para_5836">We continue to take the firm view that there can be no lasting military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties. A lasting peace settlement will require reconciliation and a political process aimed at protecting the interests of all the citizens of Sri Lanka and enshrining the principle of parity of esteem among its divided communities. Should the relevant parties seek our advice in relation to a negotiated peace process, we would give consideration as to how we could best help.</p>
            <p eId="para_5837">Since 2005, the Government has provided, through Irish Aid, more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka. Over US$12 million was allocated to Sri Lanka in 2008 from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, to which Ireland is currently the seventh largest donor.</p>
            <p eId="para_5838">In addition to our regular un-earmarked funding to the Red Cross — one of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the humanitarian crisis — the Government, through Irish Aid, is monitoring closely the humanitarian situation in northern Sri Lanka. The possible provision of emergency funding is kept under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5874">Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board. This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5875">My Department's primary role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the Section 481 tax relief scheme. This scheme is kept under regular review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any enhancements necessary to retain or regain competitiveness are addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate. The scheme was amended and enhanced in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and most recently in 2008. The amendments in 2008 extended the scheme for a further four years until the end of 2012, increased the overall ceiling on qualifying expenditure from €35m to €50m, increased the individual investor cap for those wishing to invest finance in film in Ireland to €50,000 per annum from the previous limit of €31,750 and increased the relief on that investment to 100% from 80%. Approval from the European Commission to introduce these changes was secured last week and the Minister for Finance subsequently signed the Commencement Orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5876">I believe that these adjustments to the tax investment scheme will assist Ireland in remaining competitive and will be a catalyst in securing filmmaking opportunities for this country. The film industry is the cornerstone of a smart and creative digital economy and the new provisions in Section 481 will sustain and grow employment in this sector in the years ahead, grow our production capacities and help to embed this key creative industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_5881">The International Sports Tourism Initiative was introduced by the Government in 2000 to support the then Bord Fáilte's efforts in attracting major international sporting events, with tourism potential, to Ireland. Since its inception the International Sports Tourism Initiative has supported a total of 148 international sports events in Ireland.  Together these events have attracted widespread international media coverage and a considerable number of additional overseas visitors to Ireland, generating significant revenue for the Irish exchequer. Major events have included the Ryder Cup matches, two rounds of the World Rally Championship, the Irish Open and in May this year, the Volvo Ocean Race.</p>
            <p eId="para_5882">The level of funding provided to support the initiative in each year depends on the number and scale of events involved and their estimated benefits in terms of visitor numbers and international media coverage.  As the initiative is administered by Fáilte Ireland, the level of funding provided is a day-to-day matter for the Agency itself.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5893">I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 618 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5894">I have noted the comments made in the correspondence referred to by the Deputies in relation to the challenges facing those in the visual arts sector.  Many of the funding channels referred to in the correspondences fall within the remit of other Departments and local authorities.  In respect of the Per Cent for Arts scheme, work is continuing apace in finalising new guidelines for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5895">Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  It is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the council include the following: to stimulate public interest in the arts; to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; and to assist in improving standards in the arts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5896">The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, and I have no role to play in relation to its funding decisions.  I refer the Deputies to my reply of 28 January 2009 last to question 41832/08.  As I outlined in that reply, under measures introduced in the 2009 budget, all Departments and State agencies are to achieve a range of reductions and savings in 2009, both on pay and non-pay expenditure, and the Arts Council is no exception.  These include a 3% reduction in the level of their 2008 pay bill and at least a 50% reduction in their consultancy and advertising budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_5897">By any standards, however, the Arts Council has seen significant increases in its funding allocation in recent years, increasing by over 59% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €81.62 million in 2009.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers' money in any context and have effectively transformed the arts, by facilitating increased access to and participation in the full spectrum of art forms throughout the country.  The Government's sustained support has resulted in a firm foundation to the arts sector that will assist it in facing future challenges.  This Government is committed to supporting the arts and will continue to fund the Arts Council within available financial resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_6095">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section — http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID — and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_6096">The House will be aware that I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004. Under these schemes, my Department tops up the funds of other Departments and agencies to provide small-scale local projects such as playgrounds, traffic measures, improved health facilities, CCTV, and top-up funds for projects promoted by sporting organisations under the Sports Capital Programme. The lead agency in relation to the projects referred to in the Deputy's question is the HSE. Subject to available resources and completion of the projects by the HSE, my Department will honour the commitments referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_6114">In 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas was nearly €34.8m.  Funding for 2009 will be approx €34.6m, which, in overall terms, is a minor reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6115">However, against the background of current financial difficulties all Drugs Task Forces have been asked to identify savings across their areas of responsibility.

            <p eId="para_6127">I propose to take Questions Nos. 793 and 794 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6128">Defined benefit (DB) pension schemes are required to comply with the funding standard provision set out in the Pensions Act. This funding standard requires DB pension schemes to maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6129">The Government is very conscious of the pressures on employers sponsoring pension schemes, and scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last year. While 81% of DB pension schemes satisfied the funding standard at the end of 2007, it is estimated that in excess of 90% of DB pension schemes are in deficit at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6130">As the Deputy is aware, in recognition of the current market difficulties and the challenges facing pension trustees, the Government recently announced a number of short-term measures aimed at easing the pressures felt by many defined benefit schemes. These included:</p>
            <p eId="para_6131">granting extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals;</p>
            <p eId="para_6132">granting flexibility to the Pensions Board to allow longer periods (over 10 years) for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances;</p>
            <p eId="para_6133">enabling the Board to allow the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan in certain circumstances; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6134">enabling the Board to take into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_6135">I believe that these measures will assist schemes currently in difficulty and will help to ensure the best outcomes for the scheme members themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_6136">In addition, the Government is currently considering a number of options in relation to the ongoing security of occupational pensions. Any decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the National Pensions Framework which will be finalised shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_6140">A retired civil servant or his or her spouse may qualify for a Widows/Widowers Contributory Pension on the death of one of the couple in addition to their occupational pension.  In such case the Widows/Widowers Contributory Pension would be based on the PRSI record of either the claimant or their spouse.  Either the claimant or their spouse must have:</p>
            <p eId="para_6141">at least 156 paid contributions (paid to the date the spouse died or before their 66th birthday, whichever is earlier)  and</p>
            <p eId="para_6142">an average of 39 paid or credited contributions in either the 3 or 5 years before the death of the spouse or before they reached pension age (66)  or</p>
            <p eId="para_6143">a yearly average of at least 24 paid or credited contributions from the year of first entry into insurance until the year of death or reaching pension age. If this average is used then an average of 24 will entitle the spouse to a minimum pension.  An average of 48 per year is required to get the full pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_6144">One of the qualifying conditions for credited calculations is that the person be available for and genuinely seeking work, hence the requirement for them to sign on periodically. If a person were not to sign for credited calculations between age 60 and 66, the yearly average would fall below 48, thereby reducing their spouse's pension. For this reason it is very important that anyone, including a civil servant, who retires before age 66, continues to sign for credits in order to protect their family.</p>
            <p eId="para_6145">In general terms, people availing of credited contributions are required to sign on monthly, but these arrangements are being reviewed by the Department with a view to introducing less frequent signing for this group.</p>

            <p eId="para_6170">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6171">The person concerned is currently in receipt of rent supplement support at the maximum level available to him, based on his current personal circumstances and the area in which he is living. The person concerned has been advised by the Executive that his current circumstances do not warrant an increase in his rent supplement support payment.  He has also been advised of his right of appeal to the Executive's designated Appeals Office, if he is not satisfied with the decision of the community welfare officer.</p>

We have recently implemented a number of initiatives to minimise delays for callers including the introduction of a new telephony system and call management software.

            <p eId="para_6187">The Department supports Government policy which aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.  Our payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise.  Currently some 81% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their post office or financial institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_6188">In February and March 2009 a letter was sent to some 100,000 recipients of Carer's Allowance, Invalidity Pension and Disability Allowance informing them of the change from payment by Personalised Payable Order (PPO) book to payment by means of a social services card at their local post office.</p>
            <p eId="para_6189">In issuing these types of large mailshots, every effort is made by the Department to ensure that letters are not sent out in the name of people who have passed away.

            <p eId="para_6191">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6192">Qualification for payment under this scheme requires that a person must be engaged in insurable employment for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the assessable income of the person(s) raising the children. The combined income of a couple (married or unmarried) is taken into account. Improvements to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income to net income, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and, in recent years, the re- focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</p>
            <p eId="para_6193">An integral feature of the scheme is that, once the level of FIS payments is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6194">Furthermore, Social Welfare Legislation provides that both FIS and Jobseeker's Benefit/Assistance cannot be paid to a person in respect of the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_6195">Changes to the FIS scheme since its introduction have allowed it to remain responsive to changing employment patterns. However the Department is mindful of the recent increase in more varied work pattern arrangements. In the context of FIS, such employment arrangements give rise to a number of legal and administrative issues which are receiving careful and urgent examination by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6202">The administration costs of the schemes are met by the Department.  Funding for salaries of community welfare officers is based on the proportion of time they spend administering these schemes. Funding is provided centrally to the HSE which is responsible for the allocation of budgets to individual community welfare divisions.  In 2008 the Department paid the HSE €58.3m in administration costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6203">The issue of increased demand on existing resources is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise workloads and re-deploy resources where necessary so that frontline services are maintained.  The HSE is currently reviewing the allocation of staff engaged in the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and associated income support payments.   The Department is committed to working closely with the HSE in ensuring effective delivery of services and any request by the HSE for an additional staffing allocation will be given due consideration.  However, the question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided, would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_6224">I propose to take Questions Nos. 816 and 817 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6225">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6226">Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_6227">Section 198(6) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 provides that a person shall not be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement where that person or his or her spouse is engaged in remunerative full-time work.  Article (6)(3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations 2007 (S. I. 412 of 2007) provides "a person shall be regarded as being engaged in remunerative full-time work where he or she is so engaged for not less than 30 hours per week."</p>
            <p eId="para_6228">Hours of work are generally calculated by reference to the contract of employment and/or confirmation from an employer as to the number of hours for which a person is contracted to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6229">Under Section 196(2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, where a person and his/her spouse are members of the same household, "their needs and means shall be aggregated and shall be regarded as the means and needs of the claimant."  In these circumstances, the income of an applicant for mortgage interest supplement and his or her spouse is taken into account when assessing means.  In addition, in calculating the weekly means of a person for entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, including mortgage interest supplement, Rule 4 of Part 4 of Schedule 3 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that account shall be taken of "all income and the value of all property of which the person has directly or indirectly deprived himself or herself in order to qualify himself or herself for the receipt of supplementary welfare allowance."</p>
            <p eId="para_6230">Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case.</p>
            <p eId="para_6231">In view of the current economic environment, the Department has commenced a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_6235">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie.</i>There are now 252 money advice staff employed throughout the country in the MABS.  Money Advisors focus on providing assistance, advice and support to people who have financial difficulties.  They work out a budget suited to the individual or family.</p>
            <p eId="para_6236">They negotiate on behalf of clients with all creditors including banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, utility companies and credit unions to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the Money Advisor can assist with setting up a special account with their local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the Money Advisor makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  The MABS also provide ongoing support to people who successfully overcome their financial difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_6237">The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should take early action. An approach to the MABS, via any of the channels, can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties. The MABS provides a high quality personal service to members of the public that helps many in coping with and overcoming the burden of indebtedness that can have such an impact on their lives and that of their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_6332">In March 2007 the Government published the report of the Expert Group on the Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF).  Following the publication of the Expert Group Report the responsibilities then held by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to the health effects of EMF were transferred to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6333">The Expert Group Report examined a wide range of issues including the potential health effects of extremely low frequency (ELF) fields such as those produced by electrical appliances in the home as well as by high voltage power cables.  The Report and its recommendations have been accepted by the Government. It is available for download on my Department's website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_6334">The Report recommended that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  These guidelines have been endorsed by the World Health Organisation and are recommended by the European Commission to EU Member States.  They are based on a weight of evidence review from all peer-reviewed scientific literature, and provide adequate protection for the public from any EMF sources.  They set exposure limits that are applicable for both public and occupational exposure, regardless of whether the cable is located above or below ground level.  While the guidelines were first published in 1998, they are under continual review, and still have appropriately protective limits.  The guidelines can be downloaded from the ICNIRP website (<i>www.icnirp.org</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_6335">I am advised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that the overhead electricity lines and underground electricity cables developed and operated by EirGrid and the ESB fully comply with the most up-to-date recommendations of ICNIRP in respect of exposure to electric and magnetic fields.</p>

I understand that Westmeath County Council employed a Heritage Officer with Heritage Council support from 2003 to 2007.

However, I understand the Council decided to discontinue its involvement in the programme.</p>

To address these issues I am providing funding of €13 million to implement the recommendations set out in the Market Development Programme for Waste Resources 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6388">The Programme for Government signalled the further development of waste and resource policy in the direction of sustainability and, in particular, to move away from mass burn incineration towards alternative technologies. Arising from a commitment in the Programme, a major international review of waste management strategy is now underway. This will inform the Government's approach to waste prevention and minimisation and to diversion of waste from landfill.</p>
            <p eId="para_6389">My view generally is that undue emphasis on incineration as the cornerstone of waste management policy is detrimental to the development of alternative solutions. The current review of waste policy may well indicate a continuing role for incineration in our future waste management strategy but I do not envisage it being on anything like the scale that was previously envisaged.</p>

            <p eId="para_6399">Section 10(2)(l) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to include objectives for "the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other education and childcare facilities".   This requirement is restated in my Department's Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published in June 2007, and which are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_6400">I announced the publication of The Provision of Schools and the Planning System — A Code of Practice in August 2008, jointly with the Minister for Education and Science, and the Minister of State for Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas.  The Code of Practice, which was agreed between the two Departments, in conjunction with the City and County Managers' Association, sets out the roles, responsibilities and specific actions to be taken in relation to forecasting future demand for school places and planning for schools provision through the development plan, local area plan and development management processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6401">The Code of Practice outlines the principles and scope for integrating schools provision with the development plan process and, in particular, towards linking anticipated levels of demand for school places with housing strategies and the provision of large-scale residential developments, as well as reinforcing effective early between the planning authorities and the Department of Education and Science.  The Code of Practice also highlights the necessity for co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and local authorities on school site identification and acquisition, and that Department is working with the City and County Managers' Association on the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure the timely and efficient acquisition of school sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_6402">The Code of Practice issued as statutory guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and was circulated to all city and county councils at the end of August 2008.

            <p eId="para_6404">Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the original Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6405">Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.  The National Waste Report 2007 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 63.6% in that year, exceeding the target of 60% to be achieved by 2011, set by Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive. The recovery rate for glass packaging in 2007 was 75.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_6406">I fully recognise that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance. The Programme for Government commits us to a comprehensive review of waste management planning, which I initiated in July 2008. This review will ensure that our waste management plans reflect best international practice and that we have the policies and infrastructure to meet ambitious environmental objectives.  The review is also looking at the desirability of other producer responsibility schemes, including deposit and refund for beverage containers.</p>

            <p eId="para_6423">I propose to take Questions Nos. 860 and 875 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6424">Water services investments have been undertaken for a number of years on the basis of a 3-year rolling capital programme of schemes. The schemes included respond to environmental and social-economic developmental needs and priorities identified by local authorities having regard to overall criteria set at national level, and overall national resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6425">The length of time it takes from first proposal of any particular water or sewerage scheme to completion of construction largely depends on the nature and complexity of the scheme and the statutory processes involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_6426">When a water or sewerage scheme is first proposed by a local authority in its Assessment of Needs it may take some time to be approved for inclusion in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, depending critically on the priority afforded to it by the elected members of the local authority and the funding available for the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6427">My Department's involvement at individual stages of schemes in the water services investment programme can vary from two to four occasions depending on the value of the scheme.  My Department approves the local authority's Design Brief and Preliminary Report for all schemes and in some instances it also approves the Contract Documents.  In the case of Public Private Partnership contracts my Department, additionally, approves the local authority's Tender Recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6428">While processes have been streamlined in recent years to allow for greater delegation in relation to smaller schemes to local authorities, the involvement of my Department at key stages is necessary to comply with the Department of Finance's Capital Appraisal Guidelines and my own Department's obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6429">The Department has established systems for the monitoring of progress of projects and targets for dealing with procedural matters.  My Department's objective is to deal with Preliminary Reports within six months of receipt, Contract Documents within four months and Tender Recommendations within two months.  Design Briefs are generally cleared within a few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6430">Local authorities have responsibility for all other aspects of a scheme, including appointment of consultants, statutory planning and other processes (including public consultation and approval of elected members), site investigations, acquisition of lands and wayleaves, preparation of tender documents, tendering process, appointment of contractors and carrying out of works.  The time taken to advance a scheme will depend largely on how quickly these processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6431">The affordability of new sewerage schemes to serve small towns and villages where there is little, if any, existing sewerage infrastructure is a cause of concern.  To bring greater clarity to the issue, specific cost criteria were introduced in 2007 to determine the limit of Departmental funding for new sewerage infrastructure.    Local authorities were also advised to take account of the specific funding parameters for servicing the domestic sector, particularly in relation to the extent and scale of collection systems and the capacity at treatment plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6432">My Department keeps the approval procedures for water services schemes, including the affordability criteria, under ongoing review.</p>

            <p eId="para_6556">Within the last five years, one application for consent to a rate waiver scheme was received by my Department in each of the years 2007 and 2008.  There are two rate waiver schemes that have received Ministerial approval under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 currently in place.   These consents were given in 1988 and 1990 for voluntary and community sporting facilities not licensed for the sale of alcohol.  Such community halls are now not rateable under the Valuation Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_6557">Applications for rate waiver schemes are carefully considered by me and criteria used to evaluate proposals include their impact on competition with existing businesses in the area and the cost to the remaining ratepayers who are required to make up the cost of the rate waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_6687">Work has been ongoing for some time in my Department in drafting measures to provide for statutory regulation of dog breeding establishments within the dog control legislative regime. The issues involved are complex and required detailed consideration. This process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in this area. It is my intention to introduce amending legislation in this area which will address a number of issues.  My proposals in this regard will be published as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6688">The Working Group to review the management of dog breeding establishments recommended that a State regulated registration system for dog breeding establishments be put in place. It defined such establishments as premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential. The Group also called for a comprehensive set of statutorily enforceable standards for the operation of dog breeding establishments with provision for inspections by local authority officers, and that all dogs in such establishments be electronically micro-chipped to ensure traceability and assist the enforcement of the registration system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6689">The group further recommended that the regulatory system be self financing. I am, however, examining the position of non-commercial dog breeding establishments, such as those identified in the Question, in relation to their exemption from registration costs, but consider that the issues of appropriate standards, inspection and traceability must apply to all relevant establishments in the interests of animal welfare.</p>

            <p eId="para_6691">In general, following consideration by the Board, the rates charged to local authority borrowers are normally adjusted by the Board of the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) in line with movements in European Central Bank (ECB) rates. The Agency notified local authorities last month of its decision to pass on, in full, the 0.5% decrease announced by the ECB in January. The effective rate for local authority borrowers from 1 March 2009 is 3% — a cumulative rate decrease since October 2008 of 2.25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_6692">With regard to the most recent announcement of a further 0.5% cut by the ECB on 5 March, the Agency, in responding to any movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds, given that the correlation between ECB rates and inter-bank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) has been atypical and volatile in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_6693">While it is hoped that it will be possible to pass on the most recent rate reduction announced by the ECB, as with previous rate reductions, it will be necessary closely to monitor the impact of the cut on inter-bank rates before a decision can be made. I anticipate that, in common with the situation following the previous cuts which are being passed on in full to local authority borrowers, the position in relation to possible movement in the HFA's lending rates should be clear within a number of weeks.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6699">I propose to take Questions Nos. 894, 897, 898, 902 and 913 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6700">Two key elements of the Government's National Insulation Programme are the Home Energy Saving Scheme and the Warmer Homes Scheme, which are administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  The Home Energy Saving Scheme is scheduled to be opened to applications from householders, shortly.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for attic and wall insulation, efficient boilers, heating controls and BER assessments.  Funding of up to €50 million to the scheme has been provided in 2009.  Grant rates average 30% of the cost of works, although these rates vary depending on the measure concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_6701">SEI advised on the measures for inclusion in the scheme.  SEI has built up a considerable expertise on residential energy efficiency matters and oversaw the pilot phase of the scheme last year.  The selected measures are deemed to be those most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at the least cost.  There are other measures, such as windows and doors, which are not currently included in the scheme.  These may also improve the energy performance of a home but may not be as cost effective for the homeowner.  Once the Scheme is up and running, the Department and SEI will be keeping it under constant review.  If there is a strong cost-benefit case for adding other measures to the scheme, it will be given every consideration, subject to budgetary considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6702">The Home Energy Saving Scheme targets older less energy efficient homes with the aim of bringing them to much higher standards.  By definition, zero energy homes are already at a high energy efficient standard and the measures supported by the Home Energy Saving Scheme are not appropriate to such homes.  There are no plans to introduce any energy efficiency incentives for existing zero energy homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6703">The second element of the Programme, the Warmer Homes Scheme, is designed to assist private households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit.  The Scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  The scheme provides these measures free or at a nominal cost to the householder.</p>
            <p eId="para_6704">Some €20 million has been made available to the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2009 including €10 million provided between ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann.  This greatly increased level of funding is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in this year alone.  Further information on the Warmer Homes Scheme is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at:</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_6707">Grant support is available from Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) for domestic and commercial geothermal heat pump applications through the "Greener Homes" scheme and the "REHeat" scheme respectively.  These programmes have had significant numbers of applicants since their launch.  Geothermal heating systems are highly effective heating systems and ideally suited to Ireland.  Using one unit of electricity, they can provide up to 4 units of renewable energy heat.  Geothermal heat pumps are largely charged at night time.  It is considered that this could offer significant benefits in terms of absorbing electricity generated from our significant wind and wave energy resources which otherwise might not be required during the low night time demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_6708">Deep geothermal energy is another area gathering interest in Ireland.  In this process deep wells of up to 2,000m in depth are drilled in order to recover warm water from the rocks below.  At present this technology is untried in Ireland but researchers are actively pursuing it.  Research support is available from SEI and  funding has also been made available to third-level centres of excellence by the Geological Survey of Ireland through the Griffith Awards. Funding under these awards has previously been made available to the Geophysics Research Groups at University College Dublin and University of Ulster at Coleraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_6709">Given the high costs and risks associated with drilling a deep bore hole as required for this technology, the Working Group on Geothermal Energy established by the Department in May 2008 is examining the regulatory and legal framework associated with large developments of this kind in order to ensure that developers are provided with the most effective path and instruction for their developments.  It is anticipated that investors will be enabled to make their decisions with greater confidence as a result of increased regulatory and planning clarity for this new technology.</p>

The Deputy also sought details in relation to the amount of excise relief granted in respect of imported biofuels in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6756">I propose to take Questions Nos. 906 and 907 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6757">The East-West Interconnector is a 500MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  The total length of the interconnector from the Irish connection point at Woodland, County Meath, to the UK connection point at Deeside in Wales, is approximately 260 km, of which 185km is under the Irish Sea.  I am advised that EirGrid expects the contract for design and construction of the interconnector to be completed shortly, when the successful bidder will be announced.  Financing options for this project are being pursued by EirGrid with the objective of achieving the most cost-effective and efficient financial package.  Until the tendering and finance process is complete, it would not be appropriate to specify the estimated cost of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_6758">The European Commission has included the East-West Interconnector on the list of energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Package, which was endorsed by the European Council last week. The European Council called on the Presidency to accelerate contacts with the European Parliament with a view to reaching agreement on the package before the parliamentary recess.  Any funding available under this package will be used to offset the total capital cost of the interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6759">The interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned and operated by EirGrid.  State ownership of this strategic energy infrastructure will ensure that costs are minimised and benefits are passed along to consumers.  EirGrid will run the interconnector on an open access basis.  Under EC Regulation 1228/2003, which sets out rules for cross-border transactions within the electricity sector, users of the interconnector will be charged for utilising interconnector capacity when demand is greater than availability.  At other times, EirGrid will recover the cost of the interconnector through transmission charges.  However, EirGrid estimates that the benefits provided by the interconnector in terms of enabling greater competition and facilitating greater wind penetration will more than offset the costs of the interconnector and deliver a net benefit to consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_6795">The Gas Act, 1976, as amended, provides for the conduct of an oral hearing where an objection is received to an application to the Minister for a compulsory acquisition order pursuant to section 32 of the Gas Act, for land required in connection with the construction of a natural gas pipeline.  This provision was transferred to An Bórd Pleanála under Section 37 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006. An application for planning permission in respect of the Corrib Gas Pipeline has been made to An Bórd Pleanála, which is now the appropriate authority under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006 and I understand that an oral hearing is to be held by the Bórd.</p>
            <p eId="para_6796">My Department has also received an application for the construction of the Corrib Gas pipeline pursuant to section 40 of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended. In considering that application I required the developer, as part of the statutory Environmental Impact Assessment process, to consult publicly on the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted in support of the application.  This process concluded on 9 March, 2009 and the submissions received are being considered as part of the overall EIS assessment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6797">In relation to the benefits to the economy that will arise from the gas coming on stream, it is estimated the Corrib Gas Field will meet over 50% of our national gas demand during peak production with substantial tax revenue accruing to the Exchequer resulting from profits from the field.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_6802">I propose to take Questions Nos. 919 and 926 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6803">Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation requires the Irish authorities to prepare a national Eel Management Plan for implementation from 1 July 2009 or from the earliest possible time before that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_6804">The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that the objective of each Member State's Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.  Ireland's level of escapement is currently estimated at only 24%.  When the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, I am advised that it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_6805">The Irish eel fishery harvests approximately 100 tonnes per annum and I understand that there are up to 150 fishermen who hold a maximum of 296 licences, not all of which are actively fished.  There is some evidence that catches have been declining over recent years because of the status of stocks and elver recruitment is very low.  Eel fishing is not a full time occupation and it is restricted, depending on the type of fish being targeted, to certain months of the year and times of the lunar cycle in the case of migrating silver eels.</p>
            <p eId="para_6806">The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken, based on the best management and scientific advice available (the nature of which I have elaborated on in replies to recent Parliamentary Questions), as a conservation measure to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible, which if all measures proposed are adopted and if the EU Member States adopt a similar conservative approach, could be as long as 90 years (i.e. an average of 4 eel generations).  A partial closure of the fishery or a more relaxed approach to the other management measures would have extended this recovery period to a very significant extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_6807">I am not aware of the content of the plans, as yet largely unpublished, submitted by other Member States in response to their obligations under the EC Regulation.  Over the coming months, these, along with Ireland's draft plan, have to be evaluated by the European Commission as to their adequacy in delivering the objectives of the Eel Regulation.  Clearly the status of stocks in other Member States will differ from that of Ireland's depending on local conditions and therefore their plans may make different recommendations.  All must, however, clearly demonstrate how they would achieve the targets necessary for recovery of the European eel stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6808">Under the Regulation, all aspects of the Plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  The national plan submitted to the EU includes a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of management actions and their implementation.  It also includes a programme of scientific eel stock assessment to establish a stock baseline, estimate current silver eel escapement and monitoring the impact of the management actions on the local stocks.  The Department has committed funding to stock assessment for the 2009 programme, which will be a collaborative effort between the relevant State agencies and include appropriate stakeholders participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6809">Insofar as previous stakeholder involvement is concerned, once the EU guidance on the Regulation was available, a fact sheet prepared by the working group established to prepare Ireland's National Eel Management Plan was circulated to all interested parties by the Regional Fisheries Boards in March 2008.  The elected eel representatives on the Regional Fisheries Boards were kept informed by the fisheries boards' officials on progress towards preparation of the eel management plan.  A number of conservation measures were introduced by way of bye-laws in May 2008.   A public consultation exercise was undertaken on the draft Eel Management Plans from 1 August 2008.  Information meetings were organised in each region by the Regional Fisheries Boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6810">The consultation period ended on 15 September 2008 and some 16 submissions were received.  These were largely from eel fishermen representatives and, while acknowledging the decline in stocks, sought to continue fishing regardless.  Three eel fishing representatives joined the Working Group in October 2008.  I met with eel fishermen's representatives prior to and since the submission of the national plan to the EU Commission and have assured them of the prospects for their future participation in aspects of its implementation and review of the performance of the fishery.</p>

            <p eId="para_6812">The initiation of a pilot trial by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) of micro and small-scale generation technologies is designed to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the deployment of micro-generation technologies including installation, network connection and operation, and generation.  Grant aid for up to 50 pilot installations, will be provided as part of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6813">Among the measures is a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.  This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next three years.  Access to the feed-in tariff will also include the provision of a smart-meter to facilitate exports to the grid and encourage those customers to examine their electricity use generally. Eligible installations include small scale wind, photovoltaic, hydro and combined heat and power.  The experience gained in the performance of this programme will inform the roll-out of a subsequent wider micro-scale programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6814">Traditionally, the electricity network was designed to accommodate the flow of electricity from large centralised plants to customers dispersed throughout the country.  Micro-generation at local level now introduces two-way flows to the electricity system.  Local generators will have the ability to be paid by the ESB for electricity that is surplus to their own requirements and export it back to the national grid.</p>
            <p eId="para_6815">A call for expression of interest is currently open for the Low Carbon Housing Programme administered by SEI.  In addition to having a minimum requirement of a Building Energy Rating of A2 or higher the targets also include provision for onsite generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6816">The Revised Building Regulations brought into force in July 2008 now include a compulsory renewable energy component for all new houses.  This will not only ensure that renewables are integrated into the housing stock but will also encourage individuals to consider a range of renewable options when purchasing a new home.  This is further underpinned by the introduction of the Building Energy Rating which provides information to house purchasers on energy performance and to which renewables energy systems will contribute.</p>
            <p eId="para_6817">The Greener Homes Scheme, administered by SEI, provides grant support to individuals wishing to install renewable energy heating technologies in their homes.  This scheme, in operation since early 2006, has already established a very strong supply industry for renewable energy products, services and fuels while the application of strict product standards and installer training and quality schemes has ensured that consumers are informed in relation to their choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_6818">The Renewable Heat (ReHeat) and CHP Programmes, also provide assistance for the deployment of renewable heating systems in industrial, commercial, public and community premises.</p>

            <p eId="para_6864">Following on from the 2009 Budget Day announcement on 14th October 2008 of the overall rationalisation of State agencies, the Government has now formally approved proposals for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector, which include the creation of a single strengthened national inland fisheries authority to be known as Inland Fisheries Ireland. This authority will replace the existing Central and seven regional fisheries boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6865">Given the nature of inland fisheries, it is clear that the new authority should be organised with a strong regional presence, which will be aligned on the boundaries of the River Basin Districts. There are 6 River Basin Districts with one district for the area covered by the existing Western and North Western Regional Fisheries Boards. Accordingly, alignment with the River Basin Districts will require that the area is administered and reported on as one entity.</p>
            <p eId="para_6866">This is settled Government policy and the Department is working towards its implementation. However, the question of the retention of offices in both Galway and Ballina is to be considered further as the legislation providing for the new structures is progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6868">The issue of imprisonment of persons who have failed to pay a court imposed fine is a matter that will fall to be addressed in the first instance by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the forthcoming Fines Bill.  However, I have introduced two new provisions in the Broadcasting Bill 2008, which I anticipate will reduce the necessity for criminal proceedings in respect of the payment of the television licence fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_6869">The first provision in section 149 of the Bill proposes an on-the-spot fine mechanism to be deployed at the option of the television licence collection agent. In essence this mechanism provides that if a person buys a television licence within a set time period and pays a penalty equivalent to one third of the annual television licence fee then no court proceedings will be taken, thus reducing the necessity for court proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6870">The second provision which is proposed in section 150(3) empowers the television licence collection agent to pursue as a civil debt an amount owing in respect of a television licence fee.</p>

            <p eId="para_6872">I am aware of the process for collection of television licence fees in other countries, including Greece to which the Deputy refers. In that country, as well as in some other European countries, the licence fee is a levy calculated as a percentage of the electricity bill which is then added to the bill. While such a system may have an advantage in terms of a reduction in collection costs and possibly evasion rates, I am of the opinion that there are a number of disadvantages to this model, including the linking of the funding of public service broadcasting output to electricity consumption.  Our model does share an element in common to these other systems, however, in that it does allow for the payment of the licence fee on an instalment basis.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_6965">The deal I secured in the Health Check of the CAP negotiations last November is worth a potential €80 million in additional payments to farmers over the coming years.  In addition, the increase in milk quota will deliver some €100 million worth of additional milk production by 2014.  This is enormously positive for the sector and, while there are also elements in the package that I do not like, such as increased modulation, I am satisfied that this will not lead to any loss to Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6966">The main aspects of the deal that are of interest to Ireland are as follows: Milk quotas will be increased by 1% per annum for each of the next five years (2009-2013).  In addition an adjustment in the butterfat reference will mean the equivalent of an extra 2% in milk quota for Ireland in 2009.  Two reviews of the market situation are planned, by December 2010 and by December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6967">Due to our additional production potential, Ireland will benefit greatly from these changes.  Including the 2% quota increase already in place for 2008, this means that an additional 500 million litres of milk will be produced in Ireland when these changes come into effect.  This was an outstanding achievement given the alignment of forces on the Council.  I am particularly pleased that our farmers and processors now have policy clarity and can plan their investments with a greater degree of certainty about the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6968">As regards market support schemes, in essence, the key market management mechanisms that are most important to Ireland have been left completely unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_6969">I also was successful in obtaining the option of using funds from the National Reserve together with unused monies from the Single Payment funds allocated annually to Ireland to target at specific vulnerable sectors.  There is approximately €7 million available in the National Reserve and I secured agreement to use these funds with effect from 2009.  Under the final agreement, we will also have access to additional funds of the order of €25 million annually from unspent funds from 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6970">The funds can be used to address specific economic disadvantages affecting farmers in the dairy, beef and veal, sheep and goat and rice sectors.  I persuaded the Commission to expand the scope of these measures to include economically vulnerable sectors irrespective of their geographical location.  Yesterday I announced details of my decision to allocate the €7million becoming available this year to the sheep sector, specifically in the form of an Uplands sheep payment to be paid this year to eligible farmers.  Once the Commission detailed rules become available on the requirements for 2010 onwards I will be making further announcements as regards the unused CAP funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_6971">Simplification is another area where I am pleased with the progress achieved and the commitment secured from the Commission and the Council as regards further simplification.  The details of the simplification measures resulting from the Health Check have been well documented and I will continue to press for even further reduction of the administrative burden for farmers and administrations alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_6972">As to modulation, the rate has been increased by 5%.  I would have preferred if no additional modulation was agreed.  However, this was one element of the negotiations on which Commissioner Fischer Boel was particularly determined.  I am satisfied that we succeeded in getting the rate of additional modulation considerably reduced from the original proposals.  It is worth noting that over 50,000 Irish farmers will be exempt from this increase.  I can confirm that there will be a budget neutral effect in respect of the 70,000 farmers affected by the change as I have ensured that all the funds raised can be passed straight back to Irish farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_6974">At the Councilof Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels on 29 September 2008, the issue of Climate Change was included in the agenda at my request.  I voiced my concerns about the challenge posed by the EU's Climate Change proposals for agriculture and the food sector in Ireland and throughout the E U.  I reminded my colleagues of the vital role of EU agriculture in underpinning food security both within the Union and globally.  Within the Council it was clear that Agriculture Ministers recognised the importance of ensuring that the EU's policy objectives for the agriculture and food sectors were upheld in the context of Climate Change negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6975">As I indicated at the Council of Ministers meeting, I am firmly of the view that reducing Ireland's agricultural production in order to meet greenhouse gas targets will not reduce global emissions.  Ireland's pasture based agricultural production systems are very efficient in terms of the ratio of greenhouse gas per unit of food produced.  Any fall in Irish beef and dairy output would probably be replaced, on the European and global markets, by food from countries where production systems are far less sustainable and where the carbon footprint of that food is significantly higher than that of food produced in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6976">World demand for food is growing with the possibility of a doubling of meat and dairy consumption, globally, by 2050.  I am committed to ensuring that our agriculture and food sectors are in a position to respond to these opportunities, both in the interest of global food security and any market opportunities that may arise.  I am conscious of the importance of underpinning food security and ensuring our agricultural sector is sustainable and resilient against the background of emerging global challenges such as Climate Change.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_6986">My plans for the development of the beef sector can be summarised as follows: advanced processing methods and product development; sophisticated and targeted marketing; efficient farm production with quality assurance; and better scientifically based animal breeding.</p>
            <p eId="para_6987">Ireland produces over 0.5 million tonnes of beef annually, over 90% of which is exported.  More than 50% of these exports go to the UK with a further 45% going to high-value Continental EU markets.  This outcome has been achieved by the delivery of a high quality, competitively priced product together with effective marketing and promotion by both Bord Bia and the industry.  The value of Irish beef exports in 2008 was almost €1.69 billion, an increase of over 7% on the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6988">The immediate prospects for Irish beef exports remain positive. A continuing supply deficit in the EU market is predicted, as production will only account for 90% to 95% of consumption.  This shortfall offers Irish beef producers an opportunity to further consolidate their position in this market.  Potential importers such as Brazil and Argentina are limited in what they can do because of either health or export restrictions.  However, the impact of exchange rate developments will be important, particularly in relation to the UK and, given the economic recession, a continuing switch to lower value cuts in key markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_6989">One consequence of the shift towards the internal EU market over recent years has been a decline in amounts available for export to international markets. Nevertheless, third country markets continue to provide an important alternative outlet for Irish beef and I will continue my efforts to ensure that as many of these markets as possible are open to our exports.  The re-opening of markets in Saudi Arabia and South Africa in 2007 and, more recently, in the Philippines and Israel demonstrates that our BSE controls are working effectively.  Work on opening other markets is continuing and a Market Access Group supports our efforts in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_6990">Notwithstanding these favourable factors, we cannot afford to be complacent. The development of non-price strategies is fundamental to meeting evolving market challenges.  Consequently, and in line with the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan, a number of policy initiatives have been developed and enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_6991">Amongst these are the Animal Welfare Scheme for Suckler Herds and the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme.  The Animal Welfare Scheme collects genetic data from suckler farms around Ireland for analysis by ICBF.  This will expedite the genetic improvement of, and add significant value to, the national beef herd by allowing farmers to select the most profitable breeding animals for their farms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6992">The Beef Quality Assurance Scheme, which is administered by Bord Bia, plays a vital role in reassuring consumers that they are purchasing a safe, quality product, fully traceable across the production system from ‘farm to fork'.</p>
            <p eId="para_6993">Funding is also continuing for the beef breed improvement programmes being progressed by ICBF with major advances expected through the use of sophisticated science and technology in this field.</p>
            <p eId="para_6994">With a view to developing markets, Bord Bia is implementing a marketing strategy for Irish beef for the period 2008 to 2013 based on the overriding principles of differentiating and re-positioning Irish beef.  This strategy is focused on the key characteristics of Irish beef — traditional grass based production, full traceability and quality assurance — and the targeting of high-value niche markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_6995">Finally, I should mention the continuing work of the Beef Forum.  This was established to identify the opportunities and challenges facing the beef sector, thus allowing a framework for future development to be set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_6996">I believe that all these measures, combined with our high level of food safety standards, will best position the Irish beef sector to maintain and improve its competitiveness in EU and international markets.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_6998">I believe that the report of the Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group provides a proper framework for the future development of the sheep sector. While most of the group's recommendations are to be implemented by the industry itself, a number of them fall within the remit of my Department and the state agencies under my aegis. The current position regarding the implementation of these recommendations is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_6999">A new company called ‘Sheep Ireland' which will take over the Department's current breed improvement programme has been established to develop a new programme.  An interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders has been established to oversee this process, with the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation (ICBF) providing the technical and professional service required.</p>
            <p eId="para_7000">My Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep. Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to €1000 in addition to his or her basis REPS payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7001">A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcase classification for lamb was conducted last year.  The results of this trial are being analysed.  It is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcases and will gain universal industry support.  This would aid greatly in price transparency, which is a prerequisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_7002">The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007.  This Scheme which is operated by Bord Bia, now has 7000 participants and it is hoped to increase the participation rate during the current year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7003">The number of new potential markets for Irish lamb is limited due to the relatively high cost of the meat and to cultural factors, as lamb is not widely eaten in many countries of Eastern Europe.  As a result, Bord Bia has intensified its efforts to promote lamb on home and export markets.  Together with its UK and French counterparts it is part of a generic promotion campaign on the important French market.</p>
            <p eId="para_7004">Teagasc have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which include hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity to develop a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and to identify research and development needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7005">The actions being taken by my Department and the state agencies under its aegis complement those being taken by the Industry.  I am satisfied that taken together, all of these actions will be of significant benefit to the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_7006">Approximately 70% of Irish sheepmeat production is exported, mainly to the high-value EU market.  Traditionally, France has been the major export market for Irish lamb and in 2008 it accounted for more than 50% of Irish sheepmeat exports.  The French market, however, has been in decline due to a fall in consumption there.  Irish sheepmeat is facing strong competition in France from the UK due to a weakened sterling and from New Zealand, which continues to build up its presence of chilled lamb on the EU market.  While Irish exports to France have declined, the impact has been lessened by increased exports to other markets.  Exports to Sweden and Denmark have increased significantly in recent years.  The issues facing the sheep sector are not unique to Ireland and I have ensured that they have been kept to the forefront at EU meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_7007">Following on from the recent CAP Health Check, I received a number of submissions regarding possible future support for this sector.  One of my primary objectives in the Health Check Negotiations was to obtain access to unspent funds within the EU's agriculture budget for use by Member States with a wide range of discretion.  This was achieved in the final deal and, as a result, Ireland will receive additional funds amounting to approximately €7 million in 2009 (from the National Reserve) and €29 million in subsequent years, to fund measures that are targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7008">I announced yesterday my decision to use the €7 million available this year on a new Uplands Sheep Payment.  In reaching my decision, I recognised the difficulties and costs, including compliance costs, facing this sector.  I also wanted to ensure that this aid would not create any additional administrative burden for hill sheep farmers.  Subject to Commission approval, payments will commence on 1 December 2009, the first date that payments can commence under the EU Regulations.  Based on the estimated National Reserve funds for 2009 and the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from this payment.  The aid will be payable on mountain type grazing land up to a maximum of 15 hectares and based on the data available for 2008, it is estimated that the level of aid will be €35 per hectare and a maximum payment per farmer of €525.  This measure is solely for 2009.  A decision on the use of the unspent CAP funds and modulation monies from 2010 onwards, will be made when further information is available on the detailed rules that will apply to these measures.  The EU Commission will shortly table its proposals for the detailed rules for the use of the unused funds and it is expected that they will be finalised in May/June of this year.  It is important that these funds will be used efficiently for the development of Irish agriculture.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_7010">The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.  The aim of the draft Regulations is to modernise and improve EU food labelling rules, so that consumers have, in a legible and understandable manner, the essential information they need to make informed purchasing choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_7011">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling.  However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7012">We will continue to pursue the issue of origin labelling at EU level in the context of the current review.  It should be noted that products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_7013">The Commission adopted a Green paper on Agricultural Product Quality in October last as part of a drive to protect EU quality agricultural products against ‘low cost products from overseas'.  One of the questions posed was whether a logo identifying European Union versus non European Union origin in terms of quality and environmental standards particular to the EU would be a useful mechanism.  A High Level Conference organised by Czech Presidency to supplement the Green Paper consultation held earlier this month, concluded that further consideration was needed on the possibility of EU/Non EU labelling.  The Commission will now proceed to draft a policy options paper (a "Communication") in May 2009 based on the outcome of the conference and the 500+ submissions received on the green paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_7015">Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that Member States must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including poultry meat and poultry meat products, as well as to imports of these products from third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_7016">Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the Member States to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health.  The application of these standards in the Member States is monitored by the FVO (Food &amp; Veterinary Office) of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_7017">It is a requirement that animal products imported from 3rd countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States.  All such imports must come from 3rd countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_7018">The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved.  Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list.  If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</p>
            <p eId="para_7019">Import controls form a part of the EU's integrated policy of guaranteeing that the food produced and placed on to the market is safe and that animal and public health is not put at risk.

            <p eId="para_7021">In general, responsibility for control and enforcement at retail level of labelling of meat and meat products rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).</p>
            <p eId="para_7022">My Department is responsible for the operation of EU controls on imports of products of animal origin under the service contract with the FSAI and in compliance with Community rules for the hygiene of food and feed. These rules stipulate that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_7023">In the case of importation from third countries products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment be appropriately labelled and transported and be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation. The Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) monitors and audits animal and public health controls applied in approved third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_7024">Consignments from third countries must be landed at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) approved by FVO for veterinary checks. My Department undertakes its import control in co-operation with Customs services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7025">The scope of products of animal origin coming under these requirements are set out under Commission Decision No. 2007/275/EC11 Official Journal of the European Communities No. L116 of 4.5.2007 which also provides for an exemption from border inspection in the case of certain composite and specified food products comprising processed low risk animal products and plant products. Such food products must nevertheless comply with public health requirements for placing on the market.  Consignments of animal products must remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_7026">Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7027">Where there are risks to animal and public health, and in cases of animal disease outbreaks, the Community introduces safeguard measures banning or restricting imports until the risks have been removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7028">The FVO monitors and inspects each Member State controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</p>

            <p eId="para_7030">The average annual yield of the cereals in Ireland is of the order of 2m tonnes, over eighty percent of which is used for animal feed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7031">Ireland has, on average, an annual shortfall of about 550k tonnes of cereals per annum for use as animal feed.  This shortfall is met by imports, mainly from continental Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_7032">In 2007, due to adverse weather conditions, there was a significant decline in cereal output in Ireland and across the EU generally.  Following requests by a number of Member States, including Ireland, the EU Commission put in place measures to address this problem by temporarily suspending import duties for certain cereal crops and relaxing setaside rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_7033">Cereal output increased significantly in Ireland in 2008 to an estimated 2.4 million tonnes, a 21% increase on the 2007 harvest and the second highest on record.</p>
            <p eId="para_7034">The EU is normally self sufficient in cereals and traditionally has been a net exporter of grain. However, due to the bad Community harvest in 2007, the EU became a net importer to the value of 8.4 million tonnes during the 2007/2008 marketing year. To date, in the 2008/2009 marketing year, the EU has returned to being a net exporter, to the value of 13.7 million tonnes of grain.</p>

            <p eId="para_7118">The Hardship Grant Scheme, which runs from 1 November to 30 April, is designed to alleviate the additional feed costs incurred by some owner/keepers whose holdings are restricted during this period on foot of a full herd re-test. The terms and conditions of the scheme provide that the onus is on potentially eligible owner/keepers to apply for the grant and that payment is determined from the date of receipt of the completed application form ER97 in the District Veterinary Office. Application forms are automatically generated by the AHCS computer system in respect of all herds restricted during the eligibility period and issue to all potentially eligible herdowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_7119">In this case, the forms in question were issued by the District Veterinary Office to the person concerned on 23 October 2008. The herdowner contacted the DVO regarding payment but was advised that there is no record of receipt of an application in this case and the person concerned could not provide proof of postage. The herdowner subsequently submitted an application under the scheme on 10 March 2009. Payment under this scheme is made monthly in arrears and, if the herdowner fulfils all of the conditions of the scheme, payment will be made in April 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_7164">Under the Scheme I announced yesterday and based on the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the new payment this year.  On the basis of data available for 2008, I estimate that the level of aid will be of the order of €35 per hectare with a maximum payment of €525 per farmer.  Payments will commence on 1 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7165">In introducing this payment my main objective was to address the difficulties and specific costs, including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector.  In reaching my decision I was mindful of the need to ensure that it created no additional burden for farmers and was simple and low cost to administer.</p>
            <p eId="para_7166">This payment, for which I sought and secured the agreement of the Commission, is for 2009 alone.  I will make a decision on the use of unspent CAP funds from 2010 onwards when further information is available on the detailed EU rules that will apply.  I understand that the Commission will bring forward its proposals in this regard very shortly and they will be adopted in May/June of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7185">We are facing an unprecedented situation in the dairy sector at present and the outlook for dairy markets in the short term is poor.  Following historically high prices in 2007 and early 2008 a market correction is now taking place and there is a further complication of the credit crunch.  These two factors have put an enormous burden on the sector and resulted in a slump in demand.  In Ireland we are entering a period of peak dairy supplies and the levels at which export refunds and intervention function will be critical to the speed at which we emerge from the current difficulties.  I have been urging a short sharp utilisation of the market management measures to get the market back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_7186">I have maintained close contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel regarding the need for appropriate action to support the market.  The Commission responded initially with the early introduction of Private Storage Aid for butter and with the reintroduction of export refunds in January.  In addition the Commissioner gave a commitment to continue intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder under the tendering arrangements once the fixed limits were reached.  These were welcome developments and well judged at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7187">I met the Commissioner in Brussels on the 11th of March to discuss developments and explore the options open to us.  In particular I had two main issues to press her on.  The first was the need to buy butter into intervention at prices close to the fixed price level.  The second was to stress the need to export larger quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder to international markets.  I am pleased to report very positive progress on both these key points.  At last week's management committee meeting it was agreed to purchase a total of 6,665 tonnes of butter into intervention at levels very close to the intervention price.  This is a very important development.  In addition to this, increased quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder were granted export refunds at the same meeting.  In fact, the volumes supported with export refunds last week were almost equivalent to the combined totals of the three previous tenders.  This is a very welcome improvement and should help bring stability to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_7188">I am encouraged by this progress in the use of EU support measures and I believe we have made some positive steps towards stabilising the market.  However, there is still room for improvement and the Commission's role in managing the market is crucial.  I will continue to monitor developments and intervene with the Commissioner when necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_7198">A review of the Millennium Partnership Fund was commissioned by the Higher Education Authority in 2005.  The review concluded that while the fund has served an important function in supporting students from disadvantaged areas to attend further and higher education, it has significant potential to facilitate outreach and role modelling if further developed within a holistic strategy to combat educational disadvantage.  The review recommended a more targeted approach, focusing the fund on a rigorously selected sample of groups with a strategic focus and good linkages with other stakeholders at community level.

The range of recommendations made by the OECD fall under a number of broad headings and significant progress has been made on each front as summarised below. Strategic Management of the Sector</p>
            <p eId="para_7208">The Institutes of Technology Act, which came into effect in February 2007, provided for the creation of a unified management structure for higher education in Ireland by bringing the Institute of Technology sector under the remit of the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  The legislation also extends significant new managerial and academic autonomy to the Institutes, aimed at facilitating further development of their roles.  The budgets of individual Institutes are now set by the HEA and the Department's specific approval to run individual courses or programmes is no longer required.</p>
            <p eId="para_7209">The Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), which was launched in 2006, supports the reform and modernisation agenda that is being pursued at both a national and a European level.  The Irish higher education system aims to build world class quality and capacity and the SIF allows institutions to draw on their considerable respective strengths and form strong partnerships across sectoral and other barriers.  €144 million has been awarded to date under this Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_7210">As announced in the budget last October, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council are to be amalgamated into a single agency.  The new agency will also take responsibility for the external quality assurance function for the Universities currently performed by the Irish Universities Quality Board and the Higher Education Authority.  In seeking to ensure a coherent approach to qualifications and quality assurance, there will also be discussions with the National University of Ireland (NUI) around the possibility of including some of the related functions of the NUI in the new organisation. Access and Retention</p>
            <p eId="para_7211">The latest National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-2013, which I launched in July of last year, sets the following targets for participation in higher education:</p>
            <p eId="para_7212">all socio-economic groups will have entry rates of at least 54% by 2020</p>
            <p eId="para_7213">mature students will comprise at least 20% of full-time entrants by 2013</p>
            <p eId="para_7214">the number of students with sensory, physical and multiple disabilities in higher education will be doubled by 2013</p>
            <p eId="para_7215">The plan also emphasises support for a range of diverse routes to higher education including access courses, the Higher Education Access Route, the supplementary admissions route for students with a disability and to support the NQAI and HETAC in the development of a national plan for the recognition of prior learning.  Additionally, funding has been made available through the Strategic Innovation Fund to support these initiatives. Research</p>
            <p eId="para_7216">The Government is committed to developing Ireland's research and innovation capacity and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation which was launched in 2006 provides the roadmap for action.  The Government reiterated its commitment to implementing the SSTI in its Framework for Economic Renewal published in December 2008 and significant funding continues to be provided in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7217">The SSTI seeks to significantly increase the research capacity, quality and output of the Irish higher education research system by:</p>
            <p eId="para_7218">improving the research skills and capacity of third-level institutions;</p>
            <p eId="para_7219">raising the quality of teaching and learning activities in the institutions;</p>
            <p eId="para_7220">increasing the availability of highly skilled researchers in the labour force;</p>
            <p eId="para_7221">providing greater scope for collaboration between education and other sectors of the economy in respect of research.</p>
            <p eId="para_7222">The SSTI has set two overarching and interlinked goals for developing the research system — to build a sustainable system of world class research teams across all disciplines and to double our output of PhDs.  Implementation structures have also been established for the SSTI — these comprise an Interdepartmental Committee which has responsibility for driving and monitoring the implementation of the strategy and reports to the Cabinet Sub Committee on Science Technology and Innovation.  There are also two distinct but interrelated groups, the Higher Education Research Group and Technology Ireland.  Both groups report back via their Chairs to the InterDepartmental Committee on the Science Technology and Innovation to ensure maximum coherence.</p>
            <p eId="para_7223">Investment in Higher Education</p>
            <p eId="para_7224">The Government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education with substantial improvements in the funding to the sector in recent years.  Overall provision to the third level sector (capital, recurrent, student grants etc) amounted to some €1.5 billion in 2004, some €1.9 billion in 2007 and some €2 billion in 2008.  This is an increase of over 33% since 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_7225">There has been an increase of some 26% in the provision for the university and institute of technology sectors as the recurrent grant has been increased from some €1.1 billion in 2004 to some €1.39 billion in 2008.  This excludes separately provided programmes of funding for capital, for research and development and from the Strategic Innovation Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_7226">In 2006, the HEA commenced the phasing-in of a revised recurrent funding mechanism using a formulaic approach.  This is an output-based model and contains provision for a greater proportion of funding to be allocated to institutions on the basis of performance and the achievement of national outcomes.  Clarity, transparency and fairness as to how the institutions are funded are key objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_7227">The phasing in of the first element of this new funding model commenced in the University Sector in 2006 (10% of funding allocated under the new model).  This increased to 55% in 2007 and was implemented completely for 2008 funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_7228">Work has commenced on a similar funding model for the Institute of Technology sector with discussions at an advanced stage between the Higher Education Authority and the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_7229">Fees</p>
            <p eId="para_7230">In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the higher education sector.  It is appropriate to raise questions around how future additional resource needs can be met and how our higher education institutions can be supported in their development ambitions through a widening of their non-exchequer sources of income.  As the Deputy will be aware I am currently finalising a review of policy options relating to the introduction of a form of student contribution.  It is my intention, following completion of the review currently under way, to bring proposals to Government in the near future in relation to the available options.</p>
            <p eId="para_7231">International Dimension</p>
            <p eId="para_7232">Since the OECD report in 2004, the number of international students recorded in Irish higher education institutions has risen by 45% to a figure of 27,275 in 2007.  The Government is committed to the further internationalisation of the Irish higher education system and I will shortly be bringing forward proposals to introduce new regulatory and marketing co-ordination arrangements that will enhance the promotion of Irish education overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7233">National Strategy for Higher Education</p>
            <p eId="para_7234">Building on the reform agenda that has been under way since the publication of the OECD report 5 years ago and in recognition of the critical role that the higher education system plays in generating the skills, knowledge and innovation on which Ireland's future competitive advantage depends, it is timely to develop a new national higher education strategy which will provide a roadmap for the future development of the sector.  The process to develop a new strategy was launched in early February.  It will examine how well Ireland's higher education system is performing, how it ranks internationally, how well existing resources are being used and how the system can be re-configured to meet challenges.  The strategy will work in tandem with existing strategies already developed by Government which affect the sector, such as the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Skills Strategy.  The process is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  It is being led by a high level steering group which draws on national and international expertise and includes representatives from business, community and student interests, as well as senior Government officials.  Membership of the group, together with the Terms of Reference for the Strategy, are listed below</p>
            <p eId="para_7235">Steering Group Membership</p>

            <p eId="para_7264">The post primary school to which the Deputy refers was among a number of schools that was judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7265">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The post primary school in question appealed its non-inclusion in DEIS but their appeal was unsuccessful.</p>
            <p eId="para_7266">Following the introduction of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non-DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, including the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) service, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_7289">In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, I wish to advise the House in the  first instance that the matter is being handled by the State Claims Agency on  behalf of the State.  Judgement has been reserved on the issue of costs which  was heard on Monday 23rd February.  From the State's perspective, it was  necessary to have such a hearing as the person in question was seeking her  costs against the State.  The State had to make a case for its costs given that  the State was found not liable by either the High Court or the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_7290">I do not wish to pre-empt the pending judgement on the issue of costs, which is  entirely a matter for the Courts to decide.  I can however tell you that  Counsel for the State told the Supreme Court that, while an award of costs  against the Plaintiff was being sought, the matter of enforcement would be  treated with great sensitivity.  Our desire is to strike a fair balance — on  the one hand to treat this person in a humane manner and, on the other, the  need to protect the taxpayer against costs incurred in defending cases where  the Courts have decided that the State has no liability.  As I have already  stated as a matter of public record, there is no question of the State seeking  to take this person's house.</p>
            <p eId="para_7291">My Department however cannot sustain a position whereby persons can take cases  against the State on the basis that, win or lose, they would get their costs.  This is not a financially sustainable position and would be grossly unfair to  the taxpayers of this country.  The State's position in all such cases has been  that it should not have been sued because the Minister for Education &amp; Science  has no direct involvement in the daily running of a school.  The Manager of a  school is directly responsible for the day-to-day operation and governance of a  school.  This position has been clearly conveyed by the State Claims Agency to  all such parties engaging in legal proceedings against my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_7304">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1030, 1034, 1051 and 1063 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7305">I wish to reassure the Deputies that I, along with my colleagues in Government,  recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background  can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  The Deputies may be aware that I met with representatives of the Church of  Ireland Board of Education, led by Archbishop John Neill, on 13 November last.</p>
            <p eId="para_7306">The meeting provided me with an opportunity to explain at first hand the  context for the budget changes that were of concern to the Bishops and the  schools serving the Church of Ireland and other minority churches. In the  course of the meeting, I confirmed my budget day announcement that the funding  provided through the Protestant Block grant was being continued by the  Government. I explained that against a backdrop of a difficult economic and  fiscal situation I had to take decisions that impacted on the staffing and the  range of funding grants to schools generally. The decision to cease paying  certain grants to the Protestant fee charging schools, which were not paid to  other fee charging schools, has to be viewed in that wider context.</p>
            <p eId="para_7307">I also stated that I would be willing to respond positively to any proposals  they might make on how the block grant could be better targeted to meet the  needs of the Protestant community, having regard to its dispersed population,  particularly in rural and border areas, and the need to sustain and support  Protestant schools.  I look forward to receiving those proposals in due course.  I recently received correspondence from the Secondary Education Committee, who  have sought a meeting with my officials to progress the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_7308">I also met with representatives of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland on 10  March, the first time their members have sent a delegation to Leinster House.   I briefed them on funding arrangements for Protestant schools and confirmed  that I would be willing to meet them again if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_7309">With the introduction of the free education scheme in 1967, it was recognised  that the level of funding was not sufficient to enable Protestant schools to  join the scheme, particularly given that many of their students had to board.</p>
            <p eId="para_7310">For that reason, separate arrangements were put in place to ensure that  Protestant students would be able to attend schools under Protestant  management.  However, Protestant fee-charging schools were never considered  part of the free education scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7311">The block grant, which is expected to be €6.5 million in this school year,  covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the  Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned.   Applications for assistance are made by parents to the Secondary Education  Committee which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to  individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.   This fund ensures that  necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p>

            <p eId="para_7315">I assume that the Deputy is referring to my Department's recent decision to  close a number of special classes.  There will be no pupil with a special  educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a  result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment  and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general  learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_7316">These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation  Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to  meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a  number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have  additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_7317">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the  General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence  special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the  pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their  peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so  that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7318">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on  pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio  that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a  teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was  not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no  longer qualifies to retain the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_7319">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional  teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these  classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of  these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as  pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and  schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.    This policy of inclusion has widespread support within the educational  community. This approach is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of  Persons with Disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7320">All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for  children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation  Model.  Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have  access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>

            <p eId="para_7330">In light of the administrative constraints on my Department I do not intend to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  At this time the priority within the resources available is to carry out the allocation processes which include the operation of redeployment panels and staffing appeals in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to outline the information sought by the Deputy could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_7331">The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_7337">As the Deputy may be aware, special needs assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to enable them support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_7338">There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs.  This includes over 10,000 SNAs — compared with just 300 in  1997.  In 2008, some schools would have had SNA posts withdrawn while other schools would have been allocated additional posts.  Overall in 2008, there was a net gain of 618 SNA posts in the school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_7339">SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles.  SNAs provide care support to pupils with special educational needs who have been assessed as having such needs while teachers deliver education to the pupils.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_7558">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving.  This includes the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board, under the Education Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The act is a progressive piece of legislation which raised the school leaving age to 16 or the completion of three years in senior cycle.  It changed the focus on non-attendance from sanctions to a welfare approach designed to tackle the underlying causes of absenteeism and also provides for young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who opt to leave school to take up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7559">The service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that the Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people.  Targeted interventions under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison services, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options.  Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of the DEIS programme.  In the current school year, €18.3m was paid in grants to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS.  These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provide for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support, for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7560">In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector working in various educational disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS.  Work is ongoing within the Department of Education and Science to enhance the delivery of its services through collaboration and integrated work between the NEWB and NCSE and various programmes operating under the School Support Programme initiatives.  The NEWB is also developing protocols for collaboration with agencies and services at regional and national level that provide services for children, young people and families.</p>
            <p eId="para_7561">My Department has also widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</p>
            <p eId="para_7562">Preventative measures are also in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL), with €31 million allocated to the School Completion Programme and in the region of €32 million allocated to HSCL for 2009.  Some 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools now participate in the School Completion Programme countrywide.  The Management Committees of SCP engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory and voluntary agencies in the development of annual retention plans.  The Local Retention Plans contain strategies for the whole-school, targeted strategies for individual students, and those who are already outside of the formal system.  Provision includes in-school, after-school and holiday time supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7563">The National Co-ordination Team of the School Completion Programme have also published Guidelines on Identifying Young People at Risk of Early School  Leaving in order to assist SCP projects identify good practices for targeting young people at risk of early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_7564">The Home School Community Liaison scheme is a major mainstream preventative strategy targeted at the families of pupils at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention.  HSCL focuses directly on the salient adults in children's educational lives, seeking indirect benefits for the children themselves and works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.  HSCL coordinators are assigned on a full time or shared basis between schools and are deployed to do full-time home school community liaison duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_7565">Progression from primary to second-level is recognised as a crucial transition period in a child's education.  Under the DEIS action plan, a continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of effective transfer programmes by building on the existing work of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7566">I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years to keep more young people in school and I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_7579">It should be noted that a single unit documented on the spreadsheet provided earlier does not purport to be one single classroom.

Single Units can often be made up of prefabs greater than the size of one classroom, e.g. 295m2 unit prefabs returned as one prefab by a school will often house more than one classroom.</p>

            <p eId="para_7581">My Department has been aware of a need for further post primary provision in the Dublin 15 area and in that context, I sanctioned the establishment of a new post primary school for the area last year.  The new school will be called Luttrellstown Community College and the Patron is County Dublin VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_7582">My Department is working closely with Co. Dublin VEC to open the new school in September 2009 and temporary accommodation has been identified to facilitate this development in post primary provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_7583">My Department will acquire a permanent site for the new school under the Fingal School Model Agreement.  A number of sites being acquired under the Fingal School Model agreement are at varying stages of acquisition including this site and, as the Deputy will appreciate, due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisition, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_7585">As outlined previously, existing education policy is that students up to 18 years of age are admitted to primary and second level schools irrespective of their nationality or status.  Indeed, under the Equal Status Act, schools may not discriminate in admission to schools except where this is necessary to maintain the religious values or ethos of the school.  While the Act does provide for differential treatment in relation to fees for further and higher education for persons who are not nationals of an EU Member State, there is no such condition specified in regard to second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7586">The admission of persons to the State from outside the EU, and the conditions which apply to their leave to remain, is a matter for the immigration authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7588">Following the introduction of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, including the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) service, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_7589">Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending. Accordingly, from September 2009, HSCL services will be withdrawn from schools which were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_7590">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in the 873 DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7597">I propose to take Questions  Nos. 1053 and 1083 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7598">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7599">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7600">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_7601">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009 including the schools referred to by the Deputies. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's  website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7602">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_7603">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

         the assistance available from his Department or agencies operating under the aegis of his Department regarding financial assistance for retraining and upskilling of those who have become unemployed in recent times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_12194">My Department funds a number of further education programmes that provide retraining and upskilling options for the unemployed.  These are both full-time and part-time and are delivered through the Vocational Education Committees (VECs).</p>
            <p eId="para_12195">The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second-chance education initiative for persons who are at least 21 years of age and more than six months unemployed.  VTOS aims to give participants education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_12196">VTOS participants are paid a training allowance in lieu of their previous qualifying social welfare payment and retain their social welfare secondary benefits.  A training bonus is paid to participants who have been in receipt of their social welfare payment for at least 12 months directly before joining VTOS.  Participants are entitled to a meal allowance and a travel allowance if they reside more than three miles from a centre.  They are also entitled to child support.  They benefit from free tuition, books, materials and access to the VEC adult guidance service.</p>
            <p eId="para_12197">VECs also provide Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses.  The PLC programme is a full time programme for students who have completed their leaving Certificate and for adults returning to education.  PLC participants may be eligible for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA).  The BTEA is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is a second chance educational opportunities scheme payable to people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education.  To qualify for the BTEA an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period.</p>
            <p eId="para_12198">The BTEA is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income.  In addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  PLC participants may also be entitled to a maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_12199">The Youthreach programme provides two years integrated education, training and work experience to young people aged 15-20 years who left school early without any qualifications or vocational training and are unemployed.  There are currently almost 3,700 Youthreach places available in VECs throughout the country.  Participants receive a weekly training allowance and also receive a meal and travel allowance.  They are also entitled to childcare support.</p>
            <p eId="para_12200">The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides flexible, part-time further education options to enable persons to combine a return to learning with family, work or other commitments.  Courses are free for all adults with a less than upper second level education, including the unemployed.</p>

This was the first such application from the school. The school, which has a current enrolment of 49 pupils, is situated in a rural area.</p>
            <p eId="para_12207">On foot of this application and information supplied by the school regarding its condition, officials from the Planning and Building Unit of my Department visited the school in June of last year.

            <p eId="para_12211">There were 40 major school projects for which design teams were appointed in 2006 to commence architectural planning. A further 14 design teams were appointed on major projects in 2007 and another 2 design teams were appointed in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_12212">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government established a Developing Areas Unit to identify where new schools were needed and ensure that they were delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_12213">This fast-track approach which, instead of the appointment of traditional design teams, involved the recruitment of Project Managers, with the assistance, where required, of architects, engineers and quantity surveyors to prepare the planning applications, undertake the necessary surveys and oversee the delivery of the schools  through a combined design and build process, commenced in late 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_12214">These two approaches, the traditional and the fast-track, delivered 48 new primary schools and 3 new post-primary schools in 2008. In addition, 29 major primary school extension and refurbishment projects and the 15 major post-primary extension and refurbishment projects were completed in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_12215">Taken together, the completion of these major projects reflect the concentration by my Department in 2008 on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country and represent an unprecedented level of achievement.</p>

            <p eId="para_12217">The following table lists the record number of major projects which were progressed to practical completion in 2008.  The list includes 48 new primary schools and 3 new post-primary schools, together with 29 major primary school extension/refurbishment projects and 15 major post-primary extension/refurbishment projects. It also shows the enrolment in each school for the 2008/2009 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_12218">Practical completion is reached when a project is certified as having been completed in accordance with the project brief and specifications and is ready for occupation, but, where a Final Account is not yet agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12219">Following practical completion, there is a 12 month period during which any snags have to be identified and made good by the building contractor.  A Final Account for each project is agreed after this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_12220">The Final Accounts for the projects that reached practical completion in 2008 have not yet been agreed so I cannot give the Deputy the individual final costs for these projects.  However, I can tell him that just over €300m has been spent on the construction of the 95 projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_12720">As part of the multi-annual school building programme, the Government has invested heavily in the modernisation of school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.</p>
            <p eId="para_12721">Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories.

            <p eId="para_12727">There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_12728">These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_12729">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD). Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_12730">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no  longer qualifies to retain the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_12731">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and  schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_12732">Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.  Specifically in the case of schools with DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) status, the Deputy will be aware of the additional resources available to these schools under the DEIS scheme. In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, this school is in DEIS Urban Band 1 and so benefits from a reduced pupil teacher ratio as well as additional supports including: the services of a Home School Community Liaison coordinator; allocation of a Disadvantaged Areas Scheme post; access to a range of supports under the School Completion Programme; additional capitation based on level of disadvantage and grant aid for school books.</p>
            <p eId="para_12733">In line with my focus on retaining resources in the most disadvantaged areas, it is important to note that DEIS schools which benefit from reduced class sizes will not be affected by the general increase in the pupil teacher ratio.</p>
            <p eId="para_12734">I understand that correspondence regarding the Special Class has been received in the Special Education Section in my Department from Scoil Bhríde and my Department will be in further contact with the school in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_12735">I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. However, there is a requirement to make appropriate use of the resources available and along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is dependent on the resources available to the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_12737">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_12738">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_12739">The school referred to by the Deputy has DEIS Urban Band 2 status and therefore qualifies for a range of supports including the following: additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage; additional financial allocation for school books; access to numeracy/literacy supports and programmes; access to Home School Community Liaison services; access to School Completion Programme; access to a range of professional development and planning supports; and access to the school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12740">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that were dissatisfied with their DEIS classification. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August, 2006. There was an application for review received from the school to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably, the school was unsuccessful in that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_12741">The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this for the school to be considered for reclassification from DEIS Band 2 to DEIS Band 1.</p>

The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_12752">All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>
            <p eId="para_12753">I have previously indicated that I am open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.  For example, where two schools on the one campus make a joint proposal to this effect, my Department will consider any such proposal. It would be expected, however, that provision would be made for these pupils within mainstream classes with support from the General Allocation Model.</p>

            <p eId="para_12757">The Deputy raises an issue concerning death-in-service benefits for a teacher who is a single parent.  On production of probate or letters of administration, a death gratuity is  payable to the teacher's personal representative (ie the executor named in the will or the administrator where a person dies without a will).  It is the greater of one year's pensionable remuneration (at the rate applicable at the teacher's death) or the amount of lump sum that would have been payable had the teacher retired on medical grounds at the date of death, subject to a maximum of 1½ times the teacher's pensionable remuneration at the date of death.  There is no minimum service requirement but a grant of probate is required in all cases before a benefit can be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_12758">If the teacher is a member of the Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme, an amount equal to a month's pay is payable to the spouse for the first month after death.  Thereafter spouses' and children's pensions will be payable based on the deceased teacher's potential service to compulsory retirement age (or 65 in the case of new entrants), subject to a maximum of 40 years.  There is an appropriate deduction made from the Death Gratuity in respect of this additional notional service.</p>
            <p eId="para_12759">In the case of members of the revised spouses' and children's arrangements under the Vocational Teachers Pension Scheme, dependent children under the age of 16 or age 22 if in full time education are eligible for a child's pension.  Where such a child is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining him or herself there is no age limit provided the infirmity existed from birth or arose while the child was eligible for benefit.  A child's pension is 1/3 of what a spouse's pension would be for each of the first three eligible children.  If there are more than three eligible children then an amount equal to the spouse's pension is divided among them.</p>
            <p eId="para_12760">Where both spouses are deceased and there is only one eligible child the amount of pension is 2/3 of what the deceased spouse's pension would be.

            <p eId="para_12764">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_12765">It is a matter for each Board of Management to have an enrolment policy and to then operate that policy in a fair and consistent manner having regard to the overall physical space capacity of a school. My Department has a responsibility to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in a school of their first choice. That is no more than a normal feature of the enrolment process in any community.</p>
            <p eId="para_12766">My Department will continue to ensure that those schools with the greatest increase in pupil numbers will still qualify for developing status thus enabling them to get their increased staffing in September 2009 — a year in advance of other schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_12767">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_12768">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12769">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_12770">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_12798">The Student Support Bill, which was published in February 2008 provides the  legislative framework for the reform of the administration of student grants  and the amalgamation of the existing four student grant schemes into a single  unified scheme which will be provided for by way of regulation.  The principal objective of the Bill is to create a more coherent system for the  administration of these grants, which will facilitate consistency of  application and improved client accessibility.  In brief, it will enable the  development of an awards system that can deliver grants on time to those who  need them most.</p>
            <p eId="para_12799">The Bill is part of an overall programme of legislative and administrative  reform, which will facilitate the introduction of significant service level  improvements in the administration of student grants, providing for greater  consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery  of grants to those who need them most. It will include guaranteed timeframes  for the assessment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more  efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments. This new,  significantly more customer-oriented system of administration will provide for  a more simplified and accessible applications system, much greater speed and  consistency in processing student grant applications, more transparency and  accountability in the awarding of grants and regular, on-time EFT payments for  students.</p>
            <p eId="para_12800">The passage of the Bill will facilitate progress on the development of a single  unified grant scheme and the streamlining of the administration of student  grants.  The Department is working closely with the IVEA and other relevant  stakeholders to develop the new administrative structures required to support  more efficient and effective delivery of the new unified grants scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_12804">A copy of a table listing schools renting prefabricated accommodation in Co. Clare follows.  The table includes the start dates of rental contracts for all schools listed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12805">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the  primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra  resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could  have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be  provided. However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as  soon as possible and, in some cases, this has involved the provision of  high-quality steel-framed prefabricated structures to accommodate them.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_13214">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, education, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements.</p>
            <p eId="para_13215">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways  depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which  any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation  processes.  Across the school system generally, there will of course be some  impact on class sizes, and the changes may impact on the capacity of individual  second-level schools to offer as wide a range of subject choices as heretofore.</p>
            <p eId="para_13216">Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment.  In accordance with these rules, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved  teacher allocation.  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range  of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in  the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_13217">In terms of the position at individual school level, the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn, and the data has since been received and processed in my Department, enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_13218">Initial allocation letters have issued to all post primary schools.  The  allocation is provisional at this stage and reflects the initial allocation  position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of  other factors, such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for  schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the  appeals processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13219">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support, i.e. curricular concessions.  This concession is available as a short-term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_13220">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.   The Board of Management of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board, which was established specifically to  adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools.  This  Board operates independently of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_13221">Discrete allocations are also made to post-primary schools to cater for pupils  with special educational needs and those with language difficulties, for  example, and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in  relation to any over quota position.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_13229">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1090, 1091 and 1098 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13230">There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability (MGLD).</p>
            <p eId="para_13231">These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_13232">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the  General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including MGLD. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_13233">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no longer qualifies to retain the second class.</p>
            <p eId="para_13234">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  This policy of inclusion has widespread support within the educational community. This approach is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_13235">All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_13236">I have previously indicated that I am open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.  It would be expected, however, that provision would be made for these pupils within mainstream classes with support from the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_13237">Pupils with a MGLD have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>

            <p eId="para_13244">Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_13245">These decisions included the decision to discontinue the annual funding of €97,000 that my Department made available to the Centre for Talented Youth (CTYI) at Dublin City University.</p>
            <p eId="para_13246">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of this funding will impact on the Centre, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  Tax revenues are down significantly and Government expenditure has to reflect this reality. The priority of this budget was to focus on measures to channel as much as was possible of the available resources to the direct funding of our schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_13249">An approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State, with the exception of the following:</p>

            <p eId="para_13258">The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. It identifies the objectives and learning outcomes which students should achieve in the general areas of  creating communicating and collaborating, thinking critically and creatively, understanding the social and personal impact of ICT, and developing foundational knowledge skills and concepts.</p>
            <p eId="para_13259">The National Centre for Technology in Education has been established to provide advice and support to schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning. The centre provides professional development programmes for teachers in ICT in collaboration with other agencies and teacher support services, a virtual learning environment, advice on ICT and e–learning planning. The Centre also co-ordinates the implementation of the schools broadband programme, and maintains an educational website portal — Scoilnet — which provides access to thousands of teacher reviewed resources. Nationwide seminars on e-learning for schools are being implemented at present. My Department is currently evaluating tenders for the next round of the Schools Broadband Programme, and the range of services available to schools is being expanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_13260">Under the Discover Science and Engineering programme funded by Forfás, some €5m is being spent annually to promote the take up of science engineering and technology in schools and colleges, and an awareness of the importance of these disciplines in society generally. The programme includes activities under  Science Week, Science clubs in schools, Science Excellence Awards, conferences and lectures, science quizzes, and the Scope TV programme. At second level, initiatives such as Discover Sensors, Nanoquest and Science On Stage are designed to promote interesting activities which stimulate student interest in science and technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_13261">Major reform in Mathematics at junior and senior cycle has also begun under the Project Maths Initiative. The objective is to teach Mathematics in a way which promotes real understanding, where students can appreciate the relevance of what they are learning and its application to everyday life, and how mathematics can be used to solve problems. In addition, Technology as a new subject in senior cycle was introduced in 2007, allied with a revised syllabus in Design and Graphic Communications. These subjects provide for a significant emphasis on student project work and on design, communication, ICT, CAD and practical skills and were accompanied by an investment of €15.5m in equipment for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13262">All Third Level Institutions regularly review their courses and these reviews usually include an industry representative. Most computing departments have advisory boards which include industry representation. In the computing industry where technology changes at a rapid rate there has to be a balance as to when new technological approaches get introduced into formal courses, soon enough to meet growing demand but not too soon to replace demand for existing technologies. The critical academic approach is to teach the fundaments correctly and then the new technologies can be learned as they develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_13263">The Government is committed to implementing the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation to significantly increase the research capacity, quality and output of the Irish higher education research system. The strategy has a particular focus on raising the quality of teaching and learning activities in the institutions. The overall strategy is overseen by an inter-Departmental Committee which reports to a Cabinet Committee on Science Technology and Innovation.  This work is informed by high level inputs from  industry and the industrial development agencies.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_13629">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1099 and 1101 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13630">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_13631">I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_13632">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_13633">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_13634">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_13635">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_13636">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_13638">The position is that applications have been received from three higher education institutions for designation as Universities; Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_13639">The issue of university designation does not just affect the institutions and the regions from which applications have been received; it also impacts on the future structure of the higher education system throughout the country. The Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole as well as the regions where they are based.</p>
            <p eId="para_13640">I have asked the strategy group on higher education to report to me before the end of the year with a two-decade road map for the development of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_13641">That group is now critically examining the roles and relationships of higher education institutions so that the system can deliver the levels of efficiency, performance, innovation and growth that will optimise Ireland's ‘smart' economic recovery and social development.</p>
            <p eId="para_13642">There are no plans to advance any of the current applications for university status before the strategy group completes its work.</p>
