          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I welcome the representatives from Anglo Irish Bank: Mr. Walter Tyrell, head of internal audit, Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the audit committee, and Ms Siobhan Whiston, internal auditor.  I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that members of the committee have absolute privilege but the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I propose to take a short presentation by Mr. Tyrell, to be followed by questions from members of the committee.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Walter Tyrell</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I am head of the internal audit function in Anglo Irish Bank.  I was appointed to that function in 2005 and prior to that I was head of Anglo Irish Assurance Company.  I have been with Anglo Irish Bank for 12 years.  I am accompanied by Ms Siobhan Whiston.  Siobhan joined the internal audit function in 2007.  Prior to that she was head of treasury operations in Anglo Irish Bank.  I am also accompanied by Mr. Frank Daly, who was appointed non-executive director to Anglo Irish Bank in December 2008.  He was appointed chairman of the audit committee of Anglo Irish Bank in January 2009.  Mr. Daly might be known to some of the members of the committee.  He is the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I will give the committee a brief overview of the reporting structure and the role of the internal audit function in Anglo Irish Bank.  I will cover our plan and how we approach our work.  I will also cover certain aspects of directors' loans and give an overview of the investigations currently taking place within the bank by outside agencies.  Unfortunately, there are limitations as to what I can cover.  I can cover the remit of the internal audit but not the remit of the external audit.  I also cannot give any details of the investigations that are currently ongoing.  In addition, from a confidentiality perspective I am not permitted to discuss individual customer, shareholder or employee details.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">First, I will outline the reporting structure of the internal audit function in Anglo Irish Bank.  I head the function.  Until December 2008 I reported to the then chief executive, Mr. David Drumm; I now report to the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Donal O'Connor.  I also report independently to the audit committee of the bank, which is currently chaired by Mr. Frank Daly.  Until January 2009 that committee was chaired by Mr. Gary McGann.  The committee comprises non-executive directors and meets formally seven times per year on average.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The role and resources of the internal audit department of Anglo Irish Bank are similar to those of internal audit departments of most large banks.  The internal audit function of our bank provides assurance to the board with regard to the day-to-day operational risks faced by the bank.  There are 17 staff in the internal audit function of the bank and all staff, including me, were recruited to the department since 2005.  Of those staff, 11 were recruited externally from either other banks or other professional firms.  My team comprises a diverse range of professionals ranging through IT security, IT audit, accountancy and investment.  We also engage the services of external professionals where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">We cover all the offices of Anglo Irish Bank, of which there are 21 split between Ireland, the UK, the United States and Europe.  We cover all the activities of Anglo Irish Bank, which is well known to the market.  Our loan book was €73 billion at the end of September 2008.  We also cover the treasury functions of the bank.  We raise money on the corporate deposit market and on the retail deposit market.  We have an extensive liquidity management team.  We offer our customers interest rate and foreign exchange rate products and we have a private banking unit based in Burlington Road in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The support functions we cover are, again, typical of any internal audit function of a bank such as ours.  We cover the IT, operations, HR and facilities functions.  We also work alongside the other independent functions in the bank, namely, the group finance, risk, compliance and company secretarial functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Regarding how we approach our work on an annual basis, our annual plan is approved each year by the audit committee, typically in November, as was the case in 2008.  It is a risk-based approach based on a hierarchy of risks based on, first, the impact they will have on the bank and, second, their likelihood of occurrence.  This conforms with Institute of Internal Auditors guidance and accepted best practice.  We complete, on average, 70 to 90 audited reports per annum and an essential part of our work is to follow up on the recommendations made in each of these reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I will give six examples of the work we carry out.  From a lending perspective, we examine the loan approval process, the obtaining of loan security through our legal panel, the loan drawdown procedures and the insurance on property that may be held as security for our borrowings.  From a dealing room perspective, we examine trader fraud, a common focus and concern for an internal auditor such as me.  This time last year Société Générale announced a €4.8 billion fraud in its dealing room and this would focus our attention on an ongoing basis.  In the dealing room we examine the segregation of duties between the back and front offices and the independent risk management function.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">We examine payments going out of the bank.  On average, 2,500 payments leave the bank daily which, on average, total between €2.5 billion and €4 billion.  Our key focus is to ensure each of these payments goes to the correct payee account and no fraudster can get in the way and divert payments to an incorrect account.  We examine the private banking unit and the asset valuation methodology in the unit and possible mis-selling practices and ensure there are controls in place to prevent it.  We also examine the customer report within our private banking unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We have an extensive IT function in Anglo Irish Bank and a comprehensive IT unit in the internal audit function.  We examine systems security, intruder prevention, hacker prevention, data loss and laptop theft which was mentioned in the press extensively in 2008.  We look at access, system permission control and data encryption, particularly when transferring data between the bank and a customer.  We examine business continuity and instant recovery.  We have a number of data centres in the bank and a number of backup centres.  We continually test the backup procedures in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">In terms of our being reviewed in the internal audit function, in 2004 a big four audit and advisory firm conducted a review of the internal audit function at the behest of the then audit committee.  Its conclusion is listed in the fourth bullet point on slide No. 11.  In addition, we meet the regulators on an ongoing basis.  Our two main regulators are the Financial Regulator in Dublin and the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom.  They receive copies of our reports, where relevant.  While we meet the Financial Regulator more often than we meet the FSA, there is good communication.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I have set out the difference between internal and external audit on slide No. 12.  Our focus is to test the operational risks and controls in the bank and report to the audit committee with recommendations for improvement.  We are not involved in the audit of the financial statements.  The external auditors' primary focus is on testing the financial reporting and internal controls on which they wish to place reliance.  They also perform other audit procedures on significant figures in the annual financial statements.  They give an opinion on whether the financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the appropriate standards and companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">On slide No. 13 I have set out our basis for the auditing of the loan book.  In Anglo Irish Bank internal audit, in carrying out a review of the loan book, we use a statistical sampling basis to select loans throughout the book.  This is in line with best practice.  It is a robust process and we have specialist software to assist us.  Directors' loans were included with all other loans within the population for view.  Several directors' loans have been identified in the test samples in the years since I took over as head of internal audit.  The statistical sampling did not select Mr. FitzPatrick's loans; however, in 2008 a loan in which he was a partner investor was selected and reviewed in full by us.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The loans of Mr. FitzPatrick, the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, were temporarily refinanced with another financial institution before the bank's year end.  This refinancing impacted on the disclosures regarding Mr. FitzPatrick's loans.  As the chairman stated at the EGM on 16 January, this practice was wrong and unacceptable.  An initial statement on Mr. FitzPatrick's loans was issued to the market on 18 December 2008 which gave initial details of the loans involved and a governance review chaired by Mr. Daly which had been initiated by the bank.  We made further releases to the market and the public on 16 January through the chairman when he made his EGM statement.  We intend to make a more comprehensive and fuller disclosure on directors' loans and all other instances of interest to the reader of the accounts when our financial statements for the year ended September 2008 are published.  We expect this to happen towards the end of the month.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">How did Mr. FitzPatrick's loans operate?  They were in the ordinary course of business and all the facilities were secured.  Mr. FitzPatrick is and was personally liable for them.  They are on normal commercial terms, have been approved by the credit committee and are and have been reviewed in line with the bank's credit risk policy twice every year from a credit perspective.  That review is carried out by an independent credit risk function in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">What did not work in the case of Mr. FitzPatrick's loans?  There was a movement of funds around the balance sheet date.  This temporary refinancing occurred with another financial institution.  What is the issue with Mr. FitzPatrick's loans?  There was no reporting of ongoing movements of directors' loans to the board.  This was not identified as high risk by the bank.  What has happened since the issue of Mr. FitzPatrick's loans became known to the bank?  In January 2008 the Financial Regulator communicated with the then finance director.  The bank sought legal advice on the company law aspect of Mr. FitzPatrick's loans and that advice was passed to the regulator.  Mr. FitzPatrick reported the matter to board members on 16 and 17 December 2008 and resigned as chairman of the bank on 18 December.  Mr. Lar Bradshaw, another director, resigned on the same day, and Mr. David Drumm, chief executive officer, resigned on the following day.  Mr. Willie McAteer, finance and risk director, resigned on 17 January this year.  Following nationalisation after the EGM, five other non-executive directors resigned on 19 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">What is being done about this issue?  As I stated, the board has initiated an independent governance review, to be completed by Mason, Hayes and Curran, on which I will touch.  External parties to the bank have initiated their own reviews, namely, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Financial Regulator and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  Their reviews will be conducted through the Irish Audit and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  The independent review, to be carried out by Mason, Hayes and Curran, will be led by Mr. Declan Moylan, chairman of that firm.  It will be overseen by a new, independent board committee in the bank chaired by Mr. Frank Daly.  All aspects of Mr. FitzPatrick's loans and other directors' loans will be covered in the review, the aim of which is to establish the facts, set out the lessons that need to be learned and recommend best practice for the bank.  Its recommendations will be acted on and published in due course.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Paul Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I welcome Mr. Daly, Mr. Tyrell and Ms Whiston.  With Mr. Daly and his new chairman, I take it that everything is almost perfect and that they have initiated much of what is to happen with Mason, Hayes and Curran and others.  Are the delegates free to tell us about the communication they have had with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement?  Taking it that matters are now right, are any directors from the old board still in place?  There was an internal audit team before this team a few years ago.  Did it learn much or get many shocks when it took over from the previous internal audit unit?  As Mr. Daly is totally new to it, I refer that question to Mr. Tyrell.  The delegates have said there are certain things they cannot tell us.  We must accept this, but would they say we have much yet to learn and that there are shocks yet to be revealed?  In so far as they can, will they comment on what we have yet to learn?</p>

Part of the reason for this related to the internal audit function and its relationship with the group chief executive.

The objective of the review is to establish exactly what happened, who knew what and how it was allowed to happen, and to ensure it does not happen again.  A series of recommendations will arise from the review which I predict will produce the best possible practice arrangements in terms of the control of directors' loans.  This goes back to the appropriateness of the scale of directors' loans, how they are sanctioned, what oversight is provided for, and what function the audit team, credit committee and board should have in regard to these loans.  Mr. Moylan has been given the authority by the board to engage external — by which I mean external to Ireland — expertise.  He has identified somebody who is internationally acknowledged as exemplifying best practice in banking and audit.</p>

If I ask this question I am doing so as a layman who seeks an understanding, on behalf of the people who are looking at Anglo Irish Bank and wondering what in God’s name is going on.  We are trying to get an understanding of how the financial regulatory system works in terms of banking operations and how risk management and internal auditing functions are carried out.

We would look at it from a lending perspective as we do with all loans in the bank, to which I alluded.  If the borrower is a director, non-director, shareholder or any other person we approach the loan book in the same way because we are looking at the lending controls, the internal controls in the bank, and making sure the loans are sanctioned in accordance with policy.  As I stated, it is not for me to comment on shareholder issues and it is not an area in which I get involved.  When we issue the 2008 annual report at the end of this month, there will be significant and substantial disclosures on shareholder issues as there is in our report on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">That is one guy on one side, but it occurred eight times in Anglo Irish Bank, which means it was not unique.  Mr. Tyrell has stated at least ten people within the bank — I would guess many more — knew about this so-called short-term refinancing.  The picture is one of individuals in the bank knowing about it, but not blowing the whistle, which is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I will address the matter of sampling.  For some extraordinary reason, Mr. FitzPatrick's loan was never hit by the sampling method.  That was lucky for the director.  Is Mr. Tyrell saying the loan was picked up by the sampling method in 2008?</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Our sampling method is in line with best international auditing practice.  We use a statistical sampling method to review loans in the loan book.  We carried out reviews of Mr. FitzPatrick's loan, but it did not arise in our statistical sampling model.  Using the statistical sampling model, we selected other directors' loans for review and found nothing adverse.</p>

The sampling detected another loan with which he was associated.  I would have put all his loans together.  Since Mr. Tyrell knew Mr. FitzPatrick had loans and had been sampled, he had a duty at that stage to investigate the matter further.  There was an environment in the bank in which many turned a blind eye to the work of the boss.  That is the way it appears.</p>

If the sampling picks out a person or partnership with a loan and the internal auditor knows that such a person has other loans, surely any internal audit procedures would suggest putting the two together and examining the matter, but perhaps this is not the case.  In the sampling is use made of IT methods?  I do not know what the system is, but does the IT method suggest the auditors pick every seventh or eighth file, or does it select the name associated with the loan to review?  I wish to know this, if possible, as there are many methods.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I will not delay the meeting for long.  This bank saga reminds me of a story about a person who went to confession.  He said he had no sins to confess.  The person was a saint.  The priest asked if he had any past sins.  The answer was: "Sorry, the less said the better."  In this case, the less said the better.  The bank story seems to be like a fictional soap opera; it is unbelievable.  I cannot believe it, nor can the people.  I will not give a plug to the television programmes that ran for years which were fictional and unreal, but this is unbelievable.  Nobody on the street who has any common sense can believe what is emerging.  It seems everybody had a great time playing bank, as people played games such as Monopoly years ago.  Anglo Irish Bank was playing it for real and everybody was getting and using money.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I welcome Mr. Frank Daly who has a reputation second to none.  Therefore, I hope things will change.  He is a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  When the Revenue Commissioners conduct an audit — like many others, I have personal experience of such audits — they ask one what one had for one's breakfast or tell one what one had.  I am sure Mr. Daly will be able to give lessons in auditing that are badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Consider the seriousness of what we have got ourselves into.  I do not believe people in this sector realise the responsibility they have to the country and its people.  It is a global issue but we are particularly interested in our country and its people.  It would be the greatest joke in the history of the State only for the serious way it affected the lives of ordinary decent people.  My request which I hope will not fall on deaf ears is that people in the Irish banking sector put the country and its people before greed.  I hope a lesson will be learned from this.  It is unbelievable.  One could listen to this story for months but the more one hears it, the less one believes it.  Did it actually happen?  This actually happened in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I am seeking a better understanding of the submissions being made to the committee.  No human being with any sense of reason could believe that if a chairman of one of the banks in Ireland approached that bank for a loan, he or she would be subject to the same stringent internal audit procedures as, for example, me, if I sought a loan from Anglo Irish Bank.  The delegates cannot realistically expect us or the people to believe what has been said about the internal auditing procedures as they applied to the loans of various directors.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I am trying to look at this from the perspective of an ordinary shareholder such as a pensioner who had ordinary shares in the bank as an investment and was hoping for a return on that investment in their autumn or winter years.  There appears to be a sense of duplicity in how internal auditing procedures were effected with regard to directors' loans and how they were effected in the case of other loans such as to business.  I spoke about the contracts for difference.  I am anxious to understand before I leave this committee whether there was a procedure whereby loans were made to individuals who were shareholders for the purpose of purchasing shares, where contracts for difference were transferred into ordinary shares, if I understand the process correctly.  I have not received a satisfactory answer to assist my understanding of how the internal auditing procedures operate in such instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">It has been stated publicly or in the press that there were a number of what I call "angel investors" who assisted shareholders for the purpose of buying what was reported to be a 10% shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is also stated some of those were existing shareholders.  We are trying to find out the extent of the borrowings, what was used as collateral for these borrowings and whether there was a reporting procedure to the Department of Finance.  The delegates have stated they cannot talk about individual shareholders; therefore, I will put my question in another way.  If somebody who is a shareholder purchases shares and takes out a loan from Anglo Irish Bank for the purpose of purchasing these shares, is there an internal auditing procedure in that regard and is there a reporting procedure that must be undertaken to the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator?</p>

          <p eId="para_313">The Deputy mentioned customer confidentiality.  Certainly, in established banking practice it would be wrong for the bank to refer to any individual or group of individuals.  I realise there has been speculation and comment regarding share transactions that took place during 2008 but it is very difficult for the bank to comment on these.  I can confirm that in the normal course of business the bank, like others, advances funds on commercial terms to customers for the purpose of investing in listed equities which would sometimes include the bank's own shares.  It is very difficult for me to say any more than this today.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Deputy mentioned contracts for difference.  Speaking independently — not for the bank — everybody acknowledges that there is a gaping hole somewhere in the regulatory framework for contracts for difference.  In fact, in some ways one cannot ask an internal audit group in a bank to look at contracts for difference because by definition such contracts do not surface until a stage when it is difficult to do anything about them.</p>

The reality is they were not.  They were all in the same area; they were all selected for examination by this statistical sampling.  If anything, what went wrong is that we should have placed them in a category and attached a weighting to directors' loans.  As I assured the committee, that is what will happen.</p>

I can see Deputy Ardagh's line of questioning.  Areas where we would co-operate with the external audit are primarily based on the area of IT security.  We have an IT audit team and they have an IT audit team and they would communicate on work they are doing together or separately.  But in terms of the work Ernst &amp; Young come in and do as an annual audit, our involvement in that is limited.  I refer to that issue in slide No. 12.</p>

The Commission on Taxation is discussing the possibility of raising taxes from property and other areas.  Mr. Daly is probably not a major shareholder in the banks.  Nevertheless, as a director of a bank, how does he erect a Chinese wall between his banking function and his role in recommending whether further taxes be imposed on the banking sector?  Does a conflict arise in this regard and, if so, how does he manage this conflict?</p>

However, having asked myself the question, I give myself permission to say I am not a shareholder.

I had hoped to avoid this following my period in the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I do not have a difficulty with my roles, as I compartmentalise my mind.  I am not the only member of the Commission on Taxation.  There are 17 of us around the table and if I were in any way disposed to be influenced by my new role in Anglo Irish Bank, 16 other members of the commission would quickly draw my attention to the matter.  I do not have any difficulty in managing that conflict.  I hope my role on the Commission on Taxation will be short term.  I cannot say what will be the position with regard to Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I sat through the EGM of Anglo Irish Bank in the Mansion House and share the sense of frustration, hurt and anger expressed at the meeting.  The bank has been nationalised and the best result for it and the taxpayers who now own it will be for it to go forward as a successful commercial operation.  It is on this objective that the new board is focused.  We will build on the commercial end and attracting deposits.  We will have a good lending policy, perhaps lending in areas in which the bank did not lend in the past, and, above all, we will have a culture at the bank of doing the right thing.  It is not enough to do what is legal; we need to do what is right and proper.  That is the ethic we will have in the bank in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Many have taken a great deal of stick in recent times about what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  I am impressed with the bank staff and managers I have come across in recent weeks.  They, too, are annoyed, hurt and, in some cases, bitter about what has happened to the bank.  They have many skills and significant commercial expertise.  Our job, as a new board, is to leverage this for the future.  A good, commercially well run operation is the best outcome for the taxpayer who owns Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">There is much talk about the loans.  Part of being a commercial operation is that one looks at one's loan book and pursues loans rigorously.  The bank will also do this.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">Mr. Daly referred to the future of Anglo Irish Bank.  People have lost trust in the banking sector, including Anglo Irish Bank.  Restoring this trust requires that the issues which arose are addressed in an orderly fashion.  Members of the public are entitled to receive answers to questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Mr. Daly referred to the extraordinary general meeting of Anglo Irish Bank.  Elderly people invested their money in the bank's shares which they regarded as their pension fund.  These shares are virtually worthless and shareholders are waiting to learn what is their residual value.  There is nothing personal about today's proceedings.  We simply want questions answered on behalf of taxpayers who effectively own the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The internal auditors will have met the Financial Regulator once or twice a year.  Did the office of the Financial Regulator not raise the issue of loans to directors between 2005 and 2008?</p>

          <p eId="para_458">I would appreciate it if Mr. Tyrell were to get back to the committee on the matter.  Having spoken to representatives of many credit unions, I am informed that the first action staff from the Office of the Financial Regulator take when they visit credit union offices is to examine directors' loans and deposits.  It is beyond belief the directors' book would not be examined first.  My information is that directors' books, even in the smallest credit unions, are the first items to be examined.</p>
