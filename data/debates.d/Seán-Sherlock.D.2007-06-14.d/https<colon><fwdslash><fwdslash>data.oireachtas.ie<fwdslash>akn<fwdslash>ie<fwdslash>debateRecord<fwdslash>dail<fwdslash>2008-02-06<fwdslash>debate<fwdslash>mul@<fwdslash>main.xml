          <p eId="para_2">I am glad to see the Taoiseach's annual mark is as clear as ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Few things in life are more important to a family than the birth of a child.  Few things cause people more confusion than to receive a determination of something that will place that child at a disadvantage.  Probably nothing causes more anger and consternation in families than when the State fails in its duty to provide for such children.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">As Members meet this morning, approximately 150 cases remain backed up in the High Court involving parents who, by virtue of a no-appeals mechanism, have been forced to bring their cases to court for determination and to have their wishes regarding education for their children followed through.  This issue is highly sensitive.  Every year, approximately 11,000 children present with special needs nationwide.  The Government and the Minister for Education and Science are implacably opposed to any extension of the applied behavioural analysis, ABA, system beyond the 12 pilot schools that were determined by the Minister's predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">No one knows a child better than his or her mother.  Although the Constitution purports to treat the children of the nation equally, those children who live close to the 12 ABA units at least have a chance of gaining access to them if it is determined that this constitutes the best education for them.  However, this is not the case in the vast majority of other locations nationwide.  This causes parents enormous consternation and anger, some of whom are before the High Court as I speak to defend their right to have the State provide the most appropriate education for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Although the Taoiseach has been head of Government for ten years, it takes parents between two and seven years to get an assessment for their children.  This constitutes a national scandal.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">I refer to the anger, frustration and consternation with which people are obliged to put up.  When will the Taoiseach do something about this issue?  Second, why is no appeals mechanism available to parents in respect of their children, thereby forcing them to go to the High Court?  A total of 150 cases remain outstanding and an entire industry has been spawned by defending the State with taxpayers' money against the interests of parents who seek an education for their children.  I ask the Taoiseach to deal with these two questions.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_12">When parents choose to take a case against the State and the Department or agencies involved are satisfied that what is being provided is correct, the latter must defend the action, which is what has happened in a number of cases.  Obviously, to answer Deputy Kenny directly, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique, such children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  While applied behavioural analysis is one such method used in special classes for children with autism, it is only one.  In addition, the findings of the task force on autism, as well as international best practice, support the view that it is not the only option and that a range of approaches should be used, rather than only one.  Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on a single approach and the Government has followed this advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The number of special classes for children with autism has increased dramatically in recent years to the extent that, at present, there are more than 270 such classes nationwide.  In the absence of the excessive network of special classes that obtained some years ago, 12 centres were approved for funding under the ABA programme.  New ABA centres have not been approved in recent years because a network of special classes is now available.  Consequently, it is not that the Minister is opposed to extending them but rather a range of special classes now exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The Government is committed to long-term funding for the existing 12 projects subject to agreement on certain standards, such as those pertaining to appropriate qualifications for the staff and to the type of educational programmes available to the children.  Many ABA tutors have no formal teaching or other professional qualifications and discussions have commenced and are ongoing with Irish autism groups and a number of the pilot centres on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">In addition, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is working extremely hard to encourage more schools to accept children with autism.  It is experiencing considerable success, either in mainstream classes with resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNA, support, where appropriate, or in special classes if that is the child's parents' preference.  Schools that agree to open special classes are allocated additional staff and equipment grants.  Moreover, for a number of years, additional accommodation for such classes has been given priority in the building programme.  A team of 80 special educational needs organisers has been put in place by the NCSE to help parents secure appropriate places for their children and children who are awaiting a place can also get home tuition paid for by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">There has been under-provision in this area historically.  Until perhaps eight years ago, few or no resources were being put into special education in this country, or at least the amount was very small.  It takes time to bring the services up to an optimum level but we have been making great improvements and are continuing to put enormous resources into this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I have just touched on autism but, in respect of special educational needs generally, there are now thousands of staff working in the education system whereas there used to be only a handful.  There are approximately 17,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs compared to a few hundred a few years ago.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I did not say the ABA system was the only method of providing education to autistic children.  In recognising that extra moneys have been pumped into this sector, it seems that the failure of the Government to allow for an assessment system in the first place causes personal consternation and anger among parents of children with special educational needs, be it autism or another condition.  That the Government has failed to deliver an assessment system within a short period is the root cause of much of this anger.  Can the Taoiseach state what evaluation has been carried out on the pilot schemes in the designated ABA centres?  What is the waiting list for ABA pupils in those centres?  Has the Government made a definitive decision not to proceed with an expansion of the pilot scheme or are centres to be established in other locations around the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_19">In general, the social experiment of putting all the children with special educational needs into mainstream schools is not working as envisaged.  Teachers face difficulties due to a lack of resources in spite of increases in the number of special educational needs assistants.  Speech and occupational therapists who work in special needs schools are contracted to the HSE and not the Department of Education and Science, although the problem is an educational need as distinct from a medical one.  Different holiday regimes apply in the HSE and the Department.  It is wrong to suggest that the State is doing all it can when it is clear that the root cause is the failure to carry out assessments.  Moreover, there is no post-assessment appeals mechanism that does not require parents to borrow money from credit unions and financial institutions on the pretext of doing up their houses.  The money is really intended for individual ABA tutoring, sometimes in the parents' homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">One of the great scandals of the Governments over which the Taoiseach has presided has been the failure to deal with the root problem, that is, the inability to have an early assessment.  I am quite sure that, as a public representative, the Taoiseach has met parents of children with special educational needs, be they autistic or otherwise, whose frustration is caused by the failure of the State to address their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">What will the Taoiseach do to enable earlier assessments?  Will he introduce an appeals system so parents will not be required to fight their cases against the State in the High Court?   How many are on the waiting list for ABA?  I understand there are approximately 400.  Will the Government extend the pilot scheme to more than 12 units, as it originally proposed?  What is the Taoiseach's view on the contracting of specialists, including speech and occupational therapists, to the HSE when they should be contracted to the Department of Education and Science?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_22">The commitment is for the continuation of the initiatives in the 12 pilot schools.  That does not mean that, by extension, there are no new ABA places because ABA is offered in the mainstream schools.  The whole point is that ABA is not just available in the pilot units or what will become mainstream schools anyway, but that one can also get that educational opportunity in a mainstream school.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Please, I am responding to Deputy Kenny.  I heard Deputy Kenny state he does not believe the placing of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream schools is suitable in all cases.  Eight years ago there would have been no more than a few hundred teachers fully involved with special educational needs.  Subject to correction, I believe there were approximately 300 or 400.  The view of all the experts and in all the reports was that if the children with special needs — there are multiple reasons for such needs — are placed in classes in mainstream schools, they can go to their local school, be with the children they grow up with in their communities, have access to fully qualified teachers and the normal curriculum and integrate with other children from an early age.  That is what every report in the 1980s and 1990s suggested should be done in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">We started out on that road and there are now approximately 17,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special educational needs.  The Government has made improvements in the area of special education and has made it a major priority.  Some €900 million is now being spent on education for students with special needs.  Last year or the year before, there was a 40% increase in funding.  We have continued to provide resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">One of the fundamental reasons is to give children an opportunity to get into school.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I accept that there was a poor approach to assessments in the past and that it will take time for us to have assessments for everybody — I am not arguing about that.  However, when we held the discussions on the Disability Act 2005, with which I was deeply involved, we proposed a new entitlement in the legislation for assessments for children under five.  It came into effect in June 2007 and will ensure children are assessed at an early age.  The parents, medics and paramedics say the way to get it right is to make the assessment at a very young age.  Deputy Kenny said this himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Improvements are also on the way in respect of access to health therapies.  The programme's commitment is to use the National Treatment Purchase Fund to provide therapies for children under five who have been waiting for three months.  I do not know the precise figure but Deputy Kenny stated there are 400 on the waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Schools that agree to open special classes get extra staff.  Extra accommodation is being made available.  I stated 80 special educational needs organisers have been in place to help parents get the appropriate place for their child.  If one believes everything is not perfect, one should realise we have made an enormous attempt to deal with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">On co-ordination, Deputy Kenny made the point that both the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Science are involved with special educational needs in schools.  It is for that reason that I asked the Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, Deputy Devins, to assume a co-ordinating role between both Departments in respect of both policy and implementation.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">The Irish Cancer Society told us yesterday that up to 30,000 cancer cases are being diagnosed in the State each year.  This is a significant number in a country of just over 4 million.  The society tells us that the numbers are increasing and that, in the next 12 years, we may face a cancer epidemic.  On several occasions before Christmas we had exchanges in this House about cancer treatment and things that went wrong in cancer treatment.  There was the sad and tragic case of Susie Long, known to radio listeners as Rosie, as well as the case of the women in Portlaoise who were given the all-clear for breast cancer and then were called back for re-examination.  There were several other cases of misdiagnosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">On each occasion that we raised these issues with the Taoiseach and the absent Minister for Health and Children, the answer we were given was that investigations were under way, reports would be presented and that we could not get answers to what went wrong in these cases until we had the reports.  Five such investigations are still under way.  These are the Dr. Ann O'Doherty report into the cases of suspected breast cancer misdiagnosis in Portlaoise, which was to have been completed by the end of November but is still not published; the review by John Fitzgerald into the circumstances surrounding the release of information on the misdiagnosis of breast cancer in Portlaoise, which is still not completed; the report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the circumstances surrounding the misdiagnosis in the case of Rebecca O'Malley, which was due to be published in December but has not yet been produced; the report by HIQA of a review of pathology services at University College Hospital, Galway, in the wake of another breast cancer misdiagnosis where a woman was twice wrongly given the all-clear, which is still not completed; and the internal report by Cork University Hospital regarding the appointment of a pathologist despite the fact that his work was subject to two reviews in Finland.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">These five reports are still ongoing and have not been produced.  There have been no answers for the patients concerned, their families and the wider public.  When will these reports be produced and published and answers provided to the questions we first raised last October and November?</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Following concerns raised by staff in the breast service, the HSE set up a clinical review last autumn of all breast radiology diagnoses in the Midland Regional Hospital from November 2003 to August 2007.  That review was led by Dr. Ann O'Doherty, a consultant radiologist at St. Vincent's University Hospital and with BreastCheck.  The HSE has advised that this review is complete.  Nine women were identified as having a diagnosis of cancer and all nine have been offered appropriate treatment.  A clinical review of ultrasounds at Portlaoise is also complete and no cancers were detected in this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that a report on the reviews will be published by the HSE when the necessary legal requirements have been completed.  A target date of the end of this month has been set for publication.  The legal issues relate to the necessity to give an opportunity to those who are mentioned in the report to make their defence or their statements.  The suspension of mammography services at Portlaoise continues pending publication of these reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The Minister for Health and Children has asked the chief executive officer of the HSE for a report on the circumstances that led to the decisions of the executive to suspend the breast radiology services at the hospital, place a consultant radiologist on administrative leave and initiate a clinical review of the services.  That report, which was led by Dr. Ann O'Doherty, has been completed and will be submitted to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  The Minister also asked for a report from the board of the HSE on the management of all events starting from and subsequent to these decisions.  That report is being undertaken by Mr. John Fitzgerald.  It is not finished but is being drafted.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I will check the position on the Cork case.  As I understand, the report on that was prepared.  The clinician involved was only in Cork for a short period before he was suspended and then left the jurisdiction.  I understand Deputy Gilmore's question relates to how this person was appointed in the first place.  I will raise that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The HSE has informed me that there are two aspects to the Dr. Ann O'Doherty report.  First, there are the nine women who were identified as having a diagnosis of cancer and, second, there is the clinical review of the ultrasounds, which is also complete and no cancers were detected in that review.  The HSE has informed the Department of Health and Children that the report on the reviews will be published by the executive as soon as the necessary legal requirements have been completed.  Its target date, as I said, is the end of the month.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The third part of the review is that the Minister for Health and Children asked the chief executive officer of the HSE for a report on the circumstances that led to the decision of the HSE to suspend the breast radiology services in the hospital.  That report, which was done by a review group led by Dr. O'Doherty, has been completed and submitted to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  It does not say in my information that this report will be published.  The fourth element is the Minister's request for a report from the board of the HSE on the management of all events starting from and subsequent to these decisions.  This report, which is being undertaken by John Fitzgerald, is not complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I will ask the Department about the Deputy's query regarding Galway.  I have received no information on that.</p>

Is there a body in the Taoiseach's Department, or a group of public servants, which deal with this?  Does it have ongoing contacts with its counterparts in Newfoundland?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_65">In fairness to him, John Bruton put a considerable effort into this project.  It was the one thing he asked me to keep going.  At the time, we brought it back to my Department and we put in place a dedicated small group which drives it.  It is very active and it has been built on from that time.  There is a considerable amount of collaboration.  It has developed in many areas and there is much contact on the marine side because of Newfoundland's considerable knowledge of the marine.  Although I do not know the figure off the top of my head, quite a large number of Irish business people have become involved in business working with the partnership.  Several joint studies have been done and there has been a large number of delegations, mainly business ones but also teaching and academic ones.  Each year there is a dedicated programme.  It has been a very good project with a very small number of dedicated people.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">The last few Prime Ministers of Newfoundland have visited here several times and they take the project very seriously because of the connections.  I think 60% to 70% of Newfoundland's population is of Irish origin.  The project has moved from being a cultural one, although that aspect continues and many books have been written and publications produced.  It has developed particularly on the marine side because Newfoundland is very sophisticated and advanced in this area.  It has worked here exchanging its technology, research and exploration, which is a major issue for it because its livelihood depends on it.  It has proved to be a very successful project and continues to involve a large number of people.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">What is the cost of the communications unit in the Taoiseach's Department?  If I recall correctly, a number of weeks ago the Taoiseach said that one of the fundamental reasons for having the unit in his Department was that it cut out the requirement on other Departments to collect information.  Yet questions tabled in the last two weeks clearly pointed out an extraordinary amount of money being spent by Departments on agencies collecting newspaper cuttings and bits and pieces of information.  Was the communications unit set up to do away with the requirement on other Departments to collect information and spend money on agencies to provide them with these newspaper cuttings?  Yet they still seem to be doing this.  What is the position?  Does the Taoiseach's communications unit, whatever it costs, dispense that information to Ministers and Departments?  If so, does that mean Departments should not have to employ agencies to engage in newspaper cutting exercises?</p>

            <p eId="para_68">That is it.  Most Departments use it on a daily basis and several hundred people receive the news format everyday.  If they want transcripts or information, they get that as well.  I do not see why any of them are using anything else, particularly for audio and written information.  What happened previously was that every Department and agency had contracts with these organisations.  The only media not covered is rural radio stations and rural newspapers.  It covers the national radio stations and national newspapers.</p>

It seems a bit wasteful that Departments are going elsewhere if the Taoiseach's Department's media monitoring unit is providing the service.</p>

The remaining part of the commemoration of that finishes in the middle of April.  There are usually commemorations North and South for which funding is applied.  They are mainly historical events, depending on the anniversary.  Historical societies receive this money but must make a submission which is considered by the section in the Department.  Sometimes they receive a big grant but mostly they receive grants of €25,000 or €30,000.  They also receive help to produce books and in the past few years, Robert Emmet, the flight of the earls and the man from Foxford, County Mayo, of whose name Deputy Kenny will remind me, have been covered.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">On the organisational review programme, two years ago we asked the implementation group of Secretaries General to develop proposals on four interlinked initiatives on the next phase of modernisation of the public service which comes within the remit of my Department.  This includes a series of organisational health checks.  It is known as the organisational review programme.  Organisational reviews will examine the capabilities of Departments to meet their current service delivery requirements and deal effectively with future changes in direction and new challenges.  It comes under the group of Secretaries General across Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Specifically, the reviews will look at the structures, capabilities, procedures and leadership capabilities across the Civil Service.  The organisational review programme will comprise eight staff — four principal officers, one assistant principal, two administrative officers and one clerical officer.  The four principal posts are filled by principal officers seconded from the Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The remainder of the team will come from within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">Some €760,000 is being provided for this year to cover the cost which is mainly salaries — €660,000; travel and subsistence — €10,000; publication of reports — €30,000; and consultancy — €50,000.

            <p eId="para_78">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  With regard to the commemorations, I would like him to look at the possibility of providing funding for commemoration of the sinking of the <i>RMS Leinster</i>, which was the biggest sea tragedy we have experienced and which was sunk by a German U-boat while carrying many of the soldiers who were going back to fight at the front in the First World War.  It was an episode in our history that was buried for many decades for historical reasons.  In recent years, there have been commemorations of that event and the Taoiseach might look at it as something worthy of State support.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">We all agree that carrying out a health check on the performance of the public service is desirable.  Is this analysis going to take account in any way of the impact of decentralisation on the performance of the public service, especially the Civil Service?  Most Departments have not carried out a risk analysis of the decentralisation process and how it will impact on the overall performance of the relevant Departments.  Is the impact of decentralisation on the performance of the Civil Service to be included in the terms of reference of this particular examination?</p>

The examination will take everything into account.  It is trying to figure out where these Departments will be over the next number of years.  The senior civil servants such as Secretaries General will look at how they can improve their efficiencies and the structures they operate, which will obviously take decentralisation into account, but they will also look at their capabilities, procedures and leadership capacities.  The examination will take in a broad range of how to go forward over five to ten years.  It will be a comprehensive review.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I have two questions on the Estimates.  There has been a provision of €5,000 for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Is it not time formally to wind up this forum, which has long served its purpose?  Does the Taoiseach agree that what is needed now is the establishment of forums provided for in the Good Friday Agreement?  I refer to the all-Ireland consultative civic forum and the all-Ireland interparliamentary forum.  Does he agree that their establishment is long overdue nearly a decade after the agreement?  Will he wind up the forum provided for in the Estimates and press for the setting up of these bodies with the appropriate funding to carry out their functions?</p>
            <p eId="para_82">The second matter was previously raised by Deputy Gilmore regarding the funding available for the commemoration.  I do not think it is appropriate to do justice to one of the big commemorations which the State should be holding this year, which is the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.  That was one of the most influential organisations, not only in Ireland, but also in the US and Canada.  It was very much to the fore in Ireland's political, cultural and military history.  Is the Government planning to mark that anniversary on 17 March with an appropriate commemoration?</p>

            <p eId="para_83">There is a nominal figure put in for some of these subheads that are coming to the end of their natural life.  The subheads are kept in the Estimates process for a while because if they are closed, they cannot be paid.  Therefore, these small nominal amounts are put in for technical financial reasons until it is quite clear that the subhead is defunct.  No activity is envisaged for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is under subhead J.  There is also a nominal amount for the commission of investigation in case it is required, but there is no plan that it would be required.  It will fall off the list in a year or two.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">The procedure for commemorations is that a certain amount of money is put in under the Estimates and the Department tries to get approval for it.  Then it is open to organisations that are having commemorative events every year.  They are usually very well organised, like the flight of the earls group, which ran activities throughout many parts of the country, culminating in a function in Dublin Castle back in November.  Groups submit their plans in order to obtain resources under the subhead, so it is not based on what the Government is commemorating.  It is just used to assist organisations that are also involved in fundraising to obtain resources.  There are not many new commemorations this year.  There is a stamp commemoration which takes anniversaries of historical occasions into account, but that is separate and is carried out by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">In the past the State funded and ran groups such as the 1798 committee.  That committee was set up in the Department of An Taoiseach and it worked very well.  The same process occurred when commemorating the Famine.  I thought the Department would have set up some type of commemorative event or at least mark the occasion of the founding of the IRB.  Is there any person within the Department who looks at future events which the State should commemorate?  The State should do this, rather than always depend on small, underfunded groups to come up with initiatives.</p>

Obviously there are people in my Department already engaged in activity for 2016.  A cross-departmental group is being co-ordinated by my own officials, who also helped out the group commemorating Admiral Brown.  Every year a number of smaller groups look for grants.  To the best of my knowledge, the flight of the earls commemoration does not end until the summer and my officials are involved in that and in commemorating 2016.  I do not think there is any other event, but I am subject to correction.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">The Taoiseach spoke about the flight of the earls, but is he aware of the flight of the farmers from the land of Ireland?  I have a question on the proposed legislation on holding a referendum on the Lisbon treaty and the possible timing of this referendum.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the serious concerns expressed by the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association about World Trade Organisation, WTO, talks regarding possible concessions the EU Trade Commissioner is making, for which he has no mandate?  Has he, as Taoiseach, sought binding assurances from Commission President José Manuel Barroso that Commissioner Mandelson cannot go beyond the mandate that was confirmed at the EU Council of Ministers in October 2005?  I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, in defending Irish agriculture, but the Taoiseach must now row in behind the farmers because they are increasingly concerned that too much of our economy has been lost to European bureaucrats.  They will need strong reassurances before acceding to the referendum on the reform treaty.  This is a very important matter that I hope the Taoiseach will defend to the best of his ability and support the Minister for Agriculture and Food in trying to have a proper deal in place before the referendum.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">This is an important issue and I agree with Deputy Sheehan.  The mandate of the European Union as enunciated a few years ago is one I have defended all the way through.  Deputy Sheehan is referring to the efforts now being made as regards the WTO talks.  It appears that attempts will be made to have movement on this over the spring period.  It will be about the fourth or fifth time Commissioner Mandelson and others will have tried this, and they are making serious efforts again.  It creates risks for Ireland every time this round of negotiations comes up.  We shall do everything possible, both on the trade side and the agricultural side.  Most of this business is now concentrated on the trade side and a majority of countries negotiate under this forum rather than on the agricultural side, which always creates a problem for Ireland.  However, we shall continue to fight our corner to the best of our ability.</p>

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU, in particular, has a comprehensive plan for Liberty Hall, one of the most important sites relating to 1916.  The ICTU has a project in train as regards rebuilding Liberty Hall, while keeping the cultural and artistic centre it opened a number of years ago.  That project is being looked at and the film will be the easy part.  The overall plan will be more difficult.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">Deputies are probably aware that it is unlikely there will be a resolution of the immigration issue in the US before the presidential election.  All of the main players and all our supporters in both Houses of Congress have made that clear to us since last year.  We were very disappointed that efforts by the US Congress to pass the comprehensive reform legislation were unsuccessful, because we had put a good deal of effort into that, as had Members on all sides of this House.  However, we are continuing to explore bilateral options to regularise the status of the majority of the thousands of undocumented Irish, particularly those who have been in the US for many years, and to put in place an ordered system of legal migration from Ireland to the United States.  We have engaged in wide-ranging consultation with members of Congress, the US Administration and the Irish community there, to assess how this might be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">There are strong differences of opinion, even among our supporters and people who have been very helpful to us over the years.  I believe many people have been persuaded of the need to provide future opportunities for Irish people to work and travel in the US, which would also be open to the undocumented.  However, it will be extremely difficult to secure such an arrangement, given the nature of the immigration debate in Washington.  For obvious reasons that are not Irish-related, this is a passionate and divisive debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The Dáil agreed a motion last November supporting efforts to establish reciprocal bilateral arrangements which would benefit Irish and American citizens seeking to work and travel between and within the two countries, and reiterating our strong commitments to continuing engagement towards resolving the difficulties being experienced by the undocumented.  This will be the third year in which most of my time with the leaders in both the House of Representatives and on Capitol Hill will have been taken up on this issue, in an effort to tease out the difficulties.  There is a strong sense in Washington that immigration reform will remain a difficult issue for the foreseeable future.  While US political leaders fully acknowledge that the number of undocumented Irish is extremely small in the overall context, there is an understandable reluctance to single out one particular group for preferential treatment, and therein lies the difficulty.  I do not believe anyone is against our cause, but when taken in its totality they cannot deal with it.  We will, of course, continue our efforts for as long as it takes, and I shall certainly work on it again next month at the meetings that I will have.  The Deputy mentioned many other issues.  It is a matter of trying to raise these issues within the time available but the economy, immigration, the North, Europe and issues relating to climate change policies in Europe are the issues I hope to focus on.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_110">I am glad the Taoiseach is taking this issue very seriously.  When he goes to America and addresses both Houses of Congress it is important that he refers to the undocumented Irish, given that in the past month a young person from our country who was sick with pneumonia could not go to the authorities or the hospitals because he was afraid he would be identified and sent home.  He was sent home but the problem was he came home in a coffin.  That is sad.  These are our citizens whom we must protect.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The caucuses are taking place in relation to the presidential election but the only person who is talking about immigration is John McCain.  The Irish-American politicians over here addressed this House and told the Taoiseach and me what they would do for the Irish, yet when they have an opportunity now they do not appear to be too worried about the undocumented or about Ireland.  It is important that the Taoiseach goes out there and ensures we get the bilateral agreement.  As he has said, the numbers are small.  Why then can we not do a deal between ourselves and America?</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Given that there are American citizens in Ireland who are in the same position as our citizens in America, I do not know why we cannot do a deal.  Is Senator Ted Kennedy on board in regard to our undocumented?  The Taoiseach had discussions with him and, perhaps, he will tell the House if Senator Kennedy supports our case and what can be done to get this bilateral agreement.  As the Taoiseach has said, this House passed an agreed joint motion that we try to do something for the undocumented.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">The Deputy and I have the same end result in mind in this regard.  Two years ago I looked very closely at the models where there are bilateral agreements in other countries.  Many of the bilateral agreements that could be used would not help many of the old cases.  That is the problem.  One could get a bilateral agreement like the Australian one for young people, with a certain number of visas or permits per year but that would not do anything for the old cases and would not solve our problem.  The support for Ireland on this issue is strong.  Senator Clinton, Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy and others are strong supporters.  For understandable reasons, and I understand them totally, all of them had to get off the bus on this issue last year and nobody more so than Senator John McCain.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">Senator John McCain took a very forward view but he had to reverse at high speed and I understand why.  I think, however, at another time he will come back as a supporter.  What we have to do here in a political way is to work as best we can on our friends on the Hill because there is no chance of getting this together if we do not have Republicans and Democrats on our side.  We need both and we have to continue to nurture both sides to win support.  The Kennedy-McCain relationship almost worked — it was a pity it did not — but we will have to come back on that.  We all know the game and I am afraid the game will not resume until next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">The Deputy is referring to the arrangements we have for citizens who emigrate.  That is a major issue.  The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment work closely on that issue.  We have the green card here for people coming in who are required in various professions and businesses.  We have a liberal regime on that but on other sides there are other difficulties and issues.  The new immigration Bill is one of the more important Bills to come before the House this year because of the huge number of loopholes and areas that have to be dealt with in the legislation that we never had before.  We have been working on immigration legislation since 1935 and a number of amendments have been made since then.  I will give three examples.  There is a huge Chinese community here.  All the issues relating to education, English language training, visas and permits have to be tidied up.  We have a sizeable Brazilian community but they are not covered by any of the regulations.  The legislation also must address bogus marriages which, let us be honest about it, is a major problem.  They come from a range of nationalities.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_65">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_118">I wish to ask three questions.  I am acutely aware of the complexity of the whole immigration business and agree it will not be possible to address it unless there is all-round agreement on both sides.  I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 29 January, in which he said that on the ground in Washington on a daily basis the ambassador and the personnel there are in discussion with Congressional members, Senator Schumer, Kennedy and so on, in respect of arrangements for a bilateral agreement, following the unanimous decision of the Dáil.  I understand the difficulties associated with that.  In regard to the bilateral proposal being followed through by the Government here, is that a bilateral agreement on the basis of all Ireland, North and South, because obviously the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly are interested in this also?  If one follows through the bilateral agreement it should be on an island basis because the next 25 to 50 years will require that type of linkage both ways, to the island of Ireland and the US, if we are to compete with the challenges from other locations around the world and keep that flexibility of Ireland and America alive.  Is it being followed on that basis?</p>
            <p eId="para_119">I appreciate that the Government and the Department make money available to some extent for looking after Irish people in the US.  I make a plea to the Taoiseach to look particularly at the elderly Irish who live in some of the major cities such as New York and other locations where they find themselves in fixed rented accommodation for a long period.  Many of these tenement quarters have been taken over by particular nationalities.  In the middle of all this there may well be an elderly Irish person who is isolated, lonely and alone but looked after to some extent by the voluntary organisations there.  These organisations have a database available and they make good use of the money the Government makes available to them.  In his address to both Houses I ask him to recall these people who worked hard when times were difficult and played their part in building up the economy of the United States.  We should try not to forget them in that context.  I appreciate the fact that money is given but whether it is spent to best effect is the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">Given the economic challenges the world faces and that we as a consequence face, I ask the Taoiseach to look at the question of closer relationships with universities, technological centres and business in the US.  I welcome yesterday's announcement in respect of Shannon.  Our university sector, our institute of technology sector and our business sector need to develop stronger linkages with those sectors in the US, out of which will come new research and development and new jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">It is fair to say the Taoiseach will have an opportunity when he addresses the joint Congress later this year to speak to America at an opportune time.  I note that in the Taoiseach's earlier reply to Deputy Gilmore he stated he will be devoting a portion of his address to the US Congress to the issue of economic affairs.  In the course of that address, will the Taoiseach highlight the importance of US-based multinational jobs in this country, as I am sure he will?  At the last US presidential election, the then Democratic candidate, Senator Kerry, proposed a new taxing regime for US-owned companies outside the US, which would have had a very detrimental effect on US business in Ireland.  I ask the Taoiseach to highlight the importance of US investment in this country in the course of his speech because the two great parties of America, the Republicans and the Democrats, will be finalising their platforms from April onwards and it is important to stress the importance of that investment to a small, open economy such as Ireland's.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I agree with Deputy Kenny on immigration.  It is a matter of trying to work our way through the issue and reach agreement.  While I see the sense of the Deputy's point on the North, I am not sure of the legal issue or what that would open up to the other citizens of the UK if we were to reach a bilateral agreement as it would be open to anyone in the UK.  Nonetheless, I take the point and will raise the matter with those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">With regard to the welfare organisations, between the UK and the USA we are, thankfully, investing a substantial amount of money.  The Deputy's point is that we should focus that investment on the older Irish.  The DÍON grants are doing a good job in that regard in the UK and that money is now being used to lever further funding through UK local and municipal authorities to help with housing trusts and funds.  It is doing good work and is certainly beneficial to the aged Irish there.  We have also directly helped some of the centres which work in the community, operate meals on wheels schemes and help the elderly Irish in the UK.  This operates a little differently in the USA, but I will raise the point with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">Deputy Hayes is correct with regard to investment.  We had more than one week of anguish on that proposal four years ago because Senator Kerry made a very strong point and, as the House will recall, we were on high alert to lobby against that.  There have been renewed soundings in this regard and we have been watching the situation carefully.  We will obviously lobby on the issues.  Of course this sounds a very attractive policy from the US perspective.  The good news is that many of the multinational companies are not in favour and so will also be lobbying against it.  However, it is an issue on which we will closely focus and we will work to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">Overall, we will do everything we can to keep our contacts bipartisan.  It will obviously be a difficult year but it is in our interest to remain supportive of both the parties in the US.  While there will be a winner and a loser in the presidential election, in terms of how things operate on the Hill, particularly in the Senate, nothing will get done unless we have both of them on our side.  We learned that with regard to the immigration issue but on many other issues we need friends on both sides to get things done.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I recognise that on occasion there is a requirement for a Minister to attend abroad on international business or otherwise.  This may well require that while the Minister attends, a Deputy fills in for him or her at Question Time.  However, it appears quite a number of claims for rotation of parliamentary questions are being made.  This is only a six-week session.  While I understand this issue may arise on occasion, I ask the Chief Whip if it is possible to have some sense of stability in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">I am not objecting to the arrangement.  For our part, we understand there must be some flexibility.  However, I would not like a situation where every week it appears that some Minister of the Government parties wants to swap questions, which means that Opposition spokespersons must make arrangements to comply or be faced with dealing with Ministers of State.  In planning ahead on these matters, and as this is only a six or seven-week session, it should not be necessary to have a question every week regarding approval for rotation of parliamentary questions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_134">I also want to put down a marker in this regard.  The proposal before us today is the third change in the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions since we came back last week.  This used to be a very rare occasion and it was something the Opposition parties and spokespersons were quite happy to accommodate.  If a Minister is away on important official business on behalf of the country, that would be accommodated.  However, it is becoming part of a pattern whereby Ministers want to be anywhere except in the House.  It is going on all the time.  Ministerial questions are changed and important debates take place in the House while the relevant Minister is abroad.  Rarely now does a Minister come to the House to take the Adjournment debate for which they have direct responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">This is not something we can continue to allow.  The sitting year is a short one.  Ministers should be able, by and large, to organise their diaries and visits abroad or business of that kind in such a way that they are present in the House to deal with business and account to the House.  Within that framework, we can accommodate the odd occasion when something major arises that requires a Minister to be abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">I give notice that this is not something we will allow to go without debate in future if the pattern continues.  Labour party spokespersons marking the different Ministers will not as readily agree to these arrangements as heretofore.</p>

The questions refer specifically to the Minister for Transport.  One concerned a train that went to Limerick with one passenger on board and which obviously had no communications system to make contact with the driver.

There is already a Lisbon strategy and a Lisbon Agenda, and now we have a Lisbon treaty.  There is a considerable amount of confusion about the issue.  I suggest the appropriate title should be the Lisbon reform treaty.  It was developed as a reform treaty and signed in Lisbon, so effectively that is the correct title.  Perhaps that title could be agreed in the context of the proposed legislation, in consultation with the National Forum on Europe and the Committee on European Affairs.

When the Taoiseach meets the Prime Minister Gordon Brown at the end of the week, I wonder whether he will raise with him the refusal of the British ambassador to Ireland to engage in normal industrial relations practices by declining an invitation to the Labour Relations Commission regarding a dispute.  In the context of the Good Friday Agreement such participation by an employer would be reasonable, good neighbourly behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Second, I welcome the Student Support Bill, which was published yesterday.  Will the Chief Whip ensure the normal convention of a two-week period of reflection takes place before Second Stage commences?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I refer to the issue raised by my colleague, Deputy Durkan.  Every day the Ceann Comhairle's office issues a sackful of letters to Members, three of which landed on my desk earlier from the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport indicating a total abdication of responsibility on their part.  I seek the Ceann Comhairle's guidance.  Where can we obtain the information if it is not forthcoming from the Minister in charge, especially having regard to the time honoured tradition of Minister's questions?  For example, I asked about the number of people who have received custodial sentences for failure to pay a civil debt; the steps the Minister for Transport will take to relieve waiting lists for driving tests in Portlaoise, a perfectly justifiable and reasonable question for a Deputy to ask; the number of special exemption orders granted by the courts to publications; the number of persons serving life imprisonment; and the average terms of custody for those serving a life sentence.  I do not know nor have I way of finding out.  Will the Ceann Comhairle's office consider contacting the quangos that have been given responsibility for dealing with these issues?  Rather than sending letters directly to Deputies, a system might be set in train to allow for the reply to be forthcoming if the relevant Minister is not prepared to come into the House.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_223">I refer to the measures proposed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in the context of the challenges facing the economy.  Today's newspapers highlight a report by NCB stockbrokers, which states growth in the service industry slowed to a four-year low in January, the level of new exports among new service providers fell for the first time in 53 months in January and business confidence levels are well below last year's averages.  Consumer confidence also fell by one third over the past 12 months.  Yesterday €4 billion was wiped off the value of Irish shares, with banks and the construction sector particularly affected.  The biggest task the Tánaiste will face over the next year is managing the difficulties in the economy, yet the Finance Bill is rudderless in that area.  It is easy for a Government to manage during good times but it is much more difficult to do so in bad times when leadership is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It is often said that the Opposition does not provide strategies for the future but I have some simple suggestions that the Government should implement as a matter of urgency to deal with the difficulties we are facing.  The Tánaiste's main objective should be restoring confidence in the economy by improving competitiveness.  In the contribution he made yesterday, he stated that Ireland's inflation rate was slightly above the EU average.  Rather than be happy with that, he should try to bring inflation below the EU average.  The Government must make a commitment to keep price increases in the areas it regulates below the rate of inflation.  The national programme to restore competitiveness recommended by the National Competitiveness Council in its recently published 2007 annual report should be established immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">With the national pay negotiations about to commence, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should not lecture ordinary workers on pay restraint given their own exorbitant pay increases.  The Tánaiste will receive an increase of the order of €36,500, which is more than the average industrial wage.  It would appear that he is the highest paid Minister for Finance in the world, even though we are one of the smallest economies.  The Taoiseach will receive a salary of approximately ten times the average industrial wage.  In line with the proposal made yesterday by Deputy Mansergh, I ask the Government to decouple remunerations for senior civil servants from the private sector.  Furthermore, I urge Ministers to refuse the pay increases recommended by the higher remuneration group.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The Government must develop a balanced business economy.  We have been too reliant on the construction sector, which produces 15% of tax revenues and accounts for 25% of GNP.  The Government stands indicted — when we joined the euro and interest rates fell that encouraged people to take out loans and resulted in an unsustainable situation whereby 90,000 houses were completed annually.  The bubble has now burst, prices are falling by approximately 20% and many young people are facing negative equity.  I welcome the proposed provisions on stamp duty but they are being introduced too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">This is a small and open economy, so we must return to basics.  We clearly need a construction sector but it must be sustainable.  We have lost 30,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector since 2001, while the construction sector experienced a similar increase in employment.  We need sustainable manufacturing, service and construction sectors, as well as sustainable foreign direct investment.  We need to take a balanced approach by increasing exports of goods and services by 20%.  In 2006, the increase was only 4% and the Central Bank is now projecting a mere6%. In January, growth in services slowed to a four year low and new exports by Irish service providers fell for the first time in 53 months.  We must reverse that decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The case could be made for the Tánaiste to revise his budget projections.  He based his construction figures on 55,000 house completions but the Construction Industry Federation is now projecting 30,000 completions.  Ten thousand completions are equivalent to 1% growth and €1 billion in tax revenue, so 30,000 houses would represent a shortfall of €2 billion and a €7 billion Exchequer deficit.  That could push us close to the 3% limit under the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is important, therefore, that the Tánaiste introduce measures to enhance competitiveness in other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">A 2% efficiency drive in the public sector would have yielded €3 billion per year for frontline services.  I note that the level of expenditure for public services in January was 20% greater than last year's figure.  Unless the public sector is properly reformed, I question whether the Government can hold to its expected 9.3% increase in deadlines.  There has been significant wastage over the past number of years.  Approximately €420 million has been spent on e-government, even though some projects have never been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">A structured review of EU directives is required to determine how Ireland can maximise the benefits from them.  The climate change strategy must be implemented as a matter of urgency instead of bringing in VRT and motor tax on cars and accelerated capital allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">In regard to my constituency of Limerick East, I welcome the proposals made by the Tánaiste on regenerating Limerick.  I look forward to seeing the measures being introduced because they will be extremely important for the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The budget provides for a 12.5% tax on foreign dividends on holding companies based in Ireland.  An immediate measure to enhance competitiveness would be to exempt such companies.  We are competing with countries such as Holland to attract worldwide companies to locate their headquarters in Ireland and we must regain our comparative advantage in order to sustain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The role of a Minister is to look after jobs and the most vulnerable people in society.  Success in that regard requires a vibrant and open economy rather than over-reliance on the construction sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_234">I welcome several of the initiatives set out in the Finance Bill.  The first matter to which I wish to refer is the green element of the Bill and the provisions relating to improving the environment.  We have employed various incentives and educational and other methods to try to encourage people to change their ways regarding refuse and the dumping thereof.  I drove through various parts of my constituency on Monday last and observed that the quality of the grass on the verges at the sides of the roads has deteriorated as a result of the amount of rubbish being dumped there in plastic bags etc.  The Finance Bill contains a number of tax incentives to encourage people to be more concerned about the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">We have done a great deal in the context of issuing information regarding refuse, the dumping of rubbish and so forth but we have not been too successful.  Providing incentives is the only way to ensure an improved and greener environment in the future.  Officials from local authorities are charged with checking on the dumping of rubbish but the practice remains ongoing.  Cork County Council has done great work on putting in place bring centres etc.  However, careful consideration must be given to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">My second point relates to section 20 of the Bill, which contains incentives in respect of farm partnerships.  In the past 15 years, particularly in the context of the dairy sector, the farm partnership model was used to try to amalgamate smaller farms into single units.  Some of these partnerships did not work or fell apart, for example as a result of the death of one of their members.  I welcome the provisions on farm partnerships and I hope they will be implemented because many people, through no specific fault of their own, were affected when certain partnerships fell apart.  I am glad the Government is taking action in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Another issue to which I wish to refer is the giving of sites to family members by either a father or mother.  The threshold in this regard is being increased dramatically, which is welcome.  It is fine to ensure that sites can be transferred without incurring stamp duty payments and so forth.  However, major issues arise in the context of rural planning and further such issues will come to light in the future in respect of the regulations that are to be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">On the subject of sites, a farmer in my constituency wished to transfer ownership of a site to a school which had received a grant from the Department of Education and Science under the devolved grants scheme to build an extension.  The individual in question wanted to give, free of charge, an acre of land to the school.  In view of the prices charged for land, particularly in villages and towns, it is amazing that he was willing to donate the site.  However, as a result of the regulations on taxation and stamp duty, the farmer in question could not transfer the land in the free and simple way he envisaged because a monetary value had to be placed on it.  In addition, and even though there would not have been any exchange of funds in respect of the site, stamp duty would have had to be paid.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter, particularly because many people are willing to donate small parcels of land to community projects, etc.  Perhaps an amendment could be introduced in respect of this matter and people throughout the country might benefit as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">In recent years a great deal of effort and money have been invested in promoting agriculture.  Some of the provisions in this regard in both the budget and the Finance Bill are welcome.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has made available huge grants in respect of farm pollution and the protection of the environment and it is examining the possibility of expanding these because they have been of major benefit to people in rural areas, particularly those on smaller incomes, in the context of allowing them to put in place the proper facilities to ensure that the environment is protected from an agricultural point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance made provision in the budget for a once-off grant for St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which is the service provider for people with intellectual disabilities in north Cork and south Limerick.  It offers a fantastic service and I cannot praise highly enough its chairman, Martin O'Donnell, its chief executive, Conor Counihan, and its staff for the work they do.  The foundation is seen as one of the best service providers in the entire country and it does fantastic work.  The funding provided is welcome, particularly in light of the huge shortfall relating to the hydrotherapy pool the foundation built for those who avail of its service.  It is great that the Government is giving recognition to those employed by the foundation who do tremendous work in their communities in providing help not only to the service users but also to their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">If I commented at length on the health sector, we could be here <i>saecula saeculorum</i>.  Huge amounts of money have been included under the health service budget.  There are a number of issues that arise from time to time, particularly in the context of the assessment of home helps.  If a person is admitted to hospital for a week or ten days, when he or she returns home it will be almost three weeks before their home help service resumes.  This only adds to the paperwork officials are obliged to complete.  If a person is entitled to the services of a home help before he or she enters hospital, either for a routine stay or as a result of an emergency, surely he or she should be able to avail of those services again immediately upon his or her return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Consideration must be given to this matter because the home help service provides an excellent service and allows people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  It provides support for families throughout the country and is a great initiative.  Ten or 15 years ago, such a service was not available.  Instead of being cut back, it should be enhanced in every way.  We must ensure that the type of bureaucracy to which I refer is removed from the equation because it is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I wish to comment on the major resistance in Dublin to the decentralisation project and the transfer of parts of Departments or State agencies to locations throughout the country.  Decentralisation is welcome because we need more balanced views rather than having everything centred on Dublin.  The ideas and views contained in reports compiled from people in other parts of the country must be brought to the attention of central Government.  I am glad the decentralisation programme is proceeding and I look forward to the fulfilment of the commitments made in respect of the towns of Macroom and Kanturk in my constituency.  Decentralisation is a great project and it has benefited many people in various communities.  There is no reason work cannot be done as well or better in locations other than Dublin.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs, I welcome the review taking place in the Department of the Taoiseach of the regulatory affairs bodies set up around the country.  In that context, the committee now has powers to investigate the set-up, finances and operations of regulators in their reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That should be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Every public representative could comment on the amount of regulation that has come about in the setting up or carrying out of business, which has hampered such businesses across the country.  There is a thought among the public and abroad that we interpret our regulations far more strictly in this country than elsewhere.  This is particularly so in considering how regulations are implemented in other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I welcome the review being made by the Taoiseach's Department but as a Government and Parliament as a whole, we must consider this matter seriously.  We must ensure no industry — small, medium or large business — or other group of people will be hampered by regulation going forward.  There should be a clear method and system within the country that will minimise regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I would be the first to admit that, in some sectors, stringent regulations had to be introduced.  In some cases, regulations are very worthwhile in the carrying on of businesses and saving lives in the case of the Health and Safety Authority.  However, we have come from a position of little regulation to one with significant regulation, so it is important we get the balance right.  I will consider the matter in committee and we will try to ensure the committee's work leads to regulation being limited unless it is worthwhile and benefits society.  If there is a surplus of regulation, we will try to look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I will also address the issue of infrastructure, particularly the amount of money which has been pumped in by the Government to roads, leading to upgrades of the main motorways and dual carriageways between cities.  That is continuing and I am delighted the Atlantic corridor from Cork to Limerick and Galway is a priority under Transport 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Some towns are experiencing significant bottlenecks.  Kildare and Monasterevin were very problematic for people driving from Cork or anywhere else on the N7 to Dublin ten years ago.  Those towns have now been bypassed but the problems are further down the line.  We have significant problems in places such as Charleville in north Cork and Buttevant.  Funding has again been committed this year and I hope these projects will move on.  Charleville in particular is clogged on a Friday from 3 p.m. until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and right throughout the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Much industry has started up in the area over the past three or four years and much employment is coming on stream.  A new hotel opened recently, which should be welcomed.  The only way we can ensure continued growth in towns clogged by traffic is to continue funding from the Government in the form of the Transport 21 programme.  It should be front-loaded because at times when economic difficulties are apparent, there can be a tightening of funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">There may be an inclination to cut these projects but it is important we continue to spend money on them to ensure we have the best possible road infrastructure to attract inward investment.  As we have been attracting inward investment for some time, it is most important we ensure the investment, jobs and employment we have are supported.  This also applies to the entrepreneurs and businesspeople running indigenous industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Others have spoken about competitiveness, an economic issue which the Government should look at carefully.  We have a buoyant economy which we hope to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The Minister has tried to bring in some incentives with the Finance Bill but there are significant untapped resources in our country.  Many businesspeople have been good at developing industry, getting a bright idea and being forward thinking.  Ballyhass Lakes in north Cork is an example, as much industry has been developed around a tourist attraction.  That should be welcomed.  We must ensure we have proper taxation incentives and encouragement from local Leader groups and enterprise boards so these people will continue to consider ideas and others will be encouraged in every possible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Over the years people criticised local authorities and Leader groups but the local Leader groups are doing fantastic work right across the country and should be encouraged.  We are hoping for further funding under the Leader projects from the Department headed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I hope this will come sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">These groups have provided funding and encouragement to local people right across the country.  They have been the first port of call for businesses and people looking at opportunities.  They have provided advice and incentives.  Related to my point on decentralisation, these people are already on the ground and can readily identify with an area or group of people in terms of providing encouragement.  They have the benefit of being located within the local community and therefore know exactly what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Some of the groups are working with local community activists in the setting up of plans for villages and towns.  These incentives should have been in place long ago and I am delighted they are finally being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I have some comments on how the budget and Finance Bill relate to people caring for others at home, be they elderly parents, siblings, sons and daughters or people with disabilities.  All Members would state these people carry out significant work in society.  The half-way carer's allowance was introduced in September 2007, which provided that anybody on a qualifying social welfare payment — a pension or disability allowance, although not the jobseeker's allowance — could get an allowance.  That has alleviated significant concern and poverty for people in their homes.  People who qualified for it have been absolutely delighted to get it.  It was a great initiative which got many people out of financial difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Much funding has been put into the education sector, particularly the construction and renovation of primary schools over the years with the devolved grant.  This grant has brought much benefit and allowed the boards of management of local schools incentives to get jobs done at a very competitive and reasonable price.  The old scheme dealt with major refurbishments and we can see the cost differences for the Exchequer have been significant.  I encourage the Department to carry on this fantastic work.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">With these comments I commend the Finance Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister for Finance on an excellent Bill.  There is much in the Bill that will be of great importance.  The consolidation of farms was introduced and approved by the European Commission.  Officials at the Department of Finance should consider including provisions on farmers who sold two farms to buy one, by way of amendment on either Committee or Report Stages.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I wish to share time with Deputy Terence Flanagan.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  Although the Bill has a green tinge it represents another missed opportunity on the Government's part to address Ireland's deteriorating competitiveness.  It fails to address some of the key problems facing our economy and to heed warnings, including those from the Central Bank, that growth will halve this year.  The housing market is edgy, the latest information shows that prices fell by 7.3% in 2007 and a further drop of 5% is forecast for this year.  The numbers on the live register are expected to rise by 26,000 due to the slowing of the economy.  The numbers in work are set to grow by only 0.8% with spending to increase by only 1.5%.  Faced with these challenges this Finance Bill lacks imagination.  Investors looking to Ireland need reassurance but the Government is failing to take heed of the changed economic climate and to put in place any ideas to cushion the country during this bumpy period.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">According to one of the national newspapers yesterday the Health Service Executive, HSE, is to receive approximately €370 million less in Government funding this year.  This is not enough to sustain the level of our health service.  As a Deputy from County Clare I am concerned about the implications this shortfall would have for the hospital in Ennis which is already facing serious challenges as revealed late last year following HSE cutbacks.  Ennis General Hospital faces a shortfall of €3.5 million in 2008.  Last week I read in another newspaper that the HSE in the north west drafted a list of cost saving proposals which would reduce the delivery of services.  Will the Minister of State ask the Ministers for Finance and for Health and Children whether the services at Ennis hospital will be further reduced following the cut in funding for the HSE?</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The uncertainty around the redevelopment of the hospital causes serious concerns.  When will the proposed €30 million worth of work commence there?  It is already behind schedule and I understand that work on the planning process has not progressed because of last year's budget shortfall.  My constituents will suffer if there is no proper health service in the county.  Health services must be patient-centred but if the Government fails to provide sufficient funding for the HSE or the HSE has to trim its budgets patients will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The funding arrangements for Clare County Council are inadequate to deliver basic services especially in respect of water and sewerage.  No sewerage system has been started in Clare in the past five years.  There was good news for Feakle and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, in his former role in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government visited Clare several times to examine these schemes.  Work has commenced in Feakle and Mullagh and is about to commence in Scariff but there are problems there too.  The schemes have been cut back and areas just outside the towns have not been included.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have to face up to these problems particularly in Ennis when the schemes commence.  Only last week Clare County Council avoided being axed when it accepted a revised budget as a result of the shortfall in funding from the Department.  I have tabled a question for the Minister urging him to meet the council officials, councillors and Oireachtas Members to consider the shortfall in the council's budget.  If he has extra money in the water service budget, which runs to approximately €24 million, he should allocate some of it to Clare County Council particularly to deal with the crisis regarding the water filtration problem in Ennis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was also aware of the inadequate temporary supply in his former capacity.  I hope the Minister will see fit to meet the delegation as I suggest in my parliamentary question.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">Clare County Council received €15.6 million whereas other county councils received more, for example Laois, €18.3 million and Waterford almost €23 million, which shows that Ministers are delivering to their own counties.  I do not wish to say anything about the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, at this stage but let us hope that he will deliver to Clare in future budgets.  Clare was sixth from the bottom in the Department of Finance's funding league.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Bill also falls short in respect of Shannon Airport.  Over the past 18 months I have heard many statements from Ministers for Transport about a major tourism and economic plan for the region to cushion the blow from the introduction of open skies.  The region has a history of innovation and with the proper Government support can play a pivotal role in its development.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, admitted in an interview on local radio last week that there was nothing new in the plan announced then but that it was a restatement of commitments already announced.  The plan is about as exciting as a reheated lunch.  It offers nothing and lacks imagination.  Much of the money the Minister allocated had already been allocated in the budget in 2008 and it falls well short of the €53 million envisaged by the mid-west regional authority.  The Government has failed the mid-west.  It ran away from the problem caused by the ending of the Shannon-Heathrow service last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The delays in the construction of the extension of the US customs and border protection facility at the airport should be resolved as quickly as possible.  I welcome the announcement yesterday by Zimmer of 250 jobs for the region over the next two years, and its €50 million investment.  The Shannon duty free zone has been crying out for investment for many years.  The good news however should not deflect from the serious blows to the area in recent months.  Jobs were lost at John Crane, Aer Lingus, Tyco Electronics and yesterday Shannon Community Group closed with a loss of 22 full-time jobs for people with special needs.  I hope those jobs can be reinstated in another area because these people find it hard to get jobs.  I would like to see the development of more new companies throughout the county, particularly in my area, west Clare where it could play a major role in sustaining rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The provisions of the Finance Bill do not go far enough in extending tax credits for research and development.  It does not introduce the necessary measures to enhance Ireland's position as a destination for foreign direct investment.  I urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance to rethink and address these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I refer to the issue of schools, for which funding is completely inadequate.  I welcome the announcement last week by the Minister for Education and Science on funding to Ballyea national school in Ennis, County Clare.  Although Government Deputies will disagree, as an Opposition Deputy I played a role in embarrassing the Minister into delivering on this project.  However, other schools throughout the county have infrastructural problems including St. Michael's community college in Kilmihil and the primary school at Inch, which awaits an extension.  Moreover, three schools in Ennistymon are awaiting the go-ahead for amalgamation.  The provision of education for young people constitutes a test of the Government, which it has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I pay tribute to a great visionary, Dr. Brendan O'Regan, who died last week.  Given the challenges the economy faces, we need a vision for the future and it is up to the Government to provide it.  While Fine Gael also will provide vision, urgent investment is required in roads, railways, airports and sewerage schemes, as well as the infrastructure for towns and villages.  The Finance Bill is a major disappointment.  The Government has no long-term vision, lacks imagination and has passed its sell-by date.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_274">I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  Budget 2008 was one of the most disappointing budgets of the past ten years.  There is a lack of investment in education, health, transport and the social economy.  The Minister for Finance was happier to take the easy option than to drive change in budget 2008.  It represented a test of leadership Deputy Brian Cowen has failed.  Ordinary families and small businesses will pay for the incompetent mismanagement of the public purse that Members have witnessed in the past ten years.  I refer to the hypocrisy of pre-election promises made by the Government on tax cutting, when voters were grossly misled on the state of the economy in the recent general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">However, since last summer the Minister for Finance spoke about delivering a tight budget.  He tried strenuously to dampen down expectations created by his own party, with its unrealisable pre-election promises.  In advance of the election, Fianna Fáil promised 2,000 additional gardaí, 4,000 additional teachers, 1,500 additional hospital beds, 2,000 additional consultants, tax cuts, PRSI cuts, affordable housing and much more.  The deceit on which the election was won, which was a carbon copy of the general election win of 2002, is clear for all to see.  Tax cutting proposals that were never viable have had to be abandoned in the face of a €2 billion shortfall in tax revenues.  Despite much talk about value for money, I note that the Finance Bill does not mention how to achieve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The budget was a bitter disappointment to those who were promised by the Government that more families would be entitled to the medical card.  In the programme for Government, Fianna Fáil promised to double the income limit eligibility for parents of children under six and treble it for parents of children with a disability.  However, Fianna Fáil has reneged on that commitment.  The Government could easily afford to extend the medical card scheme to all children under 18.  Low to middle income families again have been let down and continue to bear the brunt of inequity in the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">When one considers the past 10 years, one sees Fianna Fáil's record of broken promises, failed policies and missed opportunities.  Instead of using the benefits of recent wealth generation to help those most in need, the Fianna Fáil Government, with its recently-acquired partners in the Green Party, merely has ensured a continuation of health, education and other quality of life disparities between the haves and the have-nots.  While some have done well from a Government intent on promoting a culture of greed, l am confident the electorate will pass judgment when next afforded the opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Fine Gael will continue to campaign for and on behalf of local communities that have been ignored or treated with contempt by the Government.  We will stand up for those parents whose children are not being fully supported by the State.  Children are being ignored because they have special needs, which certainly is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Minister for Finance has turned a €2.3 billion Exchequer surplus into a €4.9 billion deficit because of the sloppy, self-indulgent and wasteful manner in which he has spent money for more than two years.  This constitutes the worst decline in Exchequer finances in the history of the State and must be debated.  How and why did this happen?  Although the Minister for Finance stated nine months ago that he would entirely wipe out Government debt, the Minister now intends to borrow €5 billion.  The increases in current and capital spending of €4 billion and €1billion, respectively, reveal the destination of that €5 billion in borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">While the stamp duty reform is welcome, it came nine months too late.  Since the Tánaiste introduced the budget last December, all the economic indicators have been revised downwards.  Much more difficult economic times certainly lie ahead.  Unemployment is increasing; Ireland is close to the top of the European inflation league and the property market, despite the Tánaiste's botched attempts at stamp duty reform, is flat and is not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Although Ireland has one of the highest levels of personal indebtedness in Europe, the Tánaiste continues to insist all is well.  I refer to another indicator with which the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is familiar.  In 2004, 134 summonses were issued by the courts for house repossession.  Last year, 465 summonses were issued, which constitutes an increase of 350%.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">The main domestic problem is the property market.  The fall in house prices over the past year has had a major knock-on impact on construction activity.  Employment in construction is falling and the live register is increasing.  Exchequer returns for January highlight the effect on stamp duty receipts, which are a major source of income for the Government.  They have halved, which constitutes a major problem.  The Government parties must be held accountable for their mismanagement of the property market.  They failed to control prices and, having overheated the market, were then directly responsible for the stamp duty debacle, which sent it plummeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">While house price moderation will be a welcome development for the many thousands who wish to purchase a home, there is a real danger that people who have bought a home in the past two years using 100% mortgages could find themselves in negative equity.  A rise in unemployment that was coupled with heavier debt burdens could increase the number of home repossessions in the coming years.  The number of repossessions has already trebled since 2004 according to figures supplied by the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Ireland also could be in line for serious home-grown sub-prime problems as those who over-stretched themselves with heavy mortgages during the boom times and who were helped by the financial institutions that the Minister did not bother to regulate before last Friday, face a harsher economic climate.  Young men in particular are at risk of falling into the unemployment trap unless clear pathways are outlined for them to acquire transferable skills.  There must be a significant focus on retraining and educational opportunities for such workers.</p>

If we are to regain competitiveness and provide the world-class infrastructure and public services the people deserve, continued investment is essential.  Our chronic traffic gridlock is simply one example of how the infrastructure deficit both curtails competitiveness and has a negative impact, which is often severe, on the quality of people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Higher hospital and drugs charges will take another €50 million out of the pockets of families.  As our health spokesperson has noted, the Minister for Health and Children has given up on the most vulnerable in society with her stealth taxes in accident and emergency units, hospital bed charges raised by 10% and the raising of the bar on drug refund schemes from €85 to €90 a month.  Her stubborn refusal to increase the income threshold for medical cards, which currently stands at €184 per week for a single person, which is €13.80 lower than the social welfare payment to a single person, means people who have the misfortune to earn more than half the minimum wage will still be denied a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The Government's neglect of mental health and suicide prevention measures was perpetuated by its failure to include these vital issues in its budget day announcements.<b> </b>One in four people will suffer from some form of psychiatric illness in his or her lifetime.  It is reported that 500 people take their own lives and 80,000 people attempt suicide or self-harm each year.  These grim facts appear to have escaped the Government’s attention as it outlined its spending plans for the year ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Sometimes when we are considering an important Bill such as this, we forget about its principal aims and refer to parish pumps and byroads.  It is no harm for us, therefore, to advert to the main aims of the Finance Bill 2008, as outlined by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  These include supporting enterprise and innovation, advancing sustainable development and ensuring a fairer tax system.  I am sure the public is very pleased that we have somebody in the finance portfolio who not only has a steady hand but also a cool head.  He does not listen to the rhetoric being expounded daily regarding intervention in the financial markets, not only in Ireland but internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I am glad the Minister is a man of competence who understands what markets are about.  He does not make loose statements or comments that will interfere with or do damage to Ireland internationally.  This was brought home to me in a very straightforward way last week when the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the chief executive of the Financial Regulator appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which I chair.  The clear message of these witnesses, who are independent of the Government, was that the measures taken and comments made by the Minister for Finance are to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">When we consider what is occurring internationally, we note the panic measures in the United States.  Most of the economic problems in the European Union and western world have surfaced on account of sub-prime lending in the United States.  We do not have a problem with sub-prime lending here, as announced by the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland last week.  He stated our financial institutions are not open to the problem.  It is very important that this is known and stated in this House, but it was not stated by the media.  The Governor stated that the measures taken in the budget and the facts that we have such high employment and are not open to the sub-prime lending problem in the United States are important to Ireland's financial stability.  We should base our statements today on this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Ireland is a small country with an open economy, and it galls me to realise people try to do it down in international finance houses.  This is the nearest thing to financial treason that one can get.  It is time for us to take a stand and state this country is sound.  It is sound on many footings, it has the second lowest debt ratio in the European Union, it has nearly full employment and, in the past ten years, it has had one of the highest growth rates in the western world.  These are the foundations on which the country is built.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">People comment on the slowdown in the construction of residential housing and suggest the whole world will fall down around the shoes of Ireland.  Construction accounts for 20% of our overall gross domestic product.  I refer to all commercial and residential development.  Is there anybody in this House who will tell me that construction in the commercial sector is slowing down?</p>

          <p eId="para_310">It is not where I come from in the midlands.  If anything, it is accelerating.  New house construction accounts for 13% of our gross domestic product.  Anybody with family or relatives buying a house will say it was inappropriate that house prices were increasing at a rate of 20% per year.  What was to happen to young people who wanted to get a house for themselves?  Prices were so high that they had no opportunity.  I welcome the slowdown in the increase in house prices, as do many around the country, including young people setting up home for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">In June 2006, the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland indicated that a readjustment was needed and confirmed to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week that it is now taking place.  These were his words and not those of the Minister for Finance or a political commentator.  I accept that there is obviously a fallout in terms of employment in the construction sector and there will probably be a consequent increase in unemployment.  The governor indicated that the number of unemployed could increase by 20,000 or 25,000 and that inflation may increase to 5%.  These are facts of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Let us consider the responses to economic conditions in the United States and the European Union.  I was in Brussels at a meeting on finance only a couple of weeks ago and there were individuals present who were pushing the president of the European Central Bank to respond to what was happening in the United States.  I am glad to say the president has a cool head, just like that of the Minister for Finance in Ireland.  The president said his first priority was to control inflation on behalf of the citizens of the European Union.  That is a good position to adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">In terms of support for enterprise and innovation, I welcome the proposed developments in Cork and Limerick.  However, I hope the Minister for Finance will address the matter of the proposed tax corridor for the lower Shannon region, which is not mentioned in the Bill.  I am a great supporter of this proposal, which was announced some months ago, and I hope it will be implemented.  It offers major advantages for counties Westmeath, Roscommon, Clare, Limerick and the entire Shannon region.  The opportunity is there, under this proposal, to offer a boost to tourism in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">It is sometimes forgotten in this debate that the Minister for Finance, in his budget, Book of Estimates and Finance Bill, has maintained the capital budget for infrastructural development.  This is particularly welcome.  In my county alone, €55 million has been allocated for national roads this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I understand a charities Bill is being drafted, but I am still not satisfied that we are up to speed with what is happening in other European countries in terms of offering incentives to those who wish to support charitable causes.  I ask that the Minister examine this issue.  There are wealthy people in this State who are prepared to offer their support.  I do not want to see a situation where that investment may go to other countries because some of these people are not resident in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">My last two questions are relevant to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  First, I fail to understand why the roll-out of broadband has been put on the back-burner by his Department as far as rural areas are concerned.  Second, why has the grant for energy efficient homes been withdrawn?  It makes no sense that 1,500 houses have been excluded from the grant system at a time when we are promoting energy conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I do not wish to be negative but rather to be fair and practical in my comments.  I have been consistent in this regard throughout my time as a public representative.  We must address matters that are important to us and to our constituents.  We should never shy away from speaking up, whether we are in Government or Opposition, on issues important to the public.  I always believed that.  People in this House and elsewhere will respect us so long as we are consistent in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I thank Deputy Finneran for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2008.  I begin by welcoming the comments made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in the Chamber yesterday in regard to the Cork docklands project.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_319">The Cork project is at the beginning of a process of evaluation and we need to assess how best to devise proposals that would meet with EU state aid requirements.  It is an exciting project but at this stage it is still a work in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">He went on to say that the Cork docklands forum is expected to report by the middle of the year and that he remained "open to looking at ways in which the tax code can be used creatively to encourage investment and change behaviour".</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I take great heart from those comments.  It is important to put the docklands project in context.  The area comprises 166 hectares on both sides of the River Lee.  The project sets out a vision for a new urban quarter characterised by high-quality design, residential, employment and leisure opportunities, and a superb quality of life in a high-density urban setting.  It is a short to medium-term project underpinned by the national development plan and the national spatial strategy.  It is incorporated in the Cork area strategic plan and the Cork city development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I acknowledge the immense work carried out to date on the project by the lead organisation, Cork City Council, particularly the directorate set up specifically to deal with the project.  I note the contribution of Mr. Pat Ledwidge, the director, and Mr. Joe Gavin, the city manager, who drove forward the Cork docklands development strategy 2001 and the Cork docklands economic study 2006.  Next week, on 11 February, Cork City Council is expected to adopt the south docks local area plan.  The overall docklands venture is estimated to be a €4 billion project and it has the potential to bring 20,000 additional residents to Cork city and to create up to 25,000 jobs.  I look forward to the completion of the report of the Cork docklands steering forum this summer.  I am sure this report will provide the template and guidance for further Government support for the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In debating the Finance Bill, we must consider the current economic backdrop.  The projections for 2008, which underpin the fundamentals of our economy, are a targeted gross domestic product, GDP, increase of 3% in real terms, the creation of 24,000 new jobs and the maintenance of inflation at 2.4%.  We are aiming for a general Government deficit of 0.9% and a debt to GDP ratio of just under 26%, which would be one of the lowest in the European Union.  Thus, the Finance Bill is based on realistic but challenging targets that we must achieve if the progress of recent years is to continue.  The early indications are positive.  I welcome the January Exchequer returns which, although only preliminary, are in line with Government projections.  We hope that trend will continue in the months ahead and that the outturn for 2008 will be in line with the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">It is important to acknowledge the volatility in the financial markets and the impact this has had on every open, developed economy, including Ireland.  It is clear that no country can completely insulate itself against the implications of instability in financial markets.  The sub-prime crisis in the United States and the subsequent credit squeeze has undermined confidence in financial markets generally and has contributed to the 26% reduction in the ISEQ index in 2007.  The volatility and sensitivity of the market to emerging data was underlined this week when a company as consistently successful as Ryanair saw its share price reduced by 15% at one point as a consequence of a statement concerning trade conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The World Bank this week cut its growth projection for China to 9% because of uncertainty in the global economy.  Since 1997, the Irish economy has grown by an average annual rate of 7%.  This puts into context the outstanding economic performance of the State in recent years.  There must be stability in interest rates in the coming months, and some downward movement would be welcome.  The European Central Bank is widely expected to leave rates unchanged following its meeting tomorrow.  It is interesting that all 83 economists polled by Reuters last week expected the rates to be unchanged, and most expect cuts to 3.75% by June and to 3.5% by the end of the year.  This would offer some relief to mortgage payers, complemented by the extension of mortgage interest relief as set out in the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Bill includes several pro-business measures.  I particularly welcome the reduction in the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and business-friendly measures such as revised preliminary tax payment arrangements for corporation tax for small and start-up companies, the increase in VAT registration for small businesses and the enhancement of the research and development tax credit scheme.  These measures will help to make our economy more competitive and to generate entrepreneurial activity.  We must create an environment that encourages people to take the risk of setting up a business.  There must be a pro-enterprise culture that responds favourably to people who take that risk.  It is essential we continue with the low taxation regime for corporation tax and send out a clear signal again that there is no threat to the 12.5% corporation tax rate Ireland enjoys at present.  The performance of the Irish economy in 2008 will have much to do with confidence and consumer sentiment.  There has been far too much negativity about our economy in recent months.  As public representatives, we have a duty to use our position to promote our economy and instil confidence in businesses and consumers about the future of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the changes to stamp duty in the residential sector, the further improvements in the income tax and tax credit areas for individuals, the environmental measures, the changes to VRT and motor taxation and the changes to the VAT regime on commercial property.  In my former life as a chartered accountant, I was familiar with the complexity of treating VAT on long-term and short-term lettings of commercial property and I welcome the changes the Minister announced in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I wish to concentrate on three aspects of the Finance Bill which relate to issues omitted from, rather than included in, the Bill.  I commend the Revenue Commissioners, and the Department of Finance if it had a role in it, on their new production, Simple Guide to Tax Credits, which is being sent out to taxpayers.  It is a very good publication, a huge improvement on any literature on tax credits sent out to people previously and it is very welcome.  Many people do not yet understand the area of tax credits.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_332">As public representatives, we must remind ourselves annually of the different aspects of the tax credit system.  This publication is worthwhile, well explained and well illustrated, and I congratulate those involved in producing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">However, I draw attention to the reproduction of the tax credit certificate in the publication.  There is a note to taxpayers which states that this section lists the yearly tax credits one now gets, that the amount of tax credit one pays is reduced by the amount of each tax credit and that tax credits are worth money to one and that one should make sure to claim if they are due.  It is important to try to get across the message that people need to claim their due tax credits.  However, tax credits are not necessarily worth money to everybody and that is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">It is about a decade since the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, signalled his intention to introduce a tax credit system.  He was very much praised for that move at the time.  We all looked forward to the introduction of a tax credit system and the development of that as the years went on but, unfortunately, we have not seen that kind of development.  We are still at the very early stages of the introduction of a tax credit system.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I very much regret that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity to expand that system because it has much potential in terms of providing flexibility and a very effective instrument to the Minister of the day to achieve certain things through the tax net, particularly in regard to the redistribution of wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The move to calculate income tax on a tax credit basis instead of a tax allowance one has made very little appreciable difference to most workers.  The standard rating of some tax credits could have been managed under the old system.  It seems the Government has changed the method of calculating income tax rather than changing the calculation itself.  Without applying all tax credits on a refundable basis, the move to tax credits has been largely meaningless.  Without a refundable tax credit system, people outside the tax net, typically those on low wages or in part-time, seasonal or term-time work, lose out on every euro in tax relief available to those inside the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Taking minimum wage earners and low paid workers out of the tax net is obviously very welcome but it is not enough.  Figures published recently show that 30% of all households at risk of poverty are headed by a person in a job.  What that indicates is the move towards a low income economy, which has occurred in recent years, and the fact that all of us as public representatives are increasingly coming across families where the head of the household is working but simply cannot make ends meet because the wages are so low.  Agencies, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, have drawn attention to this problem on numerous occasions.  The working poor undoubtedly need and deserve State assistance.  The absence of a fully refundable tax credit system is preventing that.  If we were to move towards refundable tax credits, it would be possible to target those people and families, in particular, who are most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Minister boasted recently about the fact that almost two out of every five workers are now outside the tax net.  That is very welcome but it means that for the almost 40% of the working population, improvements in the budget, whether in the level of tax credits or any new tax credits, are of no benefit to them.  Families on low incomes outside the tax net have not benefited from recent budgets.  The only way to tackle this issue is to move towards a system of fully refundable tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">There has been a small amount of movement on tax relief on mortgage interest and on medical insurance costs.  Those credits are now refundable, which is welcome, but what about all the other credits?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_340">The credits equate to four ECB interest rates.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_341">There should be a fully refundable system in place so that even if a person does not pay tax, he or she gets the benefit of additional initiatives in budgets.  Too many people were precluded from changes and benefits in recent budgets.  We need to change that and introduce a very targeted instrument to improve the situation of working poor families, in particular, which are finding it very difficult to survive.  That call is echoed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In its pre-budget submission.  It appealed to the Government to move towards a fully refundable tax credit system.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I refer to tax relief on pensions.  At present there is a rich man, poor man approach in that the more one earns, the more benefit one gets from the State.  That is not an equitable system by anybody's reckoning.  As it stands, one can claim tax relief on pension contributions up to €250,000.  There is no justification for that.  Those who are wealthy and who can afford it are welcome to put away as much as they like for their pensions, that is their business, but the State should not subsidise those pension contributions.  The level of relief available to people at the top rate annually equates to more than twice the State old age pension.  That is indefensible and should not be allowed to continue.  There should be a reasonable cap on the level of relief.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions again raised this issue.  It talked about a cap of approximately €130,000 in terms of contributions.  That is pitched at just about the right level.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I refer to the approach to the taxation of rental income which came up recently at the Committee of Public Accounts when the Revenue Commissioners appeared before it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General described Revenue's approach to taxing rental income as haphazard and ineffective.  They are fairly damning words to use.  That area needs to be seriously tightened up and a serious approach to pursuing the many people who have a nice income from rental property which is not tracked and taxed needs to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I referred to three areas which I regret are not tackled in this year's Finance Bill and I will pursue them with the Minister.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_180">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_346">The Government has a long-standing policy of responding to requests for election observers in as positive a manner as possible.  Over the last ten years, Ireland has participated in over 80 missions and has fielded more than 750 election observers.  The election observation mission programme is run by the volunteering unit in the development co-operation division of my Department.  This is located in the new Irish Aid volunteering and information centre in O'Connell Street in Dublin, which was officially opened last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_347">Our main partner organisations for co-ordinating election monitoring are the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the United Nations volunteers programme.  Irish Aid also supports the election observation activities of the Carter Center, especially its programme to promote best practice in election observation.  We send a small number of Irish observers to work with the Carter Center on its election missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_348">The procedure for the selection of observers for these missions is based on processes developed by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which was the original agency responsible for administering the scheme.  Since the integration of APSO into Irish Aid into 2004, the same approach to the selection of observers has been taken.  A register of volunteers with election experience is maintained and updated on an annual basis.  Selection for missions takes into account the skills required such as language proficiency and experience and knowledge of the country concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_349">In recent years, the election observation programme has been further developed with the fielding by Ireland of long-term observers for the first time in 2006, the inclusion of parliamentary representatives on the roster and the provision of training programmes for short-term observers.  The numbers of participants in election observation missions has risen from 43 in 2004 to 95 in 2007.  Currently we are considering invitations to observe forthcoming elections in Armenia, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal and Russia.  I hope that we will be in a position to make a positive response.</p>
            <p eId="para_350">In the interests of transparency and best practice, the roster is currently being updated with a view to putting it onto the Irish Aid website.  I intend to continue to take a pro-active approach to having an Irish presence in election monitoring, where and whenever possible.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_181">
            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_351">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Following the elections in Nigeria and Venezuela, the losing Opposition condemned the election and claimed the votes were rigged.  The same thing happened in Kenya and as sure as night follows day, we will soon have it in Pakistan and Zimbabwe.  In 1989, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution on enhancing the effectiveness of the principle of periodic and genuine elections.  The resolution received almost unanimous support and since then there have been many resolutions modifying it and supporting it.  I ask the Government to take the lead on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_352">There were no UN observers in Kenya — the observers were from the EU.  However, it strikes me that they carry no weight and that they have no authority.  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs use the influence of the Government at the next General Assembly of the UN to try to tighten this proposal?  We could then get agreement from the countries to be supervised that there would be some mechanism in place to sign off and state that the elections were conducted properly.  At the moment, elections in many of these regions are a farce.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_353">I agree with the Deputy.  There were two elections in Kenya and Georgia over the Christmas period which were of great interest to our Department.  Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of the Kenyan elections, its long history of political stability and the short notification we received, it was decided that the elections in Georgia would be prioritised.  The election results in Georgia were also challenged by the Opposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_354">We had ten short-term observers and one long-term observer representing Ireland during the election mission.  Given the recent events in Kenya, I hope that my Department will ensure Irish participation in any future EU election observation mission to that country.  I agree with the Deputy that we must take this matter further.  I would be glad to hear his views on observing elections.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_355">Since 1992, the UN has received over 400 requests for electoral assistance from over 100 member states.  The very first request was received in 1989.  I would like the Minister of State to give a commitment that the Government will look at amending those resolutions so that we will have a real role.  Shortly after confirming the election result, the Electoral Commission of Kenya disowned the result.  I am glad to hear that the Minister will do something about this, because we can play a very positive role in changing the resolution at the General Assembly.  Fine Gael may table a motion on the issue during Private Members' time in the coming months to get all-party support.</p>

            <p eId="para_356">I agree with the point made by the Deputy.  However, we must be asked to participate in monitoring elections and once an invitation is received from the EU, the OSCE or the UN volunteers programme, we make a decision on how best to respond to the invitation.  We try to do that as quickly as possible.  I would like to include parliamentary representation where possible and to have a good gender balance among the observers who attend these elections.  I will get back to the Deputy on those matters.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Breen</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         the steps the Government is taking to raise concerns regarding the possible violation of the fundamental human rights of Kenyan people following media reports of ethnic cleansing in the Rift Valley; if the distribution of Irish Aid is affected by recent developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_185">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_359">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 98 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_360">I remain deeply concerned by recent developments in Kenya, where over 1,000 people have been killed and between 250,000 and 300,000 have been displaced from their homes in the aftermath of the elections on 27 December and the announcement of the re-election of Mr. Kibaki as President.  The initial assessment by the EU election observation mission which monitored the elections stated that they fell short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections.  The chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya , Mr. Samuel Kivuitu, said that he could not say if Mr. Kibaki had won the election fairly, while Mr. Amos Wako, the Kenyan Attorney General, has called for an inquiry into Mr. Kibaki's re-election, casting serious doubts on the official election results.  It is important that all such allegations of election irregularities are urgently and thoroughly investigated through the appropriate channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_361">The ethnic dimension to the violence which has occurred is a matter of particular concern, and responsible leadership at the highest level is urgently needed.  I am also concerned by the fact that two Opposition MPs have been among those killed.  Any efforts to resolve the current crisis must also address more long-term issues, such as the need for constitutional and electoral reform and greater progress in tackling corruption within Kenya, as well as the immediate issue of the disputed election outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_362">A panel of eminent African personalities, headed by the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is currently attempting to mediate a political settlement between the Kenyan Government and the Opposition.  President Kibaki and Mr. Odinga have had two face-to-face meetings since the election, on 24 and 29 January in Nairobi, as part of Mr. Annan's mediation efforts.  These efforts achieved a breakthrough on 1 February, with agreement on a framework for negotiations covering the election outcome, the humanitarian situation, the political crisis and land tenure and reform issues.  The discussions are due to last a month and aim to end the current violence within two weeks.  At the same time, the fact that violence has continued is deeply disturbing.  The UN last night approached the Irish Mission in New York requesting us, along with a number of other donors, to provide financial support for the Annan-led mediation efforts.  Given our strong national support for Mr. Annan's efforts, we will respond positively to this request immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_363">My EU colleagues and I discussed Kenya at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 28 January.  Council conclusions were agreed which stress the need for a political solution to the violence in Kenya, and call on all sides to give the necessary full support to the mediation efforts of the eminent panel.  The Council conclusions make clear the EU's willingness to assist Mr. Annan's efforts in any way it can, if requested.  They stress that any solution must reflect the democratic will of the Kenyan people and that failure by Kenya's leaders to work seriously for a political resolution at this time is likely to have implications for future EU-Kenya relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_364">Senior officials from my Department have held meetings in relation to the situation with the Kenyan Ambassador in Dublin, and have conveyed to her the Government's serious concerns, particularly in regard to threats made against human rights defenders in Kenya, including Mr. Kiai, the head of the Kenyan National Commission for Human Rights.  The ambassador has confirmed that these concerns have been relayed to the highest levels of her government.  My Department has also been closely monitoring the consular situation and has regularly updated its travel advice, cautioning against any non-essential travel at the present time.  Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to Kenya.  However, as the Deputies will be aware, no aid goes through the Kenyan Government.  Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided just over €6 million in humanitarian funding for Kenya.  In addition to this, Irish Aid has provided over €16 million in funding since 2006 to Irish, international and local NGOs as well as missionaries working in Kenya, including World Vision, Trócaire and Concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_365">Last month, I announced an extra €1million in humanitarian funding for Kenya to be distributed through Irish NGOs there.  As indicated, we will also make funding available to support the Annan mediation talks.  There are no indications at the current time that humanitarian aid is not reaching those for whom it is intended.  I will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_186">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_366">I welcome the Minister's reply and the financial support for the Annan mission — as well as the additional support that has been committed in humanitarian aid.  I shall be supportive of any further requests that are received.</p>
            <p eId="para_367">I want to touch on that part of my question that asked about the violence that has broken out following the election.  It relates to the answer to the previous question, to some extent.  I have served as an election observer in Latin America and in Cambodia.  The European Union appoints long-term as well as short-term observers.  The difficulties in the Kenyan case mean that the whole election observing mission must be reconceptualised to include, for example, the tally.  The informal results that flowed from the election, in fact, were the trigger for the violence that happened in Kenya.  Again, it was an injudicious media leak that led to the violence in Ethiopia.  This time, perhaps, it was the responsibility of the European Union Mission.  It is worth considering the restructuring of the observation process.  The long-term approach meant that some 80% of the abuses are in the registration process.  The short-term is quite limited in its utility, looking only at polling day, when in fact it is the context and the media outfall that is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_368">As I have said, I welcome the Government's response to the humanitarian side.  Is the Minister not concerned, however, that the impact of so-called displacement is effectively little short of ethnic cleansing, to some extent, as regards the population movements?  Finally, in relation to what is happening in different parts of Africa, the largest proportion of that continent's population ever displaced is currently moving across borders in different conflicts, creating problems that cannot be handled by relationships among sovereign states and raising an entirely new set of issues as regards the human rights of the displaced peoples.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_187" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_369">On the latter point, that is one of the reasons why it was suggested Ireland should not attend the recent EU-AU Summit.  It was one of the reasons we were absent, at least at Head of Government level.  Our view, emphatically, was that we should attend, on the basis that we need to have a better relationship with the African Union, which is doing its level best with the difficulties attendant on it, to deal with some of these issues.  As the Deputy has said, the trans-border migration of tribes is not just an issue for Kenya, where there have been significant numbers of displaced peoples, but also for Chad, Sudan, Somalia and other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_370">As regards the humanitarian situation, there is no particular evidence at this time.  As part of the EU, however, we shall continue to monitor developments.  The situation is still serious, no doubt, but it has stabilised, despite a number of incidents in the last week or so.  As regards the whole issue surrounding the term "ethnic cleansing", there is no doubt ethnic conflict is occurring.  Much of this may be because the issue of the election has resurrected old scores and people, in effect, are perhaps pursuing old issues to do with land tenure.  I believe this accounts for a large element of what is happening between some of the tribes.  One must realise this is a very large country, with something like 40 different ethnic groupings and a population of 35 million.  By and large the unrest is confined to the Rift Valley area, although in one location there are some continuing difficulties.  Ultimately, the Annan process is one to which the two main political rivals seem to subscribe.  A number of countries, particularly in Africa, through the African Union, are endeavouring to assist this initiative.  I strongly agree with Deputy Higgins as regards the more long-term monitoring aspect of the registration process — within the election process.  That is something that might, perhaps, be looked at in the context of the Annan mediation talks, and we shall raise this issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_188">
            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_371">I welcome the Minister's reply as regards the amount of funding the Irish Government has given to Kenya over a number of years, in particular the €1 million given in recent times.  We are well aware of Irish development agencies working in Kenya, such Goal and Trócaire and of course the many Irish missionaries there.  I believe every parish could name someone working in Kenya, whether as a nun or priest.  I know a Fr. Martin Keane, who works there.</p>
            <p eId="para_372">While doing research on this question before coming to the Chamber, I came across a clip from Youtube.  It showed the difficulties the Red Cross has in distributing food in Kenya, particularly with the widespread roadblocks and the numbers of people displaced.  It reported 1,000 people being killed, 300,000 displaced from their homes etc.  I wonder whether the Irish missionaries or agencies working in Kenya have experienced any of that.  Are any of our missionaries in danger, particularly those who might be working in the Rift Valley?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_189" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_373">As far as possible we have liaised with all the people with whom we have contact and know are in Kenya.  I agree with the Deputy as regards the very strong Irish missionary presence there.  At this time we are not aware of anyone who is in grave difficulty.  After the initial outbreak of difficulties, however, we aided and assisted a considerable number of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_374">As regards the logistics of delivering food, there has been a dramatic improvement.  The World Food Programme, WFP, provided 80 metric tonnes in a significant internally displaced persons, IDP, camp, sufficient for one month's supplies.  On Friday and Saturday, 70 metric tonnes of food cereal and 27 metric tonnes of non-cereal were distributed to another ten sites.  There were some difficulties.  The Deputy is correct in his indication that WFP trucks had been stopped at roadblocks, but these have now proceeded with security escorts.  It would appear the issue of humanitarian aid delivery is being looked after.  There may, obviously, be incidents here and there, but by and large we are happy the aid is being delivered.</p>

         when the referendum commission for the Lisbon reform treaty will be established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_190" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_376">Following its signature in Lisbon on 13 December 2007, member states are expected to ratify the reform treaty by 1 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_377">The Attorney General has advised that the legal effects of the reform treaty require amendment of the Constitution to enable ratification by Ireland.  Under the Referendum Act, in the case of a constitutional referendum, the referendum commission can be established no later than the date on which the Referendum Bill is initiated in Dáil Éireann.  It is the Government's intention to resource properly the commission and to give it sufficient time to carry out its tasks.  Preparatory work is already under way to ensure the commission is in a position to undertake its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_378">In this respect, the Government Supplies Agency recently published a notice inviting tenders for the supply of bilingual booklets by the referendum commission to inform the electorate about the reform treaty.  While the work of the commission is entirely a matter for the commission, it is expected that between 2.4 million and 2.5 million booklets will be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_379">The timing of the referendum is currently under consideration by the Government and the drafting work on the referendum Bill is at an advanced stage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_384">There must be some sort of hearing chasm between us here.  Will the Minister agree that the failure of the Government to name a date for this referendum is creating a vacuum which is of no great assistance to those who support a yes campaign?  The vacuum is allowing much misinformation and inaccurate commentary on the treaty.  Can the Minister give any indication as to the date?  Will it be pre-summer or in the autumn?  Can the Minister give any indication of the composition of the referendum commission?  How is it established and for how long will it be established?  What are its terms of reference?  A previous commission put one argument on the left hand side and other argument on the right hand side and the argument was spurious.  Will he agree it is not the role of the referendum commission to indicate two sides to the one story?  Its role should be to get the information out to the public.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_196" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_385">I do not agree with the Deputy that the Government has been in some way lethargic.  The reform treaty was only signed on 13 December.  We have to prepare legislation which is currently with the Attorney General's office.  The referendum commission will not be able to be up and running any earlier than the day the Bill is published.  The normal course is that after the Bill is published the referendum commission would be set up in good time for whenever the date for the referendum is chosen.  The Deputy is aware of this.  We are liaising with the Deputy's party and other like minded parties in the Oireachtas on a possible date and also whether it is linked with any other referendum.  From that point of view, a website is already up and running and is widely used by the general public.  We have already issued a small explanatory leaflet which is widely available.  In the next couple of weeks we will publish a 20 page user's guide on the reform treaty.  We will publish a White Paper and, obviously, the Bill.  There will be a debate in the House and I hope the Deputy's party is as well prepared as our party.  I understand the Deputy's party has already set up a structure within his party to prosecute a good campaign on behalf of the major political parties who are in favour of the treaty.  In regard to the terms of reference, it will be for the commission to promulgate information on the treaty.  Heretofore, in the earlier EU referenda, it had to promulgate a yes and a no.  The referendum commission will be properly resourced.  In the Estimates campaign last year I readily received €5.8 million from the Minister for Finance which will be available to the commission once the Bill is published and the Government makes a decision on the date of the referendum.  The commission will have the required time.  Usually it requires about three months to promote a referendum campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_386">Is it a matter solely for the Government to decide the composition of the referendum commission?  Does the Minister feel hamstrung, or that his hands are tied behind his back, by the McKenna judgment in that as a Government it cannot go out and promote its view on the issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_387">The composition of the commission is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There are a number of members who, by legislation, have to be on the commission.  It will be the job of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to propose a chairperson who would normally be a High Court judge.  We have already received very strong advice from the Attorney General that in his opinion the issue of the McKenna judgment does not kick in until the day the Bill is passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President.  I understand a number of organisations are taking a much more conservative and restrictive view in regard to that issue.<b/>The strong advice given to Government in regard to the McKenna judgment is that it does not kick in until the day the Bill is passed.</p>

         the role of the interdepartmental committee on development in relation to the operation of the Irish Aid project within his Department; the points of decision making within the structure and the role of such an advisory body as exists, its role, and relationship to the interdepartmental committee on development and himself or the Minister of State at his Department.

            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_393">The White Paper on Irish Aid included a commitment to establish a new interdepartmental committee on development to strengthen coherence in the Government's approach to development and to make best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service.  I am pleased to say that, in line with that commitment, an interdepartmental committee on development has been established.  It has met three times under my chairmanship.  The next meeting will take place at the end of February.</p>
            <p eId="para_394">The committee aims to strengthen coherence on development policy across Government.  Development co-operation does not take place in isolation from other Government policies and the need for greater coherence in policies across sectors that affect developing countries is recognised.  Examples of issues that are vital to the developing countries include trade, climate change and debt relief.  Government Departments are represented on the interdepartmental committee by senior level officials who are actively engaging in the work.  Two subgroups of the committee have been established, one to look at developing a more coherent policy in our relationships with multilateral organisations and the second focusing on making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service in our development aid programme.  The committee will report annually to the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlining its activities and making recommendations as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_395">The advisory board for Irish Aid was established in 2002 to provide oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries.  The board's membership is drawn from a broad range of backgrounds, including the non-governmental organisations, community, public service, social partners and the business sector.  The board's mission is to oversee the expanding programme, advise on strategic direction and work closely with Irish Aid to maximise quality, effectiveness and accountability.  The current board's term of office will end later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_396">A major review of the management of the Irish Aid programme is currently under way.  The aim of the review is to ensure the systems, structures, procedures and staffing of Irish Aid can deliver a high quality aid programme as funding expands towards reaching the target of 0.7% of GNP target by 2012, as committed to by the Taoiseach.  It is hoped the review will be completed this spring.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">I am grateful for the Minister of State's reply.  What is the relationship of the interdepartmental committee to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?  I was trying to tease out in my question the relationship of the advisory board to the new interdepartmental committee.  My understanding is that the advisory board's advice to the Minister is not published nor is it available to us in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Is the advice or the advisory board accountable to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?</p>
            <p eId="para_398">The final question is very practical.  What is the role of Irish Aid within the Department of Foreign Affairs in regard to the selection of projects?  Is it the case that Irish Aid decides the project or that it monitors the project upon which a decision has been given by the interdepartmental committee, in other words the Vote in relation to Irish Aid?  Are the decisions on the principles taken within Irish Aid or has its role changed so that it now monitors the expenditure on decisions taken by the committee?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_399">The board and the committee have essentially advisory roles but this is not to underestimate their influence.  Their recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs draw on a wide range of input and expertise and they feed directly into the work of Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_400">On the question of projects, at present the advisory board is at the United Nations in New York.  We are very grateful to its chairman, Chris Flood, who visited Indonesia following the 2004 tsunami.</p>
            <p eId="para_401">It is clear that while they have different roles, both bodies are advisory.  To give an example, at one of the meetings of the interdepartmental committee that I chaired, the Dutch experience of policy coherence for development was presented.  I am happy with the progress the interdepartmental committee is making.  I plan to report to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the work and relevant recommendations of the committee by next June.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_206">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_402">I appreciate the good work the Minister of State is doing and I am sure he is chairing the group well.  However, I am still left with the two questions.  Irish Aid is structured so that the funding is voted to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is not only a case of who takes the decision but also who forms the options.  Is it the case that the interdepartmental committee is forming the options so the proposals are moved from Irish Aid and are now the possession of the interdepartmental committee?</p>
            <p eId="para_403">The second issue relates to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a long-standing member.  If that committee's sub-committee on development asks the interdepartmental committee to make a presentation to it, will it be Irish Aid which attends or representatives of the full committee?  Will they be able to tell the sub-committee how proposals are initiated, processed and decided?</p>
            <p eId="para_404">On a final point, I need an assurance that the role of Irish Aid would not simply be that its staff would monitor the expenditure on projects that have been decided outside the Department, which might not necessarily make the aid side of the issue the priority criteria for decision-making.</p>

        [3686/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_212" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_413">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 139 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_414">After several years of deepening crisis, there have been clear signs of a significant improvement in the security situation in Iraq in the past six months.  There has been a marked reduction in violence in almost all areas, especially Baghdad, and in many towns and cities something approaching normal civilian life has again become possible.  However, as the appalling bombings in Baghdad demonstrated last week, the situation facing the Iraqi people remains fraught and dangerous.</p>
            <p eId="para_415">The strengthened security drive launched by Iraqi and US forces has been a key element in the reduction in deaths and violent attacks.  Other critical factors have been the suppression of groups linked to al-Qaeda in Sunni areas and a ceasefire by the main Shia militia, which had been implicated in widespread sectarian killings.  While welcoming the improvement, it is important to note that none of these factors is irreversible.</p>
            <p eId="para_416">It has been clear that there is no simple security solution in Iraq.  Lasting peace and stability can only be assured through a process of genuine political reconciliation between the communities in Iraq and the co-operation of all its regional neighbours.   Unfortunately, the political reconciliation process has moved more slowly than desired.  The passage of a new law relaxing the exclusion of former Ba'athists from public life is an important step but other crucial issues remain deadlocked for now, including the review of the constitution, division of oil and gas revenues and the position of Kirkuk.  There have been suggestions of a more pragmatic engagement between the parties behind the scenes and the UN has strengthened its efforts to promote progress.  It is now essential that Iraqi leaders act urgently in the eased security climate to achieve real progress in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_417">There have been various attempts to estimate the casualties in Iraq, with a wide range of figures being suggested.  The respected NGO, Iraq Body Count, estimates that between 80,000 and 90,000 civilians have been killed since 2003.  This may represent an underestimate of the actual figures but I have no means of assessing the accuracy of the different figures.  Whatever the figures, there is no room for doubt as to the appalling level of suffering experienced by ordinary Iraqi people.  Nor can we lose sight of the resulting refugee crisis.  There are more than 2 million refugees outside Iraq, mostly in Syria and Jordan, and perhaps another 2 million internally displaced.  It is encouraging to note that a good number have returned to Iraq in recent months but it is also clear that very large numbers will need humanitarian assistance for some time to come.  The EU and Ireland nationally will continue to play their part in addressing this crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_418">The Government has outlined its position on the legality of the war on many occasions.  Ireland was not ready to participate in the 2003 military campaign in the absence of an explicit Security Council mandate.  Since October 2003, the presence of the multinational force in Iraq has been authorised by a series of UN Security Council resolutions.  The latest resolution, adopted unanimously in December on the request of the Iraqi Government, extends the mandate to the end of 2008.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_213">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_419">I am grateful the Minister is taking the two questions together.  Question No. 139 asked him to state unequivocally that the Government's view was that the war was illegal and without mandate.  He may wish to return to this question.  It is not a case of Ireland being unable to participate in the absence of a resolution; it is a case of Ireland being required out of respect for international law to condemn a war that was illegal and without mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">I am grateful to the Minister for giving the tragic estimate of 80,000 to 90,000 for the number of civilians killed, although he agrees it is not possible to be precise.  I am concerned that part of his reply seems to suggest that what is called the "surge" is having an effect.  There is considerable evidence to suggest its effect is quite limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_421">Question No. 139 asked about the consequences for the region.  It is very important to pin down the point that the later resolutions of the United Nations cannot retrospectively confer a legal status on an illegal act that took place some years earlier.  It is important to respect that distinction.</p>

            <p eId="para_422">The legality or otherwise of the Iraq war has been debated many times inside and outside the House.  There has been no international consensus as to whether it was legal or illegal.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_424">We were not prepared to participate but the subsequent resolutions were put in place and, although they were not unanimously accepted originally, they are now unanimously accepted year on year.  This has happened in particular at the request of the Iraqi Government, which seeks to have the continued presence of the multinational force to supplement the increasing level of Iraqi ability to secure its own territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_425">We know from our situation that despite some of the most horrific and unfortunate recent events in Iraq, the level of violence across the entire country is much lower than it was, which we should welcome.  Before Christmas, the Iraqi Foreign Minister briefed EU Foreign Ministers and painted a relatively good picture.  To a certain extent, some of us would have been a bit sceptical, but there has been a significant reduction in the level of violence there.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_426">The Minister is quite right that there have not been as many atrocities in Iraq in recent times, with the exception of the two horrific market bombings last weekend.  Have the local security forces, including the police force, been more effective and have they received better training to deal with the security situation?  For how much longer will international security forces, such as the Americans, British and others, be needed in Iraq?</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_218" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_427">I cannot put a date on when the multinational force will leave Iraq but local security forces there have increased their capability.  Ireland is a substantial distance from Iraq but we have been part of the EU effort to try to assist the Iraqis' capacity to rebuild their judicial and security systems.  Last year, a significant number of Iraqi officials who have been involved in rebuilding prisons were here to liaise with our own Prison Service, at the latter's invitation, under the umbrella of EU assistance to Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">Deputy Higgins raised the question of regional stability and there are significant issues in that regard, not least the interaction by the Turks in northern Iraq.  While Turkey has a right to defend its own people from cross-border attacks, we must exhort any country to use military action only as a last resort.</p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_219">
            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_429">I wish to ask three short questions.  First, is it correct that in recent days young women with an intellectual disability, Down's syndrome, were used in suicide bomb attacks in Iraq?  I do not like using the term "suicide bomb attacks" in this context because they were used to blow up citizens in the middle of a market.  Is this information correct?</p>
            <p eId="para_430">My second question concerns our foreign policy over the years.  Has the Minister told the British and US governments about Ireland's opposition to the war in Iraq, both at regular EU meetings and other international fora?</p>
            <p eId="para_431">Third, the vast majority of people now accept that the Iraq war was illegal but, more importantly, events in recent weeks have shown that the vast majority of US citizens have adopted this position also.  I ask the Minister to push that line at UN and EU levels.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_220" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_432">It is the case that on Friday, 1 February 2008, bombs carried by two women exploded in markets in different areas of Baghdad, killing over 100 people and wounding 200 others.  Apparently, these bombs were detonated by remote control, which is probably one of the most dastardly operations that has ever been carried out in my memory.  We roundly condemn these bombings.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_222" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_434">Yes, they had a disability.  It shows the lengths to which these people will go to try to disrupt what is a very slow peace process.  Ireland's view has been made clear for many years.  The issue now is to give, as soon as possible, the democratically elected Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people an opportunity to be the authors of their own destiny.  Given the fact that they have continued to request the presence of a multinational force at least up to the end of 2008, as per the unanimous UN resolution, we should abide by that.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_223">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_435">In the course of his discussions with EU colleagues, has the Minister noted any concern at the manner in which they were conned by the falsification of evidence on weapons of mass destruction?  What are the implications for their parliamentary systems, including their accountability committees, given that they were lied to?  What is the Minister's view of the general damage done to the international parliamentary process, including within the European Union, by the tissue of deceit that was used to initiate a war that has caused 90,000 civilian casualties?  Is it not an appropriate topic for moral reflection by those who went along with it?</p>

            <p eId="para_436">I was going to ask the Minister if it is confusing to be in Government when Members of this House who vote for him actually oppose his policies.  Unfortunately, however, Deputy Finian McGrath has left the Chamber.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_437">What happened over the years in Iraq is a cause for reflection.  However, there is now a possibility that the democratically elected government of the Iraqi people is in a position to move out of what has been a terrible period in that country's history.  Of course, we should look back to see how things could perhaps have been done better.  While there has been significant turmoil in relationships between the US and other parts of the world, there is now a common threat to developing and developed countries given the incredible depths to which terrorists will go to disrupt peace efforts.  That is a far bigger threat to any of us who believe in democracy.  That is why it is important for all nations of goodwill to work together, within the restrictions of international humanitarian law, to ensure that these people do not have the ability to carry out such dastardly deeds such as those committed in Baghdad on 1 February.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">Seasonal rains caused flooding and landslides in central and east Java in December 2007 and January 2008, with reports of about 118 deaths.  Relief activities were principally conducted by the Indonesian authorities, including the national agency for search and rescue, provincial and district co-ordination units for disaster management and the Indonesian Department of Health.  The Indonesian authorities, the Indonesian Red Cross Society and NGOs on the ground were equipped with the capacity to respond effectively to the flooding and landslides and no general international appeal for assistance was issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, IFRC, is a key partner of Irish Aid in responding to the sudden onset of natural disasters.  Under our partnership agreement for 2006-07, we contributed €1 million to the IFRC's disaster relief emergency fund, and we will contribute a further €2 million during the period 2008-09.  This fund ensures that immediate financial support is available for Red Cross and Red Crescent societies to respond to emergencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">Irish Aid also supports the UN's central emergency response fund, CERF, which, since its inception in 2006, has contributed over €52 million to the fund.  CERF was established with Ireland's support specifically to facilitate rapid response to emergencies by pre-positioning funds for urgent humanitarian action.</p>

Of the €20 million contributed to the tsunami relief effort, €6.4 million was allocated directly to Indonesia and a further €5.6 million to the south Asia region, including Indonesia.  A special envoy, Chris Flood, was appointed and he visited the country twice in the aftermath of the disaster.  The Irish people provided almost €80 million in private contributions to NGOs such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire and the Irish Red Cross.  It placed Ireland as one of the most generous nations.  Our funding was provided in those ways and, hopefully, we will also allocate funding of more than €2 million in 2008 and 2009.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
            <p eId="para_444">Last year Irish Aid published a value for money review entitled, Support to Tsunami Affected Countries.  It recommended that Irish Aid allocates more funds to monitor technical support in future large scale emergencies, greater standardisation of reports and contracts, more use of evaluations and increased engagement with joint funding mechanisms where appropriate and, in supporting future emergencies, a smaller number of partner agencies with specific expertise should be selected to ensure Irish Aid support does not become fragmented.  Since then, the organisation has provided funding in Mexico following severe flooding and Indonesia.  Were the recommendations in this review adopted in the provision of funding to Mexico and Indonesia?  Will the Minister of State outline the meetings he has had with his officials about the recommendations?  What has been done to implement them, given he has had two opportunities since the review to act on them?</p>

            <p eId="para_445">We have responded to other natural disasters such as Hurricane Noel in Mexico, the cyclone in Bangladesh, the Caribbean and central America, severe flooding in Uganda and Mozambique and the earthquake in Peru.  The Irish Red Cross and other NGOs in Indonesia had sufficient capacity to respond to the flooding and landslides.  No international appeal for assistance issued and, therefore, we knew of no major unfilled gaps during the emergency response phase that required a large scale mobilisation of international resources.  I will come back to the Deputy on the review to which he referred, as I must obtain more detail on it.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_231" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 109, 111, 124, 155, 224 and 225 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">I share the concern that events on the ground in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories threaten to undermine the important political progress which has been made in recent months.  I have strongly condemned the killings of Palestinian civilians in recent weeks and the continued firing of rockets from Gaza on towns in southern Israel.  I also condemn the appalling suicide bomb attack in the Israeli town of Dimona on Monday, in which an Israeli woman lost her life.  I know that the House joins me in extending our deepest sympathies to the families of all the victims.  I have stated many times that there are no military or violent solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The only way forward is through political negotiation, no matter how difficult such a course may be in the current circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">Ireland has been a long-standing and active proponent of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.  The Government has worked closely with other EU partners to ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in promoting a comprehensive settlement in the region.  It must be based on a lasting and just two-state solution, which must involve the creation of a viable, independent and democratic Palestinian state based on the political unity of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_456">We warmly welcomed the agreement reached in Annapolis last November and the subsequent opening of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with the target of agreement on final status issues by the end of 2008.  The Government has paid tribute to the courage of Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas in giving momentum to this negotiating process.  We have also strongly welcomed the renewed engagement of the US Administration.  At our meeting in Brussels last week, EU Foreign Ministers again underlined the importance of close involvement by the neighbouring Arab states, building on the historic Arab peace initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">In public statements and in my discussions over recent weeks, I have set out the Government's very real concern about the widening gap between the expectations of the negotiating process and the reality of people's daily lives.  This reality includes lethal violence in and from the occupied territories, the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and the continued construction of the security barrier on occupied land.  We have also consistently warned against the implementation of policies aimed at isolating the people of Gaza.  Urgent action is required to support the political process and to create an atmosphere in which political leaders can credibly consider the difficult compromises required for peace.  There must be an end to all violence, including suicide bombings, rocket attacks and military actions in Gaza and the West Bank and a genuine freeze on settlement construction.  The EU has stated unambiguously that all settlement construction on the West Bank and around Jerusalem is illegal and an obstacle to peace.  We have also called for the immediate lifting of restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, which are stifling economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_458">The Government and our EU partners have been monitoring the situation in Gaza particularly closely.  We remain gravely concerned at the humanitarian situation facing its 1.5 million inhabitants.  The Israeli moves to cut off fuel supplies were widely condemned internationally and have, thankfully, been suspended but more is required.  The EU has pressed for months for the reopening of Gaza's crossing points for people and for goods.  The Council last week emphasised the EU's support for a proposal from the Palestinian Authority that it assume control of the crossing points.  The clear lesson of the events at Rafah is that the isolation of Gaza's people is unjust, unsustainable and contrary to the interests of Israelis and Palestinians working for a peaceful settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_459">We strongly support the efforts being co-ordinated by Egypt, with Arab League support, for a solution based on the regulated reopening of the crossing points.  The EU has made it clear that it is ready to play a role in helping implement such a solution.  The EU border assistance mission which was established at the end of 2005 was suspended following the violence between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza last June.  The EU is ready to consider resuming the mission in the framework of an agreement involving the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Israel.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_232">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_460">I welcome the Minister's reply and I agree with much of it.  I welcome the return to EU statements of language such as "occupation", "illegal settlements", "expansion" and the reference to international law.  My question referred to the breach in the wall at Rafah.  Between 700,000 and 800,000 people out of a total of 1.5 million moved in 48 hours, which indicates the deprivation that exists in Gaza.  The representative of the United Nations relief and works agency in Gaza stated that to make the progress, Hamas needs to be involved in talks.  I agree entirely with the part of the Minister's reply that unequivocally condemns violence, be it in the context of rockets aimed at civilian villages in southern Israel or the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians.  One must be clear in this regard.  However, does the Minister agree it would be valuable if the Union engaged with both Hamas and Fatah in an effort to achieve a solution, even on the practical ground that the crossing point at Rafah is controlled by Hamas in Gaza?  Is it not somewhat abstract to suggest that Fatah will run a crossing point where it has no presence?</p>
            <p eId="para_461">Is the Union in a position to go back on its decision not to recognise the result of the elections?  The Minister mentioned the importance of international monitoring but these elections were monitored by the Carter Institute, among other bodies, and regarded as fair.  I do not defend Hamas but simply make a case for the future of a peace process that must include Hamas and Fatah.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_462">The thorny issue of engagement with Hamas resonates with our own difficulties in engaging with people who had the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other.  We have had this discussion on numerous occasions since Hamas was successful at the ballot box.  During my first visit to Jerusalem and Israel, the then Foreign Minister handed me the charter of Hamas and asked me to read the paragraph which declares that the primary aim of anyone who is a member of Hamas is the destruction of Israel.  If we really want a two-state solution, it must be two states both ways.  If Hamas is hell bent on the destruction of Israel, I am not altogether sure if we can engage with the party.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">The absence of reconciliation among the people of Palestine and the ongoing battle for hearts and minds between Hamas and Fatah represent a huge tragedy for the Palestinian people.  Ireland is forthright on the need for a Palestinian state, but from a diplomatic and democratic perspective it is difficult to negotiate with Israel when Palestinians themselves do not have the opportunity to speak with one voice.  One of the main efforts we have been making at EU level is to engage with moderate Arab nations in order to assist the coming together of the two factions in Palestine.  I hope this issue will be discussed at the upcoming meeting in Malta between the EU and the Arab League with a view to achieving some semblance of unity of purpose among the Palestinian people.  The EU has made it clear that it will not engage with Hamas until it fully commits to politics and the peace process and makes clear its readiness to support the two-state solution.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_234">
            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_464">Does the Minister agree that, while peace processes generally comprise small steps, in the case of the Middle East the best way forward is perhaps an acknowledgement of the final solution?  With respect to our questions on the Government's policy regarding the conflict between Palestine and Israel, he mentioned a two-state solution.  Am I correct in assuming that the Government's policy also includes a return to the pre-1967 borders, or borders as agreed by both parties, and an agreement on the return or otherwise of refugees from 1948 and 1967?  He mentioned in his reply that works should be frozen in the settlement areas.  Does that include the deconstruction of outposts built since March 2001?</p>
            <p eId="para_465">We also have to recognise the right of Israel to protects its citizens within international law and should condemn Palestinians for attacking Israel citizens in a wanton manner and ask them to desist from these attacks.  If that is Government policy, Fine Gael would support it.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">I ask the Minister to use his influence in the EU to play a greater role because we too often look to the United States to solve the problems in the Middle East.  If the problems between Palestine and Israel are solved, many other issues will be resolved as a result.  Does the Minister agree that the solution might lie in the EU building stronger trade links between Israel and Palestine because economic progress on the ground will be of great assistance to peace?  Perhaps the EU needs to be more proactive rather than handing the leading role to the United States.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_235" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_467">I do not agree that we have handed the leading role to the United States.  The fact is that the US has the greatest influence on the Israelis, so it has to be involved.  Thankfully, it has been more involved in recent times than heretofore.  The EU has been very active in this area.  As paymasters for the humanitarian situation, we provided in the region of €1 billion to the Palestinian people last year, which is a sizeable increase on the previous year.  We have also been heavily involved in all the negotiations and, as I noted earlier, the issue will be on the table at next week's meeting in Malta between the Arab League and the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">I concur with the Deputy's long list of governmental policies which are additional to the two-state solution.  These policies have been articulated by the Government and the EU over many years.  The Middle East peace process has been on the agenda of every General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting I have attended since 2004 and the EU has been very active in terms of discussions with officials and between the EU and Israel and Palestine aimed at bringing the matter to some sort of solution.  We would all accept that a solution to the Israel-Palestine issue would be the keystone for better regional stability.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_236">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_469">I have no difficulty in agreeing to the agenda set out by Deputy Timmins in regard to the elements of a final solution.  When we raised this issue previously, I noted that the Northern Ireland peace process had benefited from a permanent secretariat and drew a contrast with the so-called roadmap, which has no secretariat.  My suggestion was that a permanent secretariat might have been established for the Quartet.  Does the Minister agree it is difficult to accept the utility of the Quartet's proposals given that they will be advanced by one member, the United States, which has a considerable influence on Israel?</p>
            <p eId="para_470">Do I understand correctly that if the Arab League negotiates between Fatah and Hamas, the European Union would have no difficulty in negotiating with the Arab League on Palestinian interests?</p>
            <p eId="para_471">We are agreed on our condemnation of all violence but would the Minister agree it is tragic that the destruction of houses in East Jerusalem has not stopped and that settlement expansion has not been frozen at Ma'alih Adoumim and the area near Jerusalem?  There has been both an extension of settlements and what is referred to in Israel as a thickening of existing illegal settlements.  The Minister's credibility is at stake if he does not also condemn that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_237" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_472">I agree with the Deputy on the issues he raised in regard to the increasing and deepening of the settlements.  We were surprised but welcomed President Bush's condemnation of the settlements and his clear indication that the US was of the view that they should not continue.  If a two-state solution is ultimately to be found, these creeping increases in settlements will leave the issue of borders that bit more difficult to solve given the fact that people have moved in.</p>
            <p eId="para_473">I accept fully that the Israelis have significant issues in regard to what is emanating from Gaza but Israel has engaged in collective punishment of the people of Gaza.  There are ways and means of addressing the difficulties that arise in Gaza but to mete out punishment on one of the most populous areas of the world is unjustified.  These issues point to the need for a greater focus on this area.  I do not say Deputy Higgins's suggestion of a permanent secretariat for the Quartet should not be considered.  Perhaps it should be given even greater consideration in light of the significant number of international envoys — Tony Blair not least among them — present in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_474">The simple lesson to be learned from the Irish peace process is that there can never be a military solution to the problem, which is something the Israelis and Hamas must understand.  This realisation confirms the view we have always expressed, namely, that the only way to deal with this matter is through engagement involving moderate Arab states, the US, the EU and the Palestinian people and the Israelis.</p>

         his plans for the distribution of overseas development aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_238" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_476">The focus of Ireland's overseas development programme is the elimination of poverty.  Irish Aid works to improve access to basic health care, education, clean water and adequate housing for some of the poorest communities in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">The White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September 2006, identified the principles and priorities for the programme as it expands to meet the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on our ODA by 2012.  It also sets out a wide range of initiatives that will be funded under the expanded aid programme.  Africa will remain the principal focus of our assistance in the coming years and the number of our partner countries will increase from eight to ten.  Malawi has been selected as our ninth partner country and a programme of development co-operation will begin there this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">The struggle against HIV-AIDS is particularly important and we allocate over €100 million in respect of it and other communicable diseases every year.  We also need to maintain our ability to respond quickly and effectively to humanitarian disasters.  The rapid response initiative announced in the White Paper has already considerably improved our capacity to respond to these crises.  Other priority areas include good governance, conflict prevention, gender and the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">Our commitment to working in partnership with NGOs is as strong as ever.  Some of Ireland's largest NGOs will receive over €100 million from the Government this year.  Irish Aid will also provide €20 million this year in support of the development work of Irish missionaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">The United Nations has a strong mandate to tackle global poverty and Irish Aid is increasing the level of assistance channelled through specialised agencies such as UNICEF, the UNDP and the UNHCR.  The European Union is the largest development assistance donor in the world and Ireland's contribution to this effort through the European Development Fund is expected to reach €206 million between 2008 and 2013.  Ireland plays an active role in shaping and monitoring EU aid expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_481">We are also working with global initiatives, particularly in the areas of health and education, to deliver long-term change.  These include the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">Our plans for the distribution of Ireland's overseas development assistance are guided by the principles of partnership, transparency and effectiveness.  The opening of the Irish Aid volunteering and information centre on O'Connell Street in Dublin last month will allow the public to engage more directly with development issues and with the programme as it expands in the coming years.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
            <p eId="para_483">Some people have suggested that the model we use to dispense Irish aid generally should be reformed.  I refer to the report I mentioned earlier, namely, the value for money review carried out by Irish Aid, which states that the organisation should, in addition to asking for reports on individual projects, also request external evaluations of the overall programmes to which it contributes.  The report specifically recommends that Irish Aid should consider making all grants of €300,000 and above conditional on such an overall and external programme being undertaken and submitted.  What is the Minister of State's reaction to the concerns expressed in respect of basic reporting requirements?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_484">The peer reviews carried out by the OECD show that Ireland comes top of the class in the context of its aid programme.  The Minister has written to the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, regarding the establishment of a new foreign affairs committee and the renaming of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">We have our own audit committee and we work closely with other countries in respect of their auditing systems, particularly in the context of tackling corruption, a major obstacle to development.  We work to strengthen judicial systems, assist civil society and support the independent media in some of the developing countries.  In Zambia, for example, we are contributing to the work of a special task force on corruption.  In Uganda we are supporting the reform of the justice system through the provision of additional resources for the prison system, the introduction of community service as an alternative to prison and the training of legal personnel and police and prison officers.  In Ethiopia we are supporting the audit functions within the Government there.  We are examining the audit issues that arise in developing countries and giving consideration to the systems employed by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">Between 2007 and 2009, we will provide €1.5 million in funding to another NGO, Transparency International, to assist it in its work to raise awareness and reduce tolerance of corruption worldwide.  We also work with the World Bank and United Nations agencies to agree anti-corruption and good governance strategies.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">The vast majority of migrants who come to Ireland do so for economic reasons.  CSO figures indicate that 35,000 people from the continent of Africa are resident here.  What steps are being taken to target money from the overseas development aid fund at countries from which people are migrating to Ireland and other EU member states in order that some of the economic issues arising in those countries might be resolved?  We should support the development of the economies in these countries rather than, as a result of our economic circumstances, encouraging their citizens to migrate here.  Would it not be better to improve the economic circumstances in their home countries rather than encourage them to come to this country to make a proper living?</p>

            <p eId="para_495">There have been many problems in Kenya recently and it is easy to anticipate the difficulties that will arise in respect of the elections in Zimbabwe next month.  I am disappointed that there is no intention on the part of Irish Aid to send observers to those elections.  A motion agreed by the House directed the Government to take particular steps in respect of voter registration in the context of support for NGOs and the protection of human rights.  The fact that we are not sending observers or even taking notice of what is due to happen next month means that we are sleepwalking towards a repeat of events in Kenya.  We should be less reactive and try to be more proactive in respect of Africa.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">There are measures in the Finance Bill that are laudable, such as the welcome measures to encourage companies to invest in environmentally-friendly equipment.  The measures under the save as you earn scheme are also a step in the right direction.  The health measures, such as the VAT reduction on non-oral contraceptives, including condoms, do not go far enough.  It is our contention that the Minister should have further reduced the rate to 5%, in line with the EU VAT directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I will specifically refer to the research and development tax credit.  The Minister should fix indefinitely 2003 as the base year for availing of the tax credit.  The Bill, as I understand it, extends the base year of 2003 for the purposes of the research and development tax credit for a further four years to 31 December 2013.  However, the Bill provides that the subsequent years' expenditure, for calculating the incremental spend, will be the ten years before the end of the relevant accounting period.  For example, 2014 will have a base year of 2004.  One can compare this to the UK position, which is based not on an incremental position but on all research and development spend.  This gives the UK a comparative advantage so we should consider adopting this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">If there is a new Minister of State responsible for innovation policy, I assume the Government is giving the notion of intellectual policy and innovation some degree of stature.  A gesture such as this would assist many companies and enterprises throughout the country which are increasingly endeavouring to heighten research and development spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Considering the matter <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign direct investment and its current unstable nature, we will have to rely on many indigenous industries.  Much work is being done within universities and third level institutions, and many spin-off companies are established from that and through venture capital.  Research and development will increasingly be a component of this process so we should incentivise it where possible.  Fixing 2003 as the base year rather than just limiting the credit to 2013 would have provided increased certainty and would have been a more favourable measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I will comment on my constituency of Cork East and the relevance of this Bill to such a constituency, where unemployment figures are rising.  It has been proven that in towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cobh and Midleton, the figures are going up year on year.  The current Amgen issue——</p>

          <p eId="para_516">We have lost traditional industries and, for example, the food industry is not what it once was and is going into decline.  Irish Sugar is no longer with us and Dairygold is downsizing its operation.  There is increasing uncertainty about Amgen.  In trying to be positive about how we proceed economically and taking north and east Cork as a region, if a similar situation becomes evident, we will have to rely on indigenous industries.  The Government must proactively seek to upskill those people working within existing industries and introduce some measures for employers to enable them to upskill and grow existing companies.  There are many family-based companies in these towns and I am sure they could do with some incentivisation to grow.  The Government should consider the issue given the current global economic climate.  I am not advocating looking inward but we can start thinking more locally about how to provide incentives to grow jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">These are the essential points I have sought to cover.  I would have liked the Finance Bill to provide for some composite scheme like the town renewal or urban renewal schemes.  Towns such as Mitchelstown, Mallow and, to a lesser extent, Fermoy are still characterised by certain areas where development has not kept pace with corresponding development on the outskirts of towns.  The Government could be in a position to consider some urban renewal scheme or an adjunct to the existing programme.  I realise a Goodbody report on the performance of the urban renewal schemes was published which indicated a slow take-up in some aspects of the schemes.  The climate is right for towns such as Mallow, Fermoy and Mitchelstown to benefit from those schemes so we could get rid of some of the dereliction still existing within the towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I have probably used much less than 11 minutes but I do not believe in filling time for the sake of it.  I have covered the points I wished to make and others which I could expand have been expounded upon by our finance spokesperson.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board.  I will be very happy to make the figures available to the Minister of State which prove beyond any doubt that unemployment figures have increased exponentially in these towns.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I welcome the Finance Bill introduced by the Minister and I welcome the Minister of State from Cork East.  He may give a different picture of Cork East later in the debate.  This is the fourth Finance Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and it demonstrates the consistent policy of the Government to make the tax system simpler, fairer and effective in lessening the burden on lower and middle income taxpayers.  Simplicity should always be a goal with the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I was surprised last week when the Leader of the Opposition asked the Taoiseach for a stimulus package similar to that introduced by President Bush in America.  The American stimulus package amounts to approximately 1% of GDP and the tax changes alone in this budget would be substantially in excess of 1% of GDP.  I may be corrected on that but when one adds increased social welfare spending, the budget adds up to more than a stimulus package as we are still in a strong period of growth compared with the United States.  We have continued to look after low and middle income earners, unlike President Bush, whom Deputy Kenny admires.  President Bush's tax changes appear to have benefited higher earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">There are some small provisions that may affect people.  There is an increase in the specified rates for preferential home loans and other loans.  Bank and financial services employees may have to pay for a small increase, which is probably fair enough because of the way interest rates have risen.  I would have thought those changes could be done by ministerial order as interest rates change to help those people to have a consistent tax payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I welcome in particular the changes in the rent-a-room scheme.  Many of my constituents have bought new houses in recent years.  I have also done so and have had rent-a-room tenants.  It is a great system where, subject to submitting tax returns, one can take income from rent tax free up to a limit, formerly of €7,620, which was increased in the Finance Bill to €10,000.  That is a significant benefit because it was the position that if one earned €1 over the limit one could be taxed on the total.  It encourages tax compliance because people can earn up to €10,000 per annum which is a substantial rent for a room or even two rooms.  I welcome the increase because rents are going up, particularly in Dublin.  People letting rooms in my constituency, Meath East, might not be at that threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I welcome the increased allowance on trade union membership because it is equivalent to a tax credit of €70 per annum.  We should encourage trade union membership because the unions have a long and valued history.  They continue to be of value, particularly in explaining their rights to, and standing up for, foreign workers.  Some seafarers were recently helped out in this way.  It is good that the tax system recognises this benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">It is wise and sensible of the Minister to increase tax credits generally, for employees, one-parent families and home carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The transfer of a site to a child rarely gets publicity but has an impact especially in rural Ireland.  A parent can transfer a site to a child, generally to build a house, without capital gains tax, or stamp duty and it is usually under the limit for capital acquisitions tax.  The limit on the site used to be €254,000 which until recently would have been quite acceptable, certainly where I come from.  In Dublin, however, if people were hiving off sites from city centre properties it might have been low but €500,000 is a good limit.  The anomalies in this scheme have been rectified.  It is important that the tax system helps children to build property on family land.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the county councils should also encourage this practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">People who transferred sites before these rules were brought in, when this party came into Government, may not have paid capital gains tax when they should have.  It happens too that a bachelor uncle with no children may transfer sites to nieces or nephews and while there may be some relief from capital acquisitions tax there may be a capital gains tax liability.  The Minister might consider this in future Finance Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The increase in the VAT registration threshold for small and medium sized enterprises is a good move.  Many people in my constituency work from home and while they are not yet millionaires they may be in the future.  I know several stay at home fathers who run very small businesses and staying below the VAT exemption limits or registration thresholds has a significant impact on their business because they can make a certain amount of money without worrying about getting into the VAT net.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I am glad to see changes being introduced in the VAT regime for commercial property transactions.  I do not claim to understand them all but never understood them before now.  The same is true for many solicitors, tax practitioners and accountants.  Nobody was ever willing to take responsibility for advising on VAT because they were afraid they would get sued if they were wrong.  I have not studied the changes in depth but I hope they allow professionals to make their own judgments on VAT.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_533">It is not acceptable for highly paid professionals routinely to rely on opinions from the Revenue Commissioners.  They may need to do so in respect of a complicated transaction but anything that simplifies that process is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I have a bone to pick with the Minister because I bought a car recently and am affected by the proposal on vehicle registration tax, VRT, which is not to take effect until July.  This may be hard on people who bought cars with lower emissions before the changes were announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I represent part of the town of Drogheda and in the bad old days there were cases when the gardaí ripped out vending machines for non-oral contraceptives.  How will the VAT change for these contraceptives impact on vending machines?  The only impact will be greater profit for the vendors.  I encourage pharmacists and manufacturers to pass on this VAT decrease.  It will be interesting to see if it works.  Reducing VAT on condoms is fashionable but while it is worthwhile it runs the risk of not being passed on to the consumer.  There is no way to reduce VAT at a vending machine to take or 25 or 23 cent off the price.  It is important that those who have called for this measure make sure that the consumer benefits and that there is a health benefit.  Whenever someone calls for a reduction in VAT there is the danger that it will not be passed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">There is some reduction in stamp duty on leases and renting of residential property.  Many vulnerable people rent from private sector landlords and it is important that they comply with all the legal requirements.  If stamp duty is paid and legal formalities completed the tenant's rights are enforceable in court.  Many letting agencies do not put in place rental agreements, which is a breach of the law, and rarely arrange for them to be stamped.  Few would pay €30,000 per annum in rent and anyone paying that much would pay stamp duty but is probably aware of his or her rights and obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Revenue Commissioners have already implemented the stamp duty changes for first-time buyers but this Bill legislates for them.  They could do a great deal more about, and there should be greater public awareness of, reporting of foreign rents received, and rents in general for landlords who live abroad.  If a solicitor sells a property on behalf of a client resident abroad he or she is personally liable for the capital gains tax if the money passes through his or her hands.  Solicitors take that obligation seriously and the Revenue Commissioners have forced some to pay over capital gains tax for their clients although they have not received the money from the clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">However, I am unsure whether letting agents, who may be in receipt of rents from landlords living abroad, are aware of their obligations to make returns on the rents received from those clients.  It would be worthwhile for the Revenue Commissioners to publicise this obligation.  I note that one proposed change in the Finance Bill is that an Irish letting agent who manages a foreign property on behalf of an Irish resident client must provide details of the rent accrued to a Revenue inspector.  This is a highly positive move because in so far as is possible, Revenue should collect tax from everyone.  Over the years, professionals, including solicitors, have been more than happy to pay over and certainly are aware of their obligations.  At present however, a considerable amount of money passes through the hands of letting agents that pertains to landlords living abroad or, on foot of the proposed change, to Irish residents with property abroad.  The Revenue would do well to make it as clear as possible to agents and landlords what are their obligations in respect of rents received.  However, this measure is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">That all professionals are becoming enforcement officers for Revenue is to be welcomed.  Everyone co-operates and with lower tax rates and a much simpler tax system, no one minds.  Nowadays people do not mind paying tax.  Members are aware of what transpired in the 1980s when extremely high rates of tax applied and there was a huge disincentive to pay tax.  In general, people now are more than happy to comply with their obligations and only a few try not to do so.  While professionals have a role to play in this regard they must be made fully aware of what is their role, because I am unsure whether all understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Economic prospects are good in my constituency, which in general enjoys very high rates of employment and, conversely, low rates of unemployment.  A certain number of people are employed in manufacturing in County Meath, much of which, certainly within Meath East, is connected to the construction industry.  The construction industry employs many people in Meath East and while matters are definitely looking up, some of those who had been employed in that sector are now looking for work.  When such people attend my clinics I tell them what they should be considering.  Apart from trying to get back into their own jobs, the first priority of those who left school at a young age or before acquiring qualifications at school and who now, unfortunately, have time on their hands, is to retrain and to acquire the qualifications they may not have got before entering employment.  Major manufacturers of buckets and steel equipment, which is indirectly connected to the construction industry, are located in my constituency and provide good jobs to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">While the farming industry is up and down, much farming activity takes place in my constituency and many farmers have other jobs.  In general however, people are happy with matters as they are and do not want Members to talk down the economy.  They understand the times——</p>

          <p eId="para_550">Members have good reasons for talking up the economy, both in recent years and this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">There is talk in the United States of recession, which is defined as being two quarters of negative growth.  This year, Ireland will achieve rates of growth of which the United States would be highly jealous.  One must acknowledge this point.  There is cause for concern and some people from my constituency, especially those connected to the construction industry, will lose their jobs.  However, the country is not going down the Swanee but is progressing extremely well.  People are highly educated and highly qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I follow developments in the United States with great interest and one of its features is the large number of the working poor.  While this phenomenon also exists in Ireland, the minimum wage here is much higher and it offers far greater opportunities for educational advancement.  This is the key to lifting people out of poverty and thereby growing the economy.  People in Ireland have good opportunities to receive education.  Ireland has free third level fees and low costs associated with education when compared with the United States and other countries.  Any major employer that enters the country will consider this to be an enormous bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Some third level courses operate in my constituency and in County Meath.  In general, they are connected to various universities and third level institutions.  However, County Meath is fortunate in that Dundalk Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, Institute of Technology, Tallaght, as well as the Dublin universities of DCU, Trinity and UCD are within reachable commuting distance.  Consequently it is a good location if one wants an education.  At present, County Meath does not possess a university.  While a university was proposed for the County Meath side of Drogheda before the establishment of Trinity College, that was too far in the past.  Nevertheless, ample opportunities for education exist.  I refer to those in the construction industry who may have lost out temporarily.  They should consider training, getting the leaving certificate and other qualifications.  It is important to bear in mind that matters are looking up.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I will not go into details.  However, the position is similar in respect of accountants in that the Revenue Commissioners will take them at their word.  While there are some excellent accountants and solicitors, every profession has its rogues.  Although checks and balances are required, the Law Society does not appear to have had many, given the manner in which an individual could run off with so much money.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">While the Finance Bill is under discussion, the law does not appear to operate in Ireland any more.  I refer to a man who is running around the world against whom, to date, no prosecutions have been brought.  Moreover, there does not appear to be a plan to have him extradited back to Ireland.  I cannot understand how a man could do this given the existence of professional bodies such as the Law Society.  Innocent people, some of whom had small accounts arising from the Government's saving scheme have been affected and will never see their money again,</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The Finance Bill is the subject of today's debate.  People accept that a major downturn has taken place in the economy.  As I remarked earlier, while the economy was doing well, all Ministers got the credit for the wonderful economy.  Even civil servants received praise for the great job they were doing.  However, as soon as problems arose in the economy, the problem lay not with the Minister but with the civil servants and everyone else.  Ministers do not take responsibility for the manner in which they have led in the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I was disappointed by the recent budget and the Finance Bill because I had expected to see major initiatives to try to revitalise the economy and restore Ireland to its former competitive state.  Ireland is no longer competitive.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, is present in the Chamber and has responsibility for small business.  Small businesses will state that they are being crucified by inspectors of all kinds, be they tax, VAT or health inspectors.  As soon as a downturn occurs in the economy, everyone is inspected.  Mayo County Council has just adopted water rates in a move that will put people out of business.  The day is over when one can expect local authorities or the public to be able to pay for benchmarking or to keep such people in jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I will provide an example.  I recently visited a premises in a town in County Mayo.  I do not wish to identify the person concerned because he is a small business man.  He showed a letter to me that was left by two health inspectors.  It was deemed necessary to send out two inspectors rather than one.  The businessman asked me whether I could discern any problems with his premises and I replied that it was so clean that one could eat one's dinner from the floor.  However, the inspector stood on a chair, checked underneath a container for hot water and found some dust.  Were anyone who wished to find dust to enter my house, or those of the Minister of State or Cathaoirleach, he or she would do so.  However, the problem is that we are paying for this.  The problem is that the inspectors annoyed that man for two weeks and sent him letters threatening legal action.  Small businesses are over-regulated and if this does not stop, the Minister of State and the Government will see more people going out of business.  Who does the Government blame?</p>

          <p eId="para_564">It blames Europe.  When decisions are made in Europe, our Ministers are supposed to protect our country but they and civil servants sometimes do not understand the directives.  It is only when legislation must be introduced at a later stage that they realise what they have signed up to.  Small businesses are sick and tired of being over-regulated.  Instead of helping and encouraging them and trying to increase employment, we are trying to drive people out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">We have every kind of authority and office in Ireland, each with a complement of staff.  The problem is that not one of them is producing anything.  All they are doing is creating problems for the people who are trying to generate revenue and employment.  There is no initiative to benefit small business or to encourage businessmen to employ people and that is why the economy is now in some difficulty.  We believed we could keep employing health inspectors, veterinarians, etc., with the result that every kind of person now has a job in an agency in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">As a Dáil Deputy, one receives reports from State bodies.  Those sent to me built up over a few weeks and it was only then that I realised how many agencies are in existence, each of which has a chief executive and staff.  They are creating problems for people who are just trying to make a living, create employment and keep their businesses open.  The latter get no support or help from the State; all they get is total hassle.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The HSE has taken over the health service and the only time a Minister is answerable is when there is a tape to be cut.  When there is good news, the Ministers for Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment or Finance are available, but when there is bad news the chief executive of the HSE or some other agency is deemed responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">A businessman who owns a private nursing home contacted me today.  The people in this home are there because the State failed to provide one for them.  They receive subventions in some cases and pay a contribution towards their care, yet the latest development is that when they go to hospital for appointments, be it for physiotherapy or otherwise, the hospitals send bills to the nursing home to collect money from them.  They should be in State care in the first place.  They are entitled to a bed but a bed cannot be found for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">As Deputy Flynn will confirm, there are patients in north Mayo with hospital appointments who cannot be brought to hospital any longer.  I have raised this matter in the Dáil and said I would not be able to sleep at night if I had to make decisions such as those being made by the HSE.  I met an employee of the HSE recently and the first point he made was that he had a good sleep the night before.  I said, "Fair play to you.  I certainly could not sleep if I made decisions like you make every day so that the sick, weak and elderly cannot be brought to hospital for their appointments."  His answer was that he needed more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I went outside the door and saw a jeep he had done up which had cost hundreds of thousands of euro.  It was equipped with machines that can film from the back, front and both sides.  The jeep is for national emergencies but when I asked the man how many emergencies there have been in recent years, he replied the only problem that arose necessitating its use was a bus accident on the day of an all-Ireland final.  The jeep is sitting outside the man's office and he probably brings it up and down the road every day for a spin to justify having it.  In spite of this, he cannot bring people to hospital for appointments and is running them out of his office every day and saying he wants more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I tabled parliamentary questions in this regard and was told by the Minister that there was never as much money invested in the health service.  I was told that administration, rather than money, poses the problem and that the service is not being run properly.  This Government must be made answerable in the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">When considering the forthcoming referendum on the reform treaty, in respect of which everybody wants a "Yes" vote, one should remember that people are annoyed.  I do not know whether the authorities in Brussels are gone mad or whether they do not have enough work.  They throw a proposal into the bin one day and pick it up the next, saying they need to think up another to justify their salaries or expenses.  On Monday, a man entered my clinic and referred to the spraying of cars.  Those who spray cars in garages are to be subject to an inspection and will have to have a licence to operate.  I have tabled parliamentary questions to determine whether this is on foot of a new EU directive.  At the meeting the other night, I was not sure whether it was laid before the Dáil — I do not remember it.  What has gone wrong?  Have the authorities in Brussels and Dublin gone mad?  Do they not want people to work?  Do we want to have everybody in offices in the Civil Service so they can get their salary every Friday evening?  Such people do not care because their cheque is available every Friday evening and they do not have to go out and try to make a living.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_575">The discussion of the Finance Bill in the House is always very important and significant issues arise over expenditure.  There has been a considerable debate for some time on the economy and reference was made to talking it down or up.  I am not one who likes to talk anything down.  I do not like that kind of politics and have never subscribed to it, but the reality is that everybody knows the economy is not as strong as it was and that this has repercussions.  A very simple example is the decrease in the number of applications for planning permission submitted to local authorities over the past year.  The figures for this January and February will point to the biggest drop ever, at least in my constituency.  This will have major repercussions for local authorities and those engaged in certain activities but we must all work together to ensure the economy is kept as strong as possible, particularly for the next generation.  People trying to buy houses could not afford to do so and in this regard the slowing down of the housing market will benefit many young people.  If circumstances were to remain the same, there is no doubt that most would not be able to afford a house, even if they had very good jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The budget presented in December highlighted many issues that one would like to address, one of which is broadband.  Reference has been made to how essential broadband is and there is nothing more scandalous than the delay in rolling it out.  Reference has been made to creating jobs in rural economies and in this regard Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned the many people, including fathers, who want to work from home.  There are many such people but the reality is that broadband is not available to the vast majority.  Let me cite an example.  I downloaded an item in my constituency office in Cashel last week and it took a minute and a half to do so.  The same information had to be inputted into the computer in my own home, where there is no broadband, but this took 27.5 minutes.  There is no broadband in my locality.  How can people compete in this kind of environment?  How can we create jobs if we are to ignore the roll-out of broadband on such a considerable scale?  The reality is that a significant number would work from home if there was improved broadband provision.  We hear every day, particularly from the Green Party, about our responsibilities in regard to energy conservation, reducing emissions from motor vehicles and so on.  The reality is that the Government, because it has failed to provide for adequate broadband provision, is driving people in every town, village, parish and townland who wish to work at home into their cars.  We are promised day after day and week after week that there will be access.  Private operators are advertising the availability of broadband throughout the State but people who try to connect to it find they cannot do so.  Is the Government in charge when it comes to ensuring access to broadband?  It is time people had access to a facility they so badly need.  I call on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his Green Party colleagues, in particular, to ensure this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">There are other issues that will have an impact on people's lives.  I will focus on those relevant to my own constituency of Tipperary South.  Before Christmas, 150 jobs were lost at the Bulmers cider-making operation in Clonmel.  This was a long-established, successful operation but the company found it difficult to overcome cost and overhead issues.  Last week, 91 jobs in a radiator manufacturing plant were transferred to Wales.  No Minister visited south Tipperary to see at first hand what the workers and their families were enduring.  I did not even see a Minister making a comment on the issue on television.  Why have these jobs been transferred across the water?  Is the Government tuned in to what is happening?  It cannot sit idly by and allow such developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">A new educational facility for Clonmel, the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, TRBDI, was promised some ten years ago.  A small facility was put in place and proposals are before the Department to follow through on this project, but nothing further has happened.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate to the relevant Minister the benefits that could arise for the local community from the TRBDI development.  We will knock on the Minister's door to ensure the college is developed.  I listened to Deputy Byrne speak about all the third level institutions in Dublin which can be accessed by people in County Meath.  People in County Tipperary, however, must travel hundreds of miles to avail of third level education and are then faced with accommodation costs.  Does this represent fair and balanced regional development?</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The figures prove that Tipperary town is one of the poorest in the State.  It is crying out for a bypass.  We were promised by successive Ministers that this project would be included in the roll-out of infrastructural developments.  It is necessary to sift through all the press releases, launches and meeting reports before one discovers this project is only at design stage.  I urge the Government to ensure it is implemented under the next transport plan.  The town badly needs a bypass to assist with its development.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">In view of the job losses in Clonmel, I submitted a parliamentary question last week asking whether the IDA had brought any potential investors to visit sites in County Tipperary in the last 12 months.  I was amazed to discover that the answer was no.  Despite all the meetings in which Government agencies have engaged and the addresses to urban councils and various bodies and authorities, no potential investor has been brought to County Tipperary.  The IDA has 50 acres of land in Clonmel ready to be developed.  In the meantime, jobs are being lost.  Will the Minister invite the IDA to come and see what the people of County Tipperary need?</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  We should focus in the next 12 months on ensuring there will be access to broadband for those who desperately need it.  People are spending an inordinate amount of time logging onto network connections because broadband is not available to them.  Progress is urgently required.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I am pleased to have this opportunity to add my voice to the debate on the Finance Bill 2008 which brings into law the main provisions of the Minister's Budget Statement of last December.  No Finance Bill operates in a vacuum but rather within the economy as it pertains.  There has been much commentary to the effect that the economy of 2008 will be very different from the economy of 2007 which was itself different from that of the heady years of the Celtic tiger.  However, we should note that growth last year was in the region of 4.5% and is predicted to be in the region of 3% this year.  Many economies would be extremely satisfied with growth rates of 3%.  Our economy has grown by some 7% annually, on average, since 1997; a stunning performance.  Some commentators contend that this has been achieved by somehow pumping the economy with money we do not have.  The opposite is the case.  I understand the National Treasury Management Agency reported in recent weeks that the national debt as a proportion of GDP had declined in 2007 from 24% to 23%.  In a year where there was 4.5% growth, therefore, our level of indebtedness decreased by 1%.  This is a level of national debt without parallel throughout the world, with the possible exception of Norway, which is outside the European Union, and Luxembourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">In broad terms, therefore, our economy is in extremely good shape.  However, I caution against complacency.  There have been some job losses and there will be further losses in some areas.  Unfortunately, it is an aspect of the global economy that jobs come and go at a quicker rate than heretofore.  That is why it is all the more important that people have access to training and upskilling at every opportunity in order that they can be adaptable and flexible.  The old notion of a job for life may no longer be relevant.  In many of the more developed countries people change jobs with greater fluidity.  There is a greater willingness in this country, especially in the public service, to employ people from different sectors and for people from the public service to move into the private sector.  There are serious competitive issues, which I will address later.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">By and large, we should acknowledge that the Irish economy is in very good shape, although we should not be complacent.  There are, however, many media pundits who seem to make a perpetual living out of talking down the economy.  I have no problem with serious constructive criticism and with people pointing out that the glass may be half empty and not half full.  However, to state that by the end of the year, the glass will be entirely empty is almost irresponsible.  These are peddlers of pessimism and they seem to operate with impunity day in, day out in order to sell their newspaper or to increase the ratings of their radio or television shows.  If they are proved wrong by the end of this year, will they write articles and make television shows admitting that?</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I am prepared to live with the forecast the Minister for Finance gave in his budget speech.  He said that GDP growth this year would be 3%, that we would create 24,000 new jobs and that inflation would be at 2.4%.  I am prepared to predict that will happen this year and to come into this House and eat humble pie if it turns out not to be the case in December.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">My constituents will also have the chance to hold me accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">There is no doubt that one of the main issues in regard to this economy is competitiveness.  I join forces with those on both sides of the House who have urged the Government to address this issue with even more vigour than it has done heretofore.  I refer to some areas in which this needs to be done.  The cost of services is unacceptable, whether for communications, broadcasting or energy.  I agree with the remarks of Deputy Tom Hayes in regard to broadband.  The simple solution is competition.  It is time we broke down the barriers.  We still have restrictive regimes in regard to broadcasting, energy and communications.  Let us shake away those shackles and bring real competition to those sectors.  The only future for Ireland as an economy is as a competitive one operating at the top of the food chain and not at the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I also support further and deeper regional development.  For too long the attitude of the IDA and other agencies has been that Dublin is the only show in town, and I say that as a former Lord Mayor of Dublin.  That is a recipe for disaster and we need to further develop all of the regions.  In that regard, the case Waterford Institute of Technology makes for full university status should be supported.  I would like to see more institutions from Dublin being sent down the country.  I am happy that the regionalisation programme of this Government is succeeding.  I have tried on behalf of several constituents to get their jobs moved out of Dublin, although unsuccessfully because many of the projects have been oversubscribed.  I found the comments of Deputy Richard Bruton a little disappointing in that he failed to acknowledge the success this programme has been.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I agree with some of the comments of Deputy Michael Ring on semi-State agencies, quangos etc., although not with the way they were made.  However, he forgot to say that the Minister indicated in his budget speech that there would be an efficiency review of all Departments, which should report back by 1 March.  I ask the Minister that the efficiency review is published and sent to a joint Oireachtas committee to see which of the State agencies can be amalgamated and which are absolutely essential.  I have no doubt that some of them have duplicative functions, some can be amalgamated and some may be beyond their sell by date.  We must do all we can at all stages to reduce the taxation burden on this economy so that we can remain as competitive as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This year will probably be a difficult one on the international economic horizon but whatever we do, we must not raise taxation because that would only hinder our competitiveness.  We should encourage entrepreneurs from all over the world to come to Ireland, which we have not done very successfully so far.  One way to make that happen is to make our visa system quicker and more transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I support what the Minister has done in regard to stamp duty.  We also need education reform.  However, if the Government stays within its programme as outlined in the budget and in this Bill, we can have much prosperity in this country for many years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I thank Deputy Mulcahy for sharing time.  I wish to take up the point he and the previous speaker raised in regard to economic commentators talking down our economy.  From my recollection, some economic commentators have been doing that for the past five years.  I suppose if one keeps trying to talk it down every year, at some stage along the way one will probably be at least partially right.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">While we are experiencing a slow down in our economy, it is a slowdown from a situation where we experienced growth of 4.8% in 2007.  This year the Minister for Finance has forecast growth in the region of 3%.  It is very important that we put this into context.  Watching many programmes on the economic outlook for 2008 over recent weeks, one would think this country was on the verge of a recession which is far from the reality.  There is no point, however, talking up the economy if the fundamentals are not there to support it.  The success we have achieved, particularly over the past ten years, is acknowledged by other European countries and further afield, although for some reason we are not prepared to do so.  Ireland as an economy is the envy of all other European countries.  That has not happened by accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Other speakers said the Government is quite willing to take all the praise when the economy is booming but is not prepared to take on the responsibility when it is moving into a slowdown.  The Opposition has never acknowledged the fact we have enjoyed wonderful economic growth for the past ten years because of the sound economic polices brought forward by the Government, which I applaud.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">We are seeing a weakness in the property market.  There have been significant losses, particularly in the area of construction, not only in my constituency but throughout the country.  It must also be borne in mind that over the past number of years, we have relied on thousands of people coming from abroad to satisfy the demand for workers in this sector.  We are coming from an all-time high and we are now seeing a slowdown in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">However, other areas and sectors in the economy are performing extremely well, particularly in the area of service exports, which continues to expand and shows great potential for the years ahead.  As I said, this is down to sensible economic policies being practised by the Government and also a pro-business attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I am delighted that this week we are focusing on what the people want us to focus on, that is, the economy and building confidence in it.  These issues are relevant to the people and not some of the nonsense which has been discussed in this House over the past week.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Over the years Ireland has built a reputation as being a very attractive location for foreign investment.  I am particularly conscious of this in my constituency in Mayo, where a number of major international companies employ 3,000 people and have more than €3 billion in exports every year.  I am referring to companies like Allergan, which has just celebrated 30 years in the county, companies like Baxter, which has just announced an investment of €150 million, and other companies like Coca Cola.  However, it is important that the economic environment is conducive to protect these jobs for the future.  For example, Allergan announced the loss of 350 jobs in Wicklow recently.  It is critically important that we do not take for granted the jobs that have been there for more than 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Government should respond to the needs of these industries.  While it is our job to try to attract new jobs into the country, it is critically important that we try to hold on to existing jobs.  These jobs will only be supported by improved infrastructure in the regions.  I have been critical in the past about the underspend on the BMW region, especially under the last national development plan.  While some improvements have been made in this area, I am very conscious that over the next five years, massive investment in the regions along the west of Ireland must be put in place to address this imbalance that has occurred and to protect the growth and the jobs there against the odds.  The Government must be responsive to the needs of these industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The types of projects I am talking about include the development of the N5.  While there have been improvements in that road in the past few years, there is a 25 km stretch going through County Roscommon that is absolutely outrageous in this day and age.  While I acknowledge that the motorways in the country are important, we cannot tolerate the starving of some parts of the country of valuable road infrastructure and thereby affecting industry.  The money must be found.  The N5 from Castlebar to Westport was a priority with the NRA seven or eight years ago, but it has slipped off the radar completely without even a date for construction.  The N26 has a date for construction of 2010 and is the only national road in Mayo with a date for construction.  There is nothing for the next three years, which is unacceptable.  When we talk about balanced regional development, it affects all the counties in the region.  We should not be leaving some of the counties untouched.  The Ballinrobe bypass is not even on the radar of the NRA at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am delighted that the western rail corridor has found favour with the Government, but it should be fast-tracked even further.  The train service to the west is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable that there are no canteen facilities on many days on the trains.  It is not acceptable that the train from Westport comes into the worst platform in Heuston Station, where people, many of them elderly, must walk the length of a long platform to get on to a train.  All the trains to other parts of the country go from the immediate platform within the station.  Why has that been the case for the past ten years?  Why can they not be rotated?  There are obviously not enough platforms for all the trains, but this is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I acknowledge the successes of our economy.  In the past ten years there has been an average growth rate of 7%, which is one of the best performances of any country throughout the world.  Employment has grown by 4% per annum over the past ten years and we are now in a situation where we have immigration into the country rather than emigration from it.  It resulted in a great economic success and allowed the Government to increase public spending without putting a strain on public finances.  We have seen major developments in the export sector, especially in the area of financial services, IT and chemicals.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I agree with the Minister's speech that the key areas to be addressed are human, capital, infrastructure, regulatory and public service reform, the maintenance of stable public finances and a pro-business tax system.  These are the areas on which we must focus.  I know that the Government is investing in third and fourth level education and I welcome that.  However, I draw the Minister's attention to two projects I would like to see advanced in my constituency.  Davitt College needs a sports hall and it is important that we look after the sporting activities of our education sector and not just the academic interests, especially given the fight against obesity.  Davitt College has been looking for a sports hall for 30 years.  The school was promised the hall 18 months ago.  A commitment was given by the Minister, but it did not appear on the list of schools undergoing construction projects.  I am confident it will appear on the list later this year, but it is a project that must be prioritised, as does the project for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche in Westport, which was also expected to be on that list.  From speaking to the Minister, I am optimistic that it will appear on the list after Easter.  These are priorities because education is critical if we are to maintain a skilled workforce in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I mentioned the issue of infrastructural investment and I ask that the regional balance be upheld.  I welcome some of the measures in the Bill, especially the changes to corporation tax aimed at small and start-up companies.  These changes will make life a lot easier and there will be a smaller administrative burden for many businesses.  I acknowledge the increases in the VAT registration thresholds, especially for small businesses in services and goods.  I also welcome the extension of film relief.  The Minister has increased the cap from €35 million to €50 million for investments in films, but it is a very valuable measure and will hopefully encourage further investments in films in this country.  There is also a valuable individual relief for people who invest up to €31,750 — they will get 80% relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Section 41 of the Finance Act has brought in new measures on petroleum.  This is for gas and oil explorations and it introduces a new resource rent tax on companies that received licences after 1 January 2007.  This is particularly relevant in my constituency, where we had a very valuable find in the Corrib gas field off the Mayo coast and where many complained that the Government take in this kind of exploration was not as good as it should be.  I acknowledge the measures introduced last year by the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the fact that these measures have been given effect in the Finance Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">The Finance Bill is the most important Bill that is debated in this Chamber.  It is about how the Government decides to spend taxpayers'<b> </b>money and it affects everybody.  There are very few Bills about which one can say that.  I listened to the Government Deputies and while I agree with some of what they said, I would probably place a different emphasis on the Finance Bill and how we approach it as public representatives.  Deputy Mulcahy stated that the economy is the envy of the world and is much admired.  I cannot disagree with that and we have had enough delegations from different countries asking us how exactly we did it.  I do not think anybody knows exactly how we did it, but I feel it was a combination of factors and things coming together at a particular time in the world economy that gave us our boom.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">Exactly.  While many of those people admire the economy, the same people are taken aback at what we have done with the boom and the fact that we still have an education system that is less than half way up the OECD table.  I have heard that if someone were to land from Mars and walk into one of our overcrowded school prefabs or trolley-ridden accident and emergency departments, he or she might believe it was a Third World country.  What has been done with the enormous boon that landed in the Government's lap is abysmal.  We will regret it and the people will not be as forgiving as the backbenchers in Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">This Government has been in power for the past ten years.  It should have presided over an economy that created the type of services the country deserves, which, in fairness, we did not have the resources to put in place for a long time.  However, we have had the resources for the past ten years, yet we have a health service that is not just inefficient and ineffectual but in some instances downright dangerous.  One would be reluctant to have a surgical procedure in some hospitals.  The register of people dying from hospital acquired infections in time will show us how reluctant we should have been and that should be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">People now decide where they are going to live based on what they can afford, not on where their families or the best services are located.  Again, that is something the Government could have controlled, but it did not do so.  They allowed matters let rip with the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, effectively saying "party on".  We have been brought to this state because of a lack of control over the economy and how services were put in place.  There are now areas in the country that do not have sufficient spaces for children to go to school, despite the fact that young people get married and housing estates are built.  It does not take a rocket scientist to realise that after children are born, they will need to go to school within a few years, yet we put enormous housing estates in place with no facilities and no transport systems, features normal developed communities expect.  This did not happen at a time when the money was available to do it and that is outrageous.  We can talk about a 3% growth rate being something the rest of the world envies.  That is absolutely correct, but what they do not envy is our scandalous provision of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I want to tell the House what I was doing today for an hour and a half.  I went from Billy to Jack in every Department that could possibly have anything to do with the provision of house alarms for the elderly.  The Finance Bill is about growth rates, the super-economy, job creation, etc., but equally it is about the provision of services to the people.  There are niggardly little cuts during budgets which are never seen until we go looking for something.  The Government no longer funds alarms for the homes of the elderly, who now feel more insecure in their communities than they did five years ago.  A scheme was in place, which was administered by the Department of Social Welfare, now the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but it has gone.  It was hived off to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and we all know what happens when things go there.  They tend to disappear into the mire, off to an island somewhere or into the mists of time.  It no longer exists.  Elderly people are looking to have their houses alarmed and they cannot get this done now because that is one of the cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">As in all debates in this House we must always talk about our individual constituencies.  Cork North Central lost a seat in the last reshuffle by the commission because its population is down.  Everyone accepts this; that is the way of the world — it is how the Constitution is written.  It lost that seat because the population does not exist to support five Dáil Deputies and because it does not have the infrastructure to support the population.  It is as simple as that.  Cork North Central and Cork South Central have always been extremely good to Fianna Fáil.  However, Fianna Fáil in this Government has not been good to Cork and particularly to Cork North Central.  It does not have a ring road, which is needed for access.  It does not have the rehabilitation unit which was promised for the site of St. Mary's orthopaedic hospital nearly eight years ago.  Every public representative can confirm that he or she gets phone calls at least three times a year from people whose loved ones are waiting on a bed at Dún Laoghaire rehabilitation hospital but cannot get one because they are not available.  We desperately need another unit, in the south of the country, but it has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">There is not a penny, paragraph or bullet point in the Finance Bill about the future of the docklands project in Cork.  The Dublin Docklands Authority has been in place for the past ten years, and longer.  I believe the rainbow Government put it in place, but there is nothing for the docklands in Cork, which is pivotal as regards how the city develops.  There is no light rail system to the airport.  Indeed, there is no relief for the airport in fulfilment of the promise made by a Minister in writing — which is quite unusual for this Government.  He promised that when Cork Airport disconnected from the Dublin Airport Authority, it would be debt-free.  All of a sudden that could not happen, but by that time the election was over and there was a change of Minister.  It is pivotal for the development of Cork Airport that it disconnects from Dublin Airport Authority, but it cannot do so with the type of debt it now has to carry, yet there is not one word.   Surely the Government must realise that the imbalance that has occurred in this country is the result of lack of development and investment in areas outside Dublin.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_621">I thank Deputy Kathleen Lynch for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">This is not an innovative Finance Bill by any stretch of the imagination.  To my mind, it does not signal that the Minister for Finance is up to the challenge presented by the current economic circumstances.  There have been a number of significant worrying developments since the budget was announced at the start of December, some of which I will outline.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The Central Bank has predicted that the downturn in construction will mean the loss of 23,000 building jobs this year alone.  The Exchequer surplus was a mere €630 million in January, down from €1.7 billion in January 2007.  The number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose in January at the fastest pace since 1980.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has warned that a recession in the US would inflict significant damage on the Irish economy.  There has been a string of job losses over the past two months, including most recently 350 at Allergen, based in Arklow, County Wicklow, 200 at the Jacob Fruitfield factory in Tallaght, 240 at Dawn Meats in Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon, and just last week it was announced that 130 jobs at Grove Turkeys in Smithborough, County Monaghan, in my constituency, were also to be axed.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Repossessions are rising while falling house prices push those who borrowed at the height of the boom into a negative equity scenario.  Recent rises in interest rates have also made it difficult for many homeowners to meet repayments.  All of that paints a very gloomy picture indeed in this, the first week of February 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">As economic growth forecasts are revised downwards, the challenge for the Minister for Finance and the Government is to ensure the revenue is there to provide for public services and that necessary interventions are made to stem job losses while creating alternative employment.  This can and must be done but what is required is the political will at Government level to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The economic difficulties which we now face were, at least in part, avoidable.  The Government failed to address the issue of declining competitiveness.  Indeed, some of its actions significantly contributed to the loss of competitiveness, including the failure to roll out needed infrastructure fast enough and the privatisation of Eircom which detrimentally retarded the roll-out of broadband.  In relation to that, may I say that, like many other Deputies I have been contacted by a whole raft of people from different walks of life for whom their particular job, function, whatever, is seriously impaired by the absence of broadband accessibility in their respective areas.  I have had representations from County Cavan and County Monaghan in recent weeks and I know that is replicated in other parts of the country.  That is a hugely important issue.  What has happened in terms of the failure to roll out broadband, as promised, is absolutely criminal because people have made commitments to work from home, something that was encouraged for years.  Now they find the situation untenable and cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The construction sector was allowed to become over inflated and the economy over-reliant on that sector.  There has been a clear absence of intervention to retrain vulnerable workers, particularly in the construction sector where, according to the Higher Education Authority, 80,000 workers have only a second level education.  The Government sleep-walked into this situation.  While others were recognising the serious vulnerabilities in the Irish economy, this Government and this Minister for Finance were insisting that everything was going fine.  They deemed those who raised legitimate concerns about the state of the economy to be merchants of doom and such a charge was thrown back at us across this Chamber repeatedly in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Despite repeated warnings that the boom could not last indefinitely as the State slipped down competitiveness rankings and as trouble brewed in the US economy, this Government did nothing.  Despite numerous calls from the trade union movement and others for action on training and upskilling, nothing was done to protect vulnerable workers who are now losing their jobs.  Nothing was done to fast track the roll-out of infrastructure and to stop the decline in competitiveness.  The provisions in this Bill will not be enough to address the extent to which this State continues to lag behind other EU states in terms of research and development capacity within enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The poor state of public services after more than a decade of this Government, in particular in the health system, has also contributed to the erosion of competitiveness.  Our public transport system is totally inadequate with Dublin and other urban centres suffering from crippling gridlock that is hurting business, undermining competitiveness and leading to a very negative quality of life situation for so many people and destroying the quality of life of those forced to commute.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The Government's failure to plan for the future of the economy will have serious consequences for the Exchequer.  Tax revenue across a range of taxes is down while the burden on the social insurance fund is set to rise as a consequence of the increased number of redundancies and a growing level of unemployment.  The social insurance fund needs to be able to cope with these increased demands and for that reason it is crucial that there are no cuts in PRSI contributions into the social insurance fund.  Neither has there been any measure to address the expansion of low-paid employment, something which has serious long-term consequences for the tax take, both in terms of income tax revenue and revenue from spending taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">We are still waiting for the proposed commission on taxation to be established.  What is the delay?  Perhaps we might get some indication of that in the Minister's response to Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  The proposed commission on taxation must be established now and set the task of determining the best way to fundamentally restructure the tax system to create a progressively distributive tax system through which revenue is raised in a fair, transparent and accountable manner in order that the Exchequer has the revenue needed to reduce inequalities, improve public services and deliver infrastructure.  That is the task of Government first and foremost.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">It is time the Minister for Finance outlined what action the Government is to take to put the economy back on a solid foundation and ensure we regain competitiveness.  This Bill should have set the tone for the Government's approach but it does not.  A further challenge arises from the fact that decisions on interest rates and exchange rates are now under the control of the European Central Bank.  Never has a state been so limited in its ability to respond to its individual economic situation.  Considerable economic sovereignty has been ceded to the European Union and what the ECB does in the best interests of the EU as a whole or in the interests of larger states such as Germany and France may not be in the best interest of Ireland.  With our particular vulnerability to developments in the United States, we may find ourselves in a different economic situation from the states of mainland Europe with different approaches needed but none possible because we have ceded the opportunity to respond appropriately and in our patent interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">There are measures in the Bill that are to be welcomed.  Sinn Féin welcomes the new measures to tax the profits of exploration companies exploiting our natural resources, although these do not go far enough.  We are also concerned that this tax will not apply to exploration licences granted before 2007.  Sinn Féin welcomes the overdue reduction in the rate of VAT on non-oral contraceptives from 21% to 13.5%.  We also welcome the fact that those on the average industrial wage are to be kept within the standard tax band and that unsustainable tax cutting proposals have not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">At a time when Irish pension funds lost €9 billion in value between the end of June and the end of November 2007, we would have liked to see reform of the excessively generous tax incentives for private pension savings which disproportionately benefited a wealthy minority.  The cost of tax breaks has soared in recent years and has not been effective in ensuring full pension coverage, particularly among the least well off.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">While this Bill contains measures to promote energy efficient technology among businesses, we would have liked to see the inclusion of an innovative scheme to assist the low income households to insulate their homes and to install sustainable heating alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">On the other issues, on amendments and proposals that we may be able to put forward that might not be disallowed on the basis of affecting the Exchequer returns, we look forward to the opportunities presented on Committee and Report Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the Finance Bill, which is welcome.  It introduces supports for business, makes the tax system fairer and lightens the burden on low and middle-income earners.  The principal aims of the Bill are to support enterprise and innovation, to advance sustainable development and ensure a fair tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">As a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Finance I welcome these moves.  In particular, I welcome the continuing trend of supporting small and medium sized business.  Small and medium sized businesses account for up to 40% of the Irish workforce and represent a vital component of the economy, but not just the economy.  It is also important to the social infrastructure in the communities across Dublin and the country.  Operating both domestically and internationally, small and medium industries provide invaluable goods and services in support of larger industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Today, Dublin City Enterprise Board came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  One of the biggest challenges facing the enterprise board was the lack of space for its start-up businesses.  One way of solving the problem of lack of space for start-up businesses would be to let entrepreneurs listen to the Opposition because that would certainly deaden any enthusiasm an entrepreneur would have for starting a business.  Thankfully, entrepreneurs do not listen to the Opposition, which is why we have a healthy and strong economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">Only today, the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced a €60 million growth fund operated by Enterprise Ireland which will help secure new jobs in Irish firms.  The fund will support investments in staff, equipment and technology in order to increase competitiveness and encourage new exports.  Such supports are to be welcomed, particularly in a more competitive environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The Finance Bill helps SMEs by reducing the administrative burden and making doing business easier.  The Bill provides for measures to assist small businesses which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, introduced in last year's budget.  It includes a number of business-friendly measures such as revised preliminary tax payment arrangements for corporation tax aimed at small and start-up companies and an increase in VAT registration thresholds for small business to €37,500 in the case of services and €75,000 in the case of goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">This Bill represents a range of business-friendly measures which will support continued growth and job creation in a climate of economic uncertainty.  Within Europe, Ireland is third in a league of countries that encourage start-up businesses, which shows that Irish people embrace challenges and change, and are adaptable to change.  This is why we have continued to progress so well.  The Bill will support those who want to take a chance to improve their lives and the life of the community in which they live and work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_648">One of the ways in which the Bill protects the less well-off in society is by creating a fairer tax system.  The Social Welfare Bill made significant improvements to social welfare payments, including pensions and carer's allowance, among other measures.  The Finance Bill aims to reward those at work.  It does so by giving increases in personal tax credits and tax bands to ensure that low income earners are kept out of the standard rate band and average earners are kept out of the higher rate band.  Tax credits have been increased for the elderly, lone parents, widowed persons, including widowed parents, and those with a disability or those who care for a person with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Those who wish to get their first step on the property ladder should now find it considerably easier due to the changes, which include further increases in the ceilings up to which first-time buyers can claim mortgage interest relief and substantial reform of the stamp duty regime for residential property.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_651">The old system has been replaced by an exemption of €125,000, a 7% rate on the next €875,000 and a 9% rate on sums above that.  A measure which is often overlooked but which will create more flexibility for individuals is the reduction in the stamp duty claw-back provision for new residences and for first-time buyers from five to two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Bill also prioritises the environment.  Practical measures are necessary to help protect our economy and environment.  A new tax initiative for energy efficient equipment will allow companies to claim the full cost, in the year of purchase, of specified energy efficient equipment against their taxable income.  The purpose is to assist in improving cost competitiveness while helping to reduce overall energy demand and carbon emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Bill provides for a fundamental reform of the vehicle registration system.  It will provide the opportunity for people to make choices to help the environment and provide financial incentives to do so.  The VRT system is being revised to take greater account of carbon dioxide emissions, with VRT exemption for series production electric cars and up to €2,500 VRT relief for certain series production hybrid and flexible fuel cars.  Over time, this will have to change and become more finely tuned.  This is the first step in having the economy and the environment work more closely together.  People recognise the benefits.  The green agenda has moved to centre stage.  Fianna Fáil and the Greens have recognised this and we are now putting it into practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">In summary, I welcome the Bill because it supports small and medium enterprises, which are and will continue to be the linchpin of our economy.  It provides a fairer tax system, which benefits lower income earners, and it provides financial incentives to protect the environment, which will provide for future generations.  In an uncertain world economy, it is vital that we continue to strive for a balance that encourages enterprise and protects the less well-off in society.  This is exactly what the Bill does, which is why I support it.</p>

A previous speaker suggested the Minister missed an opportunity and did not pay attention to the real situation but he did precisely that.  He was fully conscious of the new and changed environment and it was in that light that he set the budget and Finance Bill.  He recognised that in 2008 the economy would not grow as it had grown in previous years and his target was a gross rate of 3%.</p>

We do not have a destiny in which we can ride the waves and buck the trend, yet our growth rate is one that many of our European partners and others would strongly envy.  We are anticipating a growth rate of 3% this year and it is in that context that the budget and Finance Bill were framed.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Members have spoken of redundancies, which are regrettable.  However, in the next 12 months we are planning for a real growth in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">At a time when he was facing a tough budgetary challenge, the Minister should be complimented that he did not do what some commentators and others might have done in taking the easy option by cutting back on the capital budget.  Capital investment during the current year is at €8.6 billion and at a time when there are real challenges to other industries our investment programme must be delivered not only for employment, but also to ensure the necessary infrastructure is delivered.  The Minister made that commitment and, while running a deficit in Government spending this year, is maintaining the necessary roll-out of investment to provide that infrastructure.  When other industries may be struggling, he will also provide the employment opportunities that come with an expenditure of €8.6 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">The Finance Bill as presented does a lot to facilitate business.  I am pleased to see some aspects which will help to encourage the establishment of small businesses in particular.  One specific change concerns corporation tax whose threshold has been raised from €150,000 to €200,000 for small companies.  The VAT rate increase thresholds have also been raised to €37,500 for services and €75,000 for goods.  When times were good and things were booming here, nobody needed to take a chance in establishing their own businesses, and these types of supports were welcome.  A former Deputy from Tipperary, Noel Davern, was always a strong advocate of assisting and encouraging small indigenous business by cutting red tape as far as possible.  The Minister has proceeded along those lines in this budget by removing bureaucratic red tape to enable individuals to establish small businesses.  Some of the moves the Minister has made in that regard are to be commended because they will help such businesses to get up and running.</p>

It is easy for people to pick snippets from the budget and praise the provisions concerning cars, but the Minister also changed business practice by encouraging that sector to invest in equipment.  The specific change there is that the purchase of environmentally friendly and efficient equipment can be written off in one year whereas normally it would take five or seven years.  The figures vary according to the type of equipment but the green environmental issue is fairly dominant in the Finance Bill.</p>

Not alone did the Minister reduce costs for first-time buyers but he also brought certainty to the stamp duty issue.  I acknowledge that interest rates have risen.  However, anyone who is considering purchasing a home to live in, rather than an investment property, given the current reduction in house prices and stamp duty, it is probably cheaper to buy a house now than it has been for a long time.  Opposition Members may talk about negative equity and the fall in property values over time, but if one can afford to buy a house as a home over the longer period, now is probably as good a time as any to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I am not disputing that but I said if one could afford it, it is probably a good time to purchase and people in that position should be encouraged to do so.  People often say that house prices will drop but that is a sentiment and in the meantime they are paying rent.  However, affordability is now better for first-time buyers due to lower stamp duty, mortgage interest relief and the fall in property prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I do not want to avoid the question of inflation which has been an issue of concern.  In the budget, the Minister made specific changes in that regard.  On budget day, the issue of tobacco tariffs and smoking arose, and we should seek to achieve a consensus on this matter not only in this House but among the social partners also.  Many people argue on health grounds that the price of cigarettes should be increased significantly to act as an effective deterrent.  However, there is a problem in doing that because cigarettes still form part of the consumer price index so if we increase their price to a deterrent level it would adversely affect the inflation rate.  We should examine how our inflation rate is measured and what is in the basket of goods that determines the CPI.  That system has been in place for a long time but I am not sure if it is exactly the same as that used in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Representatives of the Revenue Commissioners are frequent visitors to the Committee of Public Accounts where we have interesting debates on a range of issues.  The budget concerns Government expenditure, including social welfare spending.  One of the concerns I have as a public representative is that there is still a lack of joined-up thinking between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  People still attend my constituency office who are paying tax but are in receipt of an inappropriate social welfare payment.  I would like to see an automated system whereby people could not inadvertently accrue significant debts.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">We will follow your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle.  The budget of 2008, which we discussed here last December, missed the target on many aspects.  Like every other budget, and I have been around for many of them, it was like the  curate's egg, good in parts.  There was one overarching aspect of the budget that everybody thought they knew about.  Nobody told the Minister for Finance in December 2007 that we were in for a hard year in 2008 because not an economist in Europe could see it coming.  The problem goes back to the Celtic tiger.  I was in this House in the late 1970s and 1980s when it was not an inspiring place to be because we did not have the Exchequer resources that became available in the late 1990s and afterwards.  The Government stands indicted, however, because no provision was made for a rainy day, good, bad or indifferent.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">For a while, the Government thought the sun would shine all the time.  It is very easy to be a good Minister for Finance when the Exchequer returns for the current year are greater than the previous year, which was the case for the past seven or eight years.  However, the problem is every commentator who appeared on television over the past 12 months following the closure of a factory's gates and people losing their jobs said the reason is Ireland has lost its competitive edge.  They cannot all be wrong.  We must whip our costs into line to ensure job creation.  For example, the costs of haulage, electricity and broadband and port charges must be managed much better than in the past.  Other countries can do so and their cost base is lower as a result.  At the end of the day, we can have all the argy bargy we like in the House but I will judge this year's budget on whether Ireland can compete where it counts most, which is in the jobs market.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Bill contains nice provisions, which will make it easier for small business, but the overall problem is the Government parties missed many wonderful opportunities over the past five years.  The Minister of State was very vocal as leader of his party when in Opposition about the squander mania on the roads.  I recall the announcement of the national development plan, under which €6.5 billion was allocated for the roads programme, but it will cost €20 billion by the time it is completed.  Somebody got his or her figures extraordinarily wrong.  Would the Government not build many hospitals for €12.5 billion?  It is like selling the family silver.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">There is no better organisation in Europe than Fianna Fáil for spin doctoring and getting a message across, whether it is right or wrong, to suits its need on a particular day, except on this occasion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_716">That is not what I said.  Many people are beginning to wonder why in the run-up to the 2007 election the party stated there might be a slowdown and even if economic growth reduced from 7% to 3% or less, it could still take many initiatives.  However, the Government cannot do a great deal if economic growth is only 2.8% or 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I refer to small issues around the country.  For instance, I tabled two parliamentary questions recently about two schools in Cathair Geal, Tuam, and Aughrim, Ballinasloe, in my constituency.  I never received such a gobbledegook reply as that from the Minister for Education and Science.  The schools are being considered in the context of the multiannual budget, which was the case five years ago.  I refer to the proposed amalgamations of Presentation College and the Mercy Convent in Tuam as well as St. Jarlath's College and St. Patrick's College.  Ten years ago all the stakeholders, including teachers and unions, reached agreement on these projects but sites have still not been acquired.  These are examples of the lack of delivery at ground level.  The budget does not provide any hope for these projects over the next few years even though they have been around forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Pollution control is an issue for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The sewerage scheme in my home village of Mountbellew is outdated and everyone has known this for years.  It is polluting the local River Shiven.  Only last week An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission to a developer to build a number of houses and a shopping centre but inserted a clause preventing him from commencing the development until a new sewerage scheme has been built in the village.  I contacted the Department about the file on this and it could well be another four or five years ago before the scheme happens.  Such projects must be considered in the context of the budget and the infrastructure it will create.  The Tánaiste can talk in global terms all he likes but it is what happens on the ground that counts.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I refer to the moneys allocated to the Department of Education and Science in the budget.  Most of the new schools building projects are located in Dublin or on the east coast.  I cannot understand why the summer works scheme was abolished.  Many small schools availed of it to carry out rewiring, replace roofs and carry out other external works.  The Department went to the trouble last September of asking school boards of management to make applications for the 2008 scheme.  Engineers and so on were retained to send in the applications but a unilateral decision was taken to abolish the scheme a few months ago.  That does not represent joined-up thinking or consistency in policy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Bill has been presented to the House as Ireland enters a tough period in competitiveness and economic growth.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance referred to Ireland as being on top of the world and the best place to do business at this time.  He ignores the fact that people are losing their jobs throughout the State and business is declining in all sectors, including services and construction.  People's livelihoods are being seriously threatened.  Over the past ten years the Minister for Finance did not have to worry about these issues but today a working couple cannot afford to pay a mortgage, despite the additional mortgage interest relief provided in the budget, which is welcome.  However, it is insufficient to meet the needs of these couples because they bought a house without realising the downturn was imminent.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The number of house repossessions granted by the courts is increasing by the day.  That is a tragedy for young couples starting their lives.  The onus is on the Tánaiste to substantially adjust the supports for young couples and it is essential that he realises these matters were not on the horizon when the budget was announced in December.  I hope he amends the legislation to support young couples who have purchased houses and begun repayments when times were good but who now find themselves in serious trouble.  Adjustments are particularly necessary where one partner has lost a job or is in part-time employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Many aspects of the budget are acceptable.  Deputy Curran referred to supports for small enterprises, which are welcome.  However, we have to realise that we will no longer see major foreign direct investment by multinational companies such as Dell.  These companies are relocating part of their operations to lower cost economies while retaining research and development in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The provision in the 2006 budget of a tax incentive scheme for tourism projects in the mid-Shannon region was welcome.  It was more or less a parallel of the pilot scheme in the upper Shannon region which resulted in significant improvements in places such as Carrick-on-Shannon and surrounding communities.  The provisions announced in the 2006 budget had benefits for parts of the Tánaiste's constituency.  However, I have tried without success to ascertain the guidelines and criteria for the scheme.  I was told when I was in the other House that they would be made available shortly.  I raised the issue in the Dáil last June through a parliamentary question and more recently on the Adjournment but was given the same response.  When I sought application forms I was told they were not available and there has been no agreement from Brussels regarding the scheme's acceptability and guidelines.  We do not know the guidelines, so how can Brussels adjudicate on them?  In addition, there is no interdepartmental agreement on the scheme.  If a scheme initiated by the Minister for Finance is not agreed to by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, is that not unacceptable?  We enthusiastically embraced the scheme and looked forward to the benefits it would bring to areas of Galway East such as Portumna, Woodford and Eyrecourt, which are not blessed with many tourist attractions, but nothing has happened.  If it is a matter of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism wanting more than the Department of Finance is willing to give, it is time somebody made a decision because 15 months after the scheme's introduction, people are still prevented from using it to improve their incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The three main aims of this Bill are supporting enterprise and innovation, advancing sustainable development and ensuring a fairer tax system.  In a Finance Bill containing 200 pages of new tax legislation, it is critical that tax policies are used in a creative way to maintain our competitive position and sustain economic growth.  However, some of the Bill's provisions will not meet these requirements.  I welcome the support for small businesses to meet their VAT and corporation tax obligations by eliminating red tape.  It is important that our tax code makes it easier for businesses to operate and incentivises sectors such as energy.  The Bill provides for tax breaks on environmentally friendly activities and establishes the new commission on taxation.  I welcome the incentives for businesses that invest in green equipment but these schemes need careful monitoring to prevent abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Tánaiste revealed that some companies based in the International Financial Services Centre see significant opportunities for expanding their operations into carbon trading, particularly in the context of EU plans for an enhanced emissions trading scheme.  Companies will be able to buy and sell so-called carbon credits, which essentially give permission to emit a certain amount of carbon.  The current emissions trading scheme has been subject to criticism but it is likely to become more widespread and lucrative in the future once carbon becomes a widely traded commodity.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The Government's failure to date to meet our Kyoto targets will be very expensive.  According to figures released by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, between €150 million and €325 million will leave the country over the next five years to pay for carbon credits in order to offset this failure.  This money would be better spent at home on technologies and projects which can reduce our emissions.  The EU announced last month that we will have to make a 20% reduction on the 2005 emissions figure by 2020.  The trading in carbon credits represents an opportunity for our financial services sector but, given our terrible record in reducing emissions, we are no more likely than any other country to profit and any benefits from financial services will be marginal compared to the enormous sums of money being spent on our failure to meet the Kyoto targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">In the current climate, many industries and small, medium and large businesses may be experiencing temporary financial difficulties and it is important the Revenue Commissioners are lenient and accept that such difficulties exist.  The Revenue often demonstrated flexibility in the past and put in place proper programmes in respect of the repayment of arrears.  I suggest that it adopt a policy aimed at facilitating people in this regard in the short term.  This would allow viable industries to remain in operation and to continue to provide employment.  There must be an element of understanding and the Revenue should, as it has previously, adopt a policy of accommodation, particularly when, with its agreement, proper repayment plans are put in place.</p>

I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent.  I am sure he is delighted that he has recently been the subject of all sorts of attention and has received much kudos.  This shows that the Green Party, in government, is clearly doing its job.

          <p eId="para_732">When the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, introduced the Finance Bill, he pointed out that it is based on sound fiscal policies to encourage economic growth while promoting care for the environment and protecting the less well-off in our society.  He also stated that the Bill contains a range of business-friendly measures that will support continued growth and job creation in a climate of economic slowdown and that various measures in it are aimed at combating tax avoidance and criminal tax activity.  He further stated that it is the fifth Finance Bill he has introduced.  The Tánaiste was speaking my language.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I do not want to draw out the Opposition or upset my good friend, Deputy Noonan.  However, many remarks have been made about the performance of the Government and how matters are developing.  I am happy to be a member of a Government party, the members of which have confidence in the ability of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Cowen, to deal with the enormous challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I do not wish to be flippant but someone said to me earlier that if the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were candidates in the American presidential election, they would do well because they have demonstrated their abilities.  When one travels abroad — we have all had the opportunity to do so on occasion — one is struck, even in the current climate, by the manner in which politicians in other jurisdictions point to the success of the Irish economy.  I accept that times are tight and that we face competition, but what has happened with the economy is good for our image.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I co-chaired a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs earlier and I was reminded that the Tánaiste must ensure that proper resources are made available in order to cater for the needs of the vulnerable and disadvantaged.  The Taoiseach used to say — I strongly subscribe to this view — that at all times, even when the economy is doing well but certainly when it is being challenged, it is important that we remember all the boats, particularly the smaller ones.  My predecessor in the constituency I represent, Chris Flood, often made that point in respect of social inclusion.  It is something I have promoted in my community and political work and I will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">I share the concerns expressed by previous speakers with regard to the challenges we will face in the negotiations on pay.  As someone with a trade union background who now has an opportunity to make a contribution in Dáil Éireann, I am of the view that it is important to understand the nature of those challenges.  Difficulties will arise and Members have been subjected to a great deal of lobbying.  Previous speakers referred to the position of agency workers, etc., and I have met delegations from my constituency and representatives of SIPTU to discuss these matters.  It is important that the Tánaiste understands our concerns in this regard and that progress is monitored as the negotiations on pay evolve.  I hope measures will emerge that will take into account the difficulties and challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">On occasions of this nature, I am always aware that I should not refer only to Tallaght and my constituency of Dublin South-West.  However, I have listened to most of the debate on the Bill and previous speakers mentioned almost every town in every county.  I will not, therefore, be sensitive about referring to Tallaght, Templeogue, Greenhills, Firhouse, Brittas or Bohernabreena.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I have no desire to suggest that as I go about my daily business people stop me and state that they want to discuss the Finance Bill.  However, like their counterparts in Finglas and Limerick — to which we sent John Fitzgerald, a man who did good things in Tallaght, to resolve its problems — there are issues which are of concern to them.  Sometimes the Opposition think that Government backbenchers are happy with everything and that they do not have concerns or are not prepared to express such concerns if they do harbour them.  I would not be doing my job if I did not express my concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">There are a number of issues which the Tánaiste must examine.  Previous speakers referred to their constituencies and I am certainly going to refer to the constituency I represent.  I share Deputy Connaughton's concerns regarding the summer works scheme and I am aware the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has been under pressure in that regard.  It should be acknowledged that, over a period, tremendous work has been done in many of our communities, particularly in my constituency, as a result of the scheme, which has provided good value for money.  I appeal to the Tánaiste to check the coffers in order to see what might be done to ensure that funding is again made available in respect of the summer works scheme.  There is no doubt that the scheme was a welcome development throughout the country and my constituency was no different in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I hope the Tánaiste will give consideration to the various issues raised by Members.  I ask him to examine the position of Tallaght community school, which is caught in a bind in the context of trying to redevelop the swimming pool at the local sports complex.  There is some confusion as to whether the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism or South Dublin County Council have responsibility in this regard.  The swimming pool is on the school's property and the school authorities are responsible for it.  It is important that my constituency colleagues and I make the case on the school's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">On a number of previous occasions I referred to hospital services and the position of Tallaght Hospital.  Other Members also referred to such services and to the relationship with the HSE.  I share their concerns.  I have no wish to be parochial but I feel strongly about Tallaght Hospital, the catchment area of which encompasses not only Tallaght — the third largest population centre in the country — but also includes parts of Kildare and extends as far as Carnew in County Wicklow.  I become concerned when I read about the HSE encountering difficulties in attempting to fund services.  I accept that the Tánaiste has a great many matters with which to deal but I am of the view that Members who represent areas in which major hospitals are located should not be afraid to highlight the issue of hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I wish to refer to employment and job creation.  The Tánaiste, through provisions in the Bill, is continuing his policy of creating a situation in which jobs and investment can be attracted to Ireland.  I raised the matter of job losses at Jacob's on the Adjournment last week.  Job losses in Wicklow and elsewhere have taken Tallaght off the map a bit in that regard, although it is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Last week, I stated in the Dáil that I bring to my politics my own experiences.  I have been made redundant three times in my life in different ways but I recovered and I know the trauma of such an experience.  I know it is important to support families and I express solidarity with the people in Wicklow.  There is an issue for me in Tallaght regarding the jobs being lost in Jacob's.  There are 220 full-time jobs and 130 seasonal jobs.  It is reasonable for me as a Tallaght-based Government Deputy to make this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Public representatives will always make a point about their communities, towns, cities and counties but the case for Tallaght is strong.  We have a very young population and we had to deal with challenges such as unemployment over the years.  Since The Square opened on 23 October 1990, things have come on enormously in my community.  We need more job creation rather than job losses so the Minister must continue to introduce policies that will continue to attract investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Cases can be made for everywhere else in the country but I am not afraid to make the case for Tallaght.  As I stated, it is the third largest population centre in the country so it is important I do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">In the context of the Finance Bill, it is important that Departments providing various facilities and services in all our communities continue to be monitored.  I listened to some of the comments of the Opposition regarding the current state of the economy.  I came into town last Saturday on the Luas with my son — I do not normally come in but I was lucky enough to get a ticket to Croke Park — and the city was buzzing.  I came to work this morning again on the Luas.  As Deputy Noonan knows, it is good to walk and I strolled around the city this morning.  There is a genuine impression that people are working and getting into the city as the streets are full of cars.  We may listen to comments of foreboding about the state of the economy but there is still much vibrancy out there.  People are still working and tourists are coming in.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I will not preach but we should not talk down our economy.  We should be clear and continue to understand that good management is very important.  That is the reason I have much confidence in my colleagues, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the other Ministers.  The presence of my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, reminds me that all of us should continue to support the work he does and not only in the drugs area.  Although that is the headline of his responsibility, he also deals with community activity and development.  It is important that the Minister for Finance continues to ensure proper funding in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I heard criticism today of other sections of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs but none of the comments concerning the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was negative.  He is clearly getting the message across to us and I continue to support him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">I hope the Acting Chairman does not mind me mentioning Tallaght again, but I mentioned Limerick a couple of times.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">Without wanting to upset the GAA, this is a soccer night.  I wish I could be let out to go see Ireland playing Brazil tonight, led by the Tallaght man, Robbie Keane.  I was with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Séamus Brennan, last Thursday when he took the opportunity to come to Tallaght to look at the Shamrock Rovers stadium.  That will be a significant boon, not only to Tallaght but to the wider region.  Many people from all over the country, including Limerick, will come to the stadium.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I have listened to colleagues mentioning issues from other constituencies.  It is important that projects such as the Shamrock Rovers stadium is properly funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I will mention another local issue with regard to Government funding, specifically that within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  A comparison is often made, sometimes unfairly, between Tallaght and Limerick.  Limerick apparently has more gardaí and Garda stations as Tallaght only has one station.  All of us would welcome what is happening in Limerick city and county.  In the context of Government finances, there is a significant issue with regard to Garda facilities in Tallaght.  There is a campaign asking whether we need a second Garda station and although the Garda authorities are not quite happy about it, we certainly need a modern Garda station.  Since I first came to the Dáil almost six years ago, I have raised the matter with other colleagues.  I hope we will not see the introduction of too many more Finance Bills before we can say there has been real progress on the issue.  I have much support throughout my community and from my colleagues in the House on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">There has been much talk about green issues and climate change, a matter we should be concerned with.  I come from a generation where there were not many cars on the road and there were still a few horses, but things have changed.  I live in a place that is a city in all but name and the challenges presented by climate change and energy concerns come across very strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Tallaght got some unfair publicity lately when it was named as one of the country's litter blackspots.  That upset all of us.  I did not take the approach of putting my head in the sand and saying there was no problem.  The morning after the Irish Business Against Litter survey was published I walked around Tallaght and had a look for myself.  I was disappointed, although the community does not want us to be negative.  I would certainly never be negative about Tallaght.  If problems have been identified we should be brave enough to deal with them.  In the context of that problem, there is a need for all interests in my town to note the issue, as in other towns.  Other places have faced difficulties in that regard and dealt with them properly.  People in those places can now argue they no longer have a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">There is work to be done, particularly with young people.  I started school across from Leinster House on Clarendon Street, then went to Synge Street and Drimnagh Castle.  In those days we did not speak about climate change or all that much about the environment, as far as I remember.  I remember my school days as good times.  Now I listen to my granddaughter, who is only six, as these issues are discussed in her school.  That is fair enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Any of us can walk a line from a local school to a local shop and see litter in any of our communities.  This disappoints people.  The matter is about waste management and saving our climate.  Although I will not try to steal the clothes of the Green Party, all of us have a role to play in this concern.  We should all try to do our best in our own environs.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I am as bad as anybody in using paper in my office but I try to make a little effort.  Although it is not always possible, I try to leave my car behind when possible and use the Luas instead to go to town and on to Leinster House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_773">I wish to share time with Deputies Durkan and Deenihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I had the pleasure of watching the Budget Statement on television because I was not in the House that day.  It was a non-event; there was very little of significance in it.  The same criticism applies to the Finance Bill which enacts the budget and puts it on a statutory basis.  With two exceptions, the measures on VRT and stamp duty, it is of interest only to tax lawyers and accountants.  There is little to it as an instrument of economic management.  On the day of the budget the Minister spoke about the difficulty of using a budget as an instrument of economic management when the way ahead is so uncertain, especially when the Exchequer returns are in decline and he could not foresee the preceding run of taxation continuing into 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">After contemplating this for a long time, he decided to do nothing and fill the void by borrowing.  This was quite dramatic in terms of the deterioration in the public finances.  He turned a surplus of €2.3 billion into a deficit of €4.9 billion.  Between the end of 2007 and the start of fiscal year 2008, the public finances have deteriorated by a record €7.2 billion.  Since 1922 there was never such a deterioration in public finances over a fiscal year in absolute or percentage terms.  That assumes that the Minister's figures will come in as expected but I do not think they will.  They are based on 60,000 new houses being completed in 2008.  Every 10,000 houses yields €1 billion in taxation to the Exchequer.  The expectation in the building industry is 40,000 houses, a figure calculated by a former colleague of the Minister's, Mr. Parlon.  That represents a deterioration of €2 billion in the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">There is not much in the budget for pay, although new pay negotiations are looming.  On the normal rule of thumb, if one adds the Minister's consumer price index prediction of 3.5% and his growth rate prediction of 3%, the opening position for the pay round will be 6.5%, just to stand still.  That is a significant sum of money on a payroll and the budget does not provide for such serious expenditure on pay.  Although there will not be a full year effect, it will begin to come in this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The budget is based on fairly sandy foundations.  There is a serious deterioration in the public finances and the Government is engaging in a significant borrowing requirement.  The country can afford it for one year because the previous years have been so strong but by the Minister's rolling budget there will be even more serious borrowing in 2009 and 2010.  The Minister's illustrious predecessors, Messrs Lynch, Colley, O'Donoghue, Haughey and O'Malley started out with good intentions in 1977, fulfilling many budget promises, but they trebled the national debt between then and 1981.  This was done in yearly increments and everybody had the best of intentions.  That is what can happen when one goes down this road.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I can see why the Minister decided not to depress demand by taking stringent measures to restore fiscal balance but he did not take the supply side initiatives that would help the economy.  He has made no effort to reform the public service, to eliminate the massive waste in public capital programmes, to fulfil our mantra of being a knowledge economy when we rank 26th out of 32 OECD countries for broadband service, or to restore our competitiveness which has declined on every front over the past five years.  Normally if one cannot risk demand management — I can see why he did not do this — and one borrows, a Minister for Finance managing an economy should have a series of supply side interventions which would make it more efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I agree with the VRT provisions in the Bill.  It was far-sighted of the Green Party Ministers, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to base VRT on engine emissions rather than engine capacity.  The five categories suit all sorts of vehicles.  There is, however, a downside.  I have been driving an environmentally friendly car, a 320 diesel BMW, for several years.  According to a schedule published in <i>The Irish Times</i> the VRT on it before the budgetary changes was €12,900, but after the changes it is €6,800.  A reduction of €6,100 in VRT seems like good news but its effect on me is to reduce the value of my car by €6,000.  For those of us who were conscious of the environmental effect of driving, the first result of this change is to reduce the trade-in value of our cars.  It is worth considering that the first to be penalised are not those who drive gas guzzlers but those who drive low emission cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The cost of motoring is high.  Petrol and diesel have become very expensive, particularly in the past 12 months.  I hope that using VRT as an instrument of environmental protection does not bed in VRT at the current rates because there is a strong case for progressively reducing the burden of VRT.  It was first introduced to protect the car assembly industry in Ireland but where is that industry now?  We and the Danes received permission to introduce VRT for similar reasons.  Now, however, it exists purely to collect taxes.  I hope the Government, particularly the Green Party, will not see this as a way of collecting taxes in the future and using it as an instrument to protect the environment by varying the rates for cars with different emission levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Tolling also makes driving expensive.  The way in which tolling operates at present means the more economically disadvantaged areas will have a higher incidence of tolls than the greater Dublin area.  The reason is that projects in the capital programme that were lower down the priority list were funded by public private partnerships.  In Limerick, one will pay a toll on the Limerick tunnel next year after its completion.  Thereafter, one will pay tolls on the road from Limerick to Nenagh and following the extension of that road to join the motorway at Portlaoise, one will pay a toll along the entire route.  Apart from the expense of driving, the Government should take into consideration that the incidence is heavier on the less competitive regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">While I do not wish to return to the issue of Shannon Airport, I have encountered something that the Minister of State should bring to the attention of his colleagues.  I refer to Aer Lingus's constant policy of trying to close down its routes out of Shannon.  I checked recently on someone's behalf the return cost of flying from Dublin to Los Angeles and from Shannon to Los Angeles.  It cost 50% more to get on the aeroplane in Shannon, fly to Dublin and take the flight to Los Angeles than to fly from Dublin.  At present, the return cost from Dublin to Los Angeles is somewhat more than €400.  However, the difference in cost for taking the flight from Shannon is €230.  This constitutes blatant discrimination on the part of Aer Lingus to give itself justification for closing down the routes from Shannon on the basis that people are not using them and is as good an example as one will find.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I agree in principle with the Minister's actions on stamp duty.  He has adopted the correct approach by acting on a once-off basis rather than incrementally.  However, it is a pity that he did not carry this out last year because it is not now having the effect of putting a safety net under the building industry.  It is too late for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">I will take up my colleague's points on tolling and VRT about which a dangerous trend has become established for many years.  One should not forget that, at present, motorists contribute approximately €5 billion annually to the Exchequer.  In exchange, they are clamped if they park anywhere and must pay a toll to drive from one county or town to another.  Moreover, as my colleague also pointed out, those who drive eco-friendly cars have been penalised for so doing.  Strange things have happened over the years and while the current Minister was not specifically responsible, they form part of the trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I wish to refer briefly to a subject with which the Minister is fully familiar.  In common with many others, I am worried about the economy's competitiveness at present.  This issue has not arisen in the past six months but has been present for more than five years.  I understand the Government's relative contentment with inflation, particularly house price inflation, because it receives more money in VAT, stamp duty and every which way.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Although it has been suggested that 100% lending was the cause of the problem, lending at 150% and, in some cases, 200% was the cause.  In some developments, house prices were inflated by up to €80,000 per unit in the space of a weekend.  This constitutes serious inflation and no action was taken to deal with it.  Consequently, many people have been obliged to pay mortgages well in excess of what they could command.  This is not a new development and has happened before.  It has happened in the United Kingdom and in the United States and there is no point in blaming either for our problems.  We contributed to our own problems in a serious manner.  Why were rules not introduced in respect of credit control?  This would have been a simple matter, particularly at a time when interests rates were low.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">My colleague across the floor is making signals.  I am unsure whether he wants to know the time or is anxious to get home.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_789">Members should be clear that this should not have happened.  It has been brought to my attention by investors in my constituency and gives me no pleasure to state that unless we check, challenge and address the issue of competitiveness in the economy, both manufacturing and service industries will suffer.  As the Minister is aware, such enterprises are relocating on a regular basis to more competitive economies and state openly that this is what is happening.  It is now imperative that the lending institutions, the financial services sector, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank come together to find out how best to address the issues that now are cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">While the Minister may state it is easy to make this point in hindsight, some Members have been making this point for the past five or six years.  Whenever one mentioned such issues, one was regarded as being unpatriotic for suggesting the taking of steps that might have improved the position.  The country is going through a test at present.  This is a test for the Minister, who is capable of facing any test.  The question of how to deal with the unfolding economic situation also constitutes a test for the Government and the people.  While it can be surmounted, doing so will take a great deal of determination and guidance from those whose responsibility it is to give such guidance.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_791">The spin by many Government speakers in recent days has been to blame Opposition Members for talking down the economy.  However, I intend to cite some figures produced by the Department of Finance that demonstrate that the points made by the Opposition are completely accurate and were not exaggerated.  In 2007, tax revenue was €47,249 million, which was €1,826 million below target.  An Exchequer deficit of €1,619 million was recorded in 2007, compared to a surplus of €2,265 million for 2006 and a budgeted Exchequer deficit of €546 million.  The budget 2008 forecast for the Exchequer deficit is €4,866 million.  If this does not constitute a problem when analysing the economy, what does?</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Another statistic I examined concerned the most recent balance of payments data, which relate to the third quarter of 2007.  The data show a current account deficit of €1,768 million in the third quarter.  In addition, the deficit for 2006 was the largest current account deficit ever recorded.  Undoubtedly, other speakers will confirm that the economy is not perfect and that a major problem exists.  According to the latest set of forecasts published by the Central Bank, economic growth will halve this year.  The volume of goods and services produced by the economy, or gross national product, GNP, is expected to increase by 2.6% this year compared to an estimated real GNP growth of 5.1% in 2007.  In addition, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose in January at the fastest pace since 1980.  That statistic speaks volumes about achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">In addition, business conditions have deteriorated markedly in the Republic.  More than four years of growth in manufacturing came to an abrupt end in January.  Furthermore, a recent analysis appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on individual debt in Ireland.  In the past 20 years, the economy has been fuelled by American investment, especially from the information technology and pharmaceutical industries, by European investment, including Structural Funds, and, to an even greater degree, by domestic borrowing.  The local economy has been fuelled by local individual borrowing and, as Deputy Noonan has noted, every house completion is worth the equivalent of approximately €100,000 in taxation.  However, that trend has now stopped.  The money borrowed from banks and elsewhere — it was once the State that borrowed and now it is the individual — was spent directly on fuelling the economy, providing services, etc.  It was not really a sound economic philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">A recent statistic suggests the value of our exports is increasing but apparently it is decreasing.   Foreign-owned firms are responsible for 90% of our exports.  There seems to be a wobble in the US economy and a 1% drop in US growth translates into a 1.75% decrease in Irish growth.  Since our export trade is so dependent on foreign-owned international companies, the wobble will therefore have major repercussions for the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I welcome the initiatives on vehicle registration tax.  Ten years ago, when Deputy Noonan and I were official spokespersons on finance, I called for such a measure.  Traditionally, we dealt with emissions by trading and capping but the way to proceed is to focus on new appliances, be they cars or other items.  We must deal with them and I agree with the proposed policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">If the Minister, Deputy Cowen, takes nothing else from tonight's discussion, he can take the point that any admission by an Opposition that a budget is a non-event is a real goal for a Minister for Finance.  Despite the recent downturn in the global economy, particularly the US economy, Ireland has been and will remain largely unscathed.  This is due to the experience and forward planning of the Government.  It is capable of taking practical steps when required.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I am thankful that the Minister is not one for knee-jerk reactions and I am confident he will see this country through the global economic difficulties.  This Bill does not consist of measures to deal with an economy on the brink of economic downturn but of measures created by a forward-thinking and solid Government capable of upholding and advancing an already buoyant economy.  I had prepared a ten-minute speech but due to the time restriction, I will hand over to my colleague.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterPowerFF" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Deputy Peter Power</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I thank Deputy Blaney for sharing the very limited time that is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">It is regrettable that there has been so much negative comment on the economy by the Opposition and the media in the debate over the past two days.  It is clear that there is confusion between instability in the financial markets and national economic instability.  Those who are confusing the concepts would have done well to have attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week, chaired by Deputy Michael Finneran, at which the Governor of the Central Bank made it perfectly clear that the fundamentals of the economy are absolutely strong.  While share prices go up and down and financial market stability increases and decreases, the underlying, real economy remains the same, strong and robust.  Most people would accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I always respect the comments of my constituency colleague, Deputy Noonan, but on this occasion he is very much mistaken.  His central thesis this evening was based on the premise that the budget did nothing.  The reality is quite different.  Although a number of countries, particularly the United States, are introducing quite radical and, some would say, untimely financial packages and interest rates, the Minister for Finance in Ireland introduced his fiscal package long before the financial instability.  It was called the budget and it involved a measured, prudent, proportionate injection of liquidity that did not in any way jeopardise our financial market.  Deputy Noonan dressed this up as reckless borrowing.  We will take no lectures in this quarter from a Government that lost power in 1987 when the banks were knocking on the door due to Fine Gael's borrowing.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_809">I thank Deputies for the many interesting contributions to the debate on the Finance Bill 2008 and look forward to a constructive and informed discussion on Committee Stage, during which I hope Deputies will have a fuller opportunity to discuss some of the issues of interest to them.  In my reply I will respond, in so far as possible, to the points made by the Deputies on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">In my introductory remarks, I pointed to the hallmarks of an equitable tax system and to what had been achieved in recent years for those on low and average incomes and for the more vulnerable groups in society.  On the question of tax incentives, successive Governments, of all hues, have used such reliefs for the purpose of furthering certain socioeconomic objectives.  Once again, Deputy Burton has failed to acknowledge any of the measures taken by me or my predecessor to abolish reliefs that had achieved their purpose and whose continuation was no longer appropriate, or to counter tax avoidance, or on base broadening, with a view to achieving greater equity in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I point in particular to the measure I introduced in the Finance Act 2006, which came into effect from 1 January 2007.  The measure restricts the use of tax incentive reliefs and will ensure that those who have high incomes and who use tax incentive reliefs will have an effective rate of income tax of about 20% at least.  Data from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on those with the highest incomes in the country consistently show that the majority of them pay tax at or close to the top rate.  It is estimated for 2008 that the top 1%, approximately, of income earners, representing those earning in excess of €200,000 per annum, will contribute about 25% of the expected yield compared to less than 15% of the income tax take in 1997.  These are the indisputable facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Deputy Bruton alleged that the Government was introducing new tax incentive schemes without any appropriate cost-benefit analysis but this is not the case.  In budget 2006, I made it clear that any proposals for the introduction of new special incentive reliefs should, as far as appropriate, be time limited and subject to an assessment of costs and benefits prior to their introduction.  Since then, the mid-Shannon scheme was subject to an independent cost-benefit analysis before it was introduced and the film relief scheme was subject to one before it was extended.  Therefore, the Deputy's assertion that no cost-benefit analyses are being conducted on proposed new tax incentive schemes is clearly wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Deputy Bruton's concerns regarding the termination of the schemes in July 2008 rather than at an earlier date fly in the face of the recommendations of the consultants who carried out the reviews, who saw no merit in an early termination of the property-based schemes in 2006.  Rather, both external consultants' reports recommended that the schemes be retained for existing projects over a transitional period in order to allow for an orderly winding down of the schemes and to prevent overheating of the wider construction sector in the rush to meet the 2006 deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I remind the Deputy that the main property schemes have been closed off to new projects since early 2003 in the case of the urban renewal scheme and since December 2004 in the case of the reliefs for student accommodation, hotels, holiday cottages, town renewal, rural renewal and the living over the shop scheme.  While the Deputy is correct in stating the schemes are due to terminate in 2008, he fails to acknowledge that the time extension applied to pipeline projects only and also that, during the extended period, the levels of reliefs provided were reduced progressively to 75% and 50% of the levels that applied previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">My decision to provide for a orderly winding down of these schemes between 2006 and 2008 reflected a pragmatic and balanced approach which took into account the significant role of the construction sector in the economy as a generator of economic growth and employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Deputy Burton expressed concern about a potential rise in home repossessions and about families meeting their mortgage commitments.  As I noted in my reply to her in the House last week, possession orders applied for are not always granted or implemented and they are not always issued against residential properties.  I am sure the Deputy would also acknowledge that higher levels of court proceedings for property repossessions need to be interpreted with caution given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the fact that not all of the proceedings relate to residential property.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Even where orders are secured, some are not enforced.  The number of orders granted by the High Court in 2006 represented a tiny proportion of all home mortgages, in the order of 0.05%, and the Irish experience is of low levels of non-performance on mortgage loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">In this context, the Financial Stability Report 2007, published last November by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, points out that there are no firm indications of a significantly higher level of mortgage arrears in the banking system.  In overall terms, housing affordability is supported by relatively low loan-to-value ratios, income growth, interest rates that are relatively low in historic terms and, in particular, increases in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">In regard to mortgage repayments, the Government has provided substantial assistance in budgets 2007 and 2008 in the form of increased mortgage interest relief to those most in need of support in this area, that is, first-time buyers within the first seven years of taking out their mortgage.  This has substantially cushioned the impact of increases in interest rates.  Cumulatively, as a result of the last two budgets, first-time buyers have obtained additional relief of up to €100 per month, if single, or €200 per month, if married or widowed, subject to paying sufficient mortgage interest to avail of the relief.  These improvements are in addition to the complete reform of stamp duty on residential property which considerably alters the economics of house purchase and repayment, especially for first-time buyers.  The measures taken by the Government in the past two years represent a substantial level of support to mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Deputy Burton also referred to the tax position of a single person on the average industrial wage where bonus payments or overtime payments are received.  With the single standard rate band set at €35,400 for 2008, the average industrial wage for 2008, estimated at some €34,000, is placed well outside liability to the higher rate of tax.  This fulfils the commitment made in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The effective tax rate of a PAYE worker on the average industrial wage of €34,000 is some 9% in 2008.  If such a person earns, for example, an extra €2,000 in bonuses or overtime this year, his or her effective tax rate will be approximately 10%.  The Deputy will agree that such low effective tax rates at such low levels is a substantial signal of the importance the Government has attached to reducing the tax burden for lower and average earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The latest comparative data available from the OECD, relating to 2006, indicate that in international terms, for the single worker on average earnings, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU and can report significant progress on income tax reform as a result.  Deputies are probably tired of hearing me say this because it has been the case for each of the seven years from 2000 to 2006.  For a married one-earner couple with two children on average earnings, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the entire OECD.  In addition, when cash transfers from the State are taken into account, such couples face a negative burden because they receive more in cash transfers than they pay out in tax and social security contributions.  Ireland is the only OECD country where this is the case.  Moreover, the data do not take into account the further improvements made in budgets 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I remind the House of an interesting fact.  After budget 2008, the percentage of the income tax yield coming from those earning at or under the average industrial wage is estimated at 4% of the total tax yield as compared to more than 14% when we came into office in 1997.  Such earners represent approximately 55% of all income earners.  This represents a considerable improvement in terms of tax equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Deputies Bruton, Burton and Shortall referred to the absence of provisions in the Finance Bill dealing with the pensions system.  The Green Paper on pensions was published in the autumn of last year and sets out comprehensively both the challenges facing us and the options for change in the pensions area.  The Green Paper is a discussion document aimed at ensuring that we have an informed public debate before any particular approaches to dealing with the pensions agenda are decided.  In this context, a period of consultation on the contents of the Green Paper is under way.  It would not be appropriate for the Government to undermine this consultation process by adopting particular courses of action at this stage.  We will listen to what the social partners and others have to say on this and the other issues discussed in the Green Paper before progressing proposals in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Deputy Burton raised the issue of the cost of the incentive for energy-efficient equipment, and Deputies O'Donnell and Finneran asked why it is not being extended to individuals.  This incentive involves providing companies with the opportunity to invest in certain specified energy-saving technologies and being able to write off the full cost of that investment against their taxable income in the year of purchase.  In the normal course, companies would only be entitled to write off the cost of this type of expenditure over eight years.  The additional cost to the Exchequer arising from this incentive in terms of tax forgone will depend on the extent to which it encourages more companies to invest in the specified equipment than would do so in the absence of the incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Moreover, it should be recognised that there will be benefits and savings to investing companies, the economy and the environment from the increased use of energy-efficient equipment.  Putting a monetary value on these benefits is not a simple matter, but this incentive should be viewed in the nature of a "pump priming" exercise that will operate for three years.  It is hoped that, over time, companies will see the ongoing value of investing in energy-efficient equipment in terms of the improved economic returns to themselves as well as the environmental benefits to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I note the welcome from Deputy Burton for the measures designed to increase the tax take from higher profits from the exploitation of future oil and gas finds.  The Deputy asks whether these measures cannot be applied retrospectively.  There are limits on the extent to which it is legal or desirable to make taxation retrospective, while there is a compelling case for increasing the tax take in the future from more profitable oil and gas fields.  Internationally, licensing terms are being amended in favour of national governments in light of increasing oil prices and fewer prospect areas available for exploration.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The overall objective of the changes being made in this Bill is to ensure that the State will get a higher return in the case of more profitable oil and gas fields while continuing to encourage the industry to invest in exploration for oil and gas.  We must get the balance right between ensuring, on the one hand, that Ireland gets an appropriate return for the exploitation of its resources while, on the other, giving sufficient encouragement to those who would search out and extract those resources at considerable risk.  The revised arrangements achieve that balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Deputy O'Donnell referred to the changes being introduced to bring the tax treatment of foreign-sourced dividends received by companies in Ireland effectively into line with the tax treatment of the underlying income out of which domestic-sourced dividends are paid.  He has called for the introduction of participation exemption.  There is an argument that entirely exempting foreign-sourced dividends from taxation would help to encourage corporations to locate their headquarters or holding companies in Ireland.  While there may be something in this, there are also some downsides to bear in mind.  We must be careful not to contravene the EU code of conduct on business taxation and not to open the door to Ireland being used as an open channel for the passage of untaxed foreign income to other destinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">While we always look closely at suggestions which could increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for foreign investment, I must find the right balance in this case.  A concession of the type being sought by various commentators could have the negative side effect of attracting operations of little substance whose purpose here would mainly involve tax planning.  We maintain an attractive low rate of corporation tax and will continue to do so.  We maintain a tax system that is efficient and open to business and will continue to do so.  Commentators who take one aspect of our system and compare it to favourable aspects of other systems often miss the key point that our business tax system is very attractive in the round.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">With regard to Deputy Burton's comments on carbon emissions trading, the provisions in this regard are part of a package of measures that should assist with business development within the international financial services industry and are consistent with the Government's commitment in the Building on Success report proactively to "pursue appropriate actions for the further development of the industry".  Trading in carbon credits is an integral part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Carbon credit trading is one element of our approach to meeting our Kyoto targets as set out in the national climate change strategy.  It also forms part of the EU's proposals for the post-Kyoto period to 2020.  It is recognised that it helps reduce emissions globally, encourages technology transfer and helps lesser developed countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Deputy Burton has accused me of undermining the housing market when it came to amending the stamp duty regime.  I have made it clear that it was my intention that changes to the stamp duty regime that would disrupt the market would not be introduced, not that reform of stamp duty could not take place.  The election of itself raised speculation as regards possible changes to the stamp duty regime which was fuelled primarily by the Deputy's proposal to introduce changes over a three-year period.  It was responsible to react to this speculation and bring certainty to the market by setting out future intentions with regard to stamp duty reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">Deputy Mansergh correctly pointed out that it is just not possible to introduce stamp duty reform in an overheated market.  The conditions that now prevail allow for reform of the stamp duty regime without unduly affecting the market conditions.  That is why I have chosen to introduce reform at this time rather than when the market was overheated.  The reform will lead to a direct benefit for purchasers rather than sellers which, to answer Deputy Michael Noonan's question, would have been the position if they were introduced earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Turning finally to the macro-economy, many Deputies spent much of their time speaking on this topic rather than the contents of the Bill, which is fair enough.  More than anything else, it is important that we take a balanced perspective on the economic outlook and on developments in the construction sector.  Developments in the housing market in recent years are a reflection of the success of our economy.  Employment has risen substantially, earnings have increased and taxes have been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">As Deputy Peter Power said, it is clear that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong.  The Irish workforce is dynamic, well educated and responsive to changing circumstances.  We are committed to the consensus approach to wage formulation through the social partnership process which has played its part in delivering key benefits to our economy in the past and by ensuring that all stakeholders in our economy have a shared sense of the emerging issues.  Social partnership will form a key part of our response to any difficulties that may emerge.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_973">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening.  It is an incredible indictment of the Government, of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE that it is left to the courage of a young patient to get a promise of some action regarding the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a condition that claimed 30 young lives in 2007.  It is not as though the HSE is not aware of the problem.  Management boards of hospitals, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE are all in key positions to make changes, so why has there been stalemate for so many years?</p>
          <p eId="para_974">This evening, I simply want answers to the following questions arising mainly from the reply given by the Minister of State last night.  According to the Minister of State, 44 additional staff to deal with cystic fibrosis, CF, patients have been appointed throughout the country.  Where exactly are they located?  What positions do they hold?  What are the terms of their appointments?  Have the posts for the 37 promised staff actually been advertised?  What exactly are the posts and where will they be located?  I want no more fudge, but some simple facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I wish to comment on the provision of facilities in St. Vincent's Hospital.  I want to declare a personal interest in this saga and I can vouch for the appalling conditions to which vulnerable young adults were and are exposed in wards where CF patients are treated.  I can also vouch for the dedication and professionalism of the staff there.  Any progress in the provision of additional isolation units in St. Vincent's Hospital is welcome, but I remind the Minister of State that there are between 18 and 25 CF patients at any one time at this of year in the hospital.  Approximately another ten are awaiting beds there.  Can the Government at least plan for the seasonal needs of CF patients?  Otherwise, we will all be back again this time next year with Joe Duffy leading the attack again.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Can the Minister of State confirm that the promised units in St. Vincent's Hospital will be ring-fenced for CF patients?  Why is not possible to provide further prefab space for additional units?  I understand that this can be done if the will is there to do it.  Will the units proposed for St. Mark's ward and St. Camillus's ward in the hospital be en suite?  This is not clear from any press statements I have seen.  When can we expect that CF patients will be admitted directly to wards without the trauma of lying on a trolley or sitting on a chair in the accident and emergency ward, often for days, surrounded by other unfortunate patients with a variety of infections?  What plans are proposed for other centres around the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_977">When will newborn babies be routinely screened for CF as occurs for other conditions and in other countries?  Why is it that only one CF lung transplant has been carried out in the Mater Hospital to date?  What exactly is the arrangement between the Mater Hospital and Freeman Hospital in Newcastle regarding lung transplants?  How many transplants were carried out in 2006 and 2007 in Newcastle on Irish patients?  What is the commitment from the hospital in Newcastle to the Government on behalf of CF patients in Ireland?  What is the financial arrangement between the Department of Health and Children here and Freeman Hospital regarding transplants for CF patients?</p>
          <p eId="para_978">I want to highlight the need for a co-ordinated and unified approach to the management of CF patients post-transplant.  A single centre of excellence is needed where all aspects before and after transplants can be carried out.  Cystic fibrosis does not go away just because one is lucky enough to get a transplant.  Very specific challenges have to be addressed for post-transplant cystic fibrosis patients.  That facility is not available in this country at the moment.  It is split between the Mater and a centre of excellence at St. Vincent's, each with a specific speciality than can be delivered effectively.  However, the two have to be combined for the sake of cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Where is the national reference microbiology laboratory that was recommended by Pollock?  This is absolutely crucial, given the changing and rapid environment in which micro-organisms are affecting cystic fibrosis patients, literally almost on a weekly basis.  The most up-to-date facilities and services are needed to ensure the best treatment for those bacteria.  What about the national register and the need for committed funding?  This happens on a year to year basis and it is no way to provide a reliable and ongoing service.  There must be a long-term commitment, providing money to ensure the register can be updated.  We are very much dependent on ensuring we have the correct number of patients on that register.  To do that the money must be made available to allow people to get on with that job.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Paediatric services are just as much in need of quality facilities as the adult units.  What provisions are being made to upgrade these facilities in Crumlin, for example?  When will the HSE provide replies to parliamentary questions that contain some real information.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">Either a senior counsel is needed to interpret what they contain or there is absolutely nothing in them.  It is time we got real factual information.  That is why this evening I am posing those very specific questions.  I want facts, not fudge, because we have had a great deal of the latter but no substance and no content.  That is my basic reason for asking the questions in the manner I have, so that I may at least have some facts to relate back to the many people with a very important interest in this life-threatening disease, in the country that has the highest incidence of this disease in the world.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_985">I thank my colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Like Deputy Upton I do not believe five minutes is enough on the issue of health.  I will speak tonight on the whole area of hospital acquired infections.  I would like to speak, as well, on childhood diabetes, which I have raised numerous times in this House, and the lack of treatment facilities and care in Cork despite all the rhetoric from the Government.  The parents of children as young as 18 months are handed an orange and a syringe and told to practise with them and they will be fine.  Then there are the consequences into adulthood for the children concerned and the poor health they will finally end up with as a result of the neglect of Government in a time of boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I listened today to the debate on the economy and every Government speaker told the House we were the envy of the world.  I accept we are when it comes to the economy, but people who admire us for this are appalled at what we have done with that boom in terms of services.  The health service is just one of those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">I want to talk about hospital acquired infections.  Most people are aware of MRSA, but there are several others.  I will talk of my experience in this regard, as no stranger to hospitals.  During my lifetime I have been in hospital every second year, on average.  I attended a meeting recently of people who had lost loved ones through MRSA.  It should never happen, but when it does it is as if it has not occurred at all.  There is no admission of guilt and no traceability.  We have traceability in the food industry, but none when it comes to our loved ones who die from hospital acquired infections.  I keep hearing about the Department's plans.  Several reports have been published about cleaning hospitals, and doctors and nurses cleaning their hands, but what is really needed is a campaign to allow patients to be comfortable while challenging people to wash their hands, without them feeling threatened as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">In the main, medical staff are good people whose entire focus in life is on treating patients and ensuring they get better.  When will we install in hospitals clean rooms where the staff change into uniforms from their day clothes and go to work and, when finished, change back into their street clothes and leave?  On any day of the week in Cork hospitals one may see medical staff leave at 1 o'clock to do their shopping and come back without changing their clothes.  I have witnessed this in hospitals.  When are we going to get real about infection control?  I have seen filthy toilets being cleaned extensively and the same cleaning utensils being used on wards.  When will we accept that infection is carried, not just by patients, but by people treating them and those who are in and out of hospitals?  When will something be done about it?</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The Minister for Health and Children abolished health boards and employed more staff.  In effect, the only thing she did was to remove the people's voice from those boards because the elected representatives knew the everyday concerns of the population.  She produced an executive that was at arm's length, she said, because of excessive interference.  Arm's length usually means out of one's grasp and out of control.  When are we going to return to the health boards?  When will we allow the people to have true control over their health service?</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_991">I want to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Finian McGrath and Michael Lowry.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I am glad this motion has been brought before the House because it gives us the opportunity to take stock of the measures that have been taken in the provision of health services.  The motion refers to a number of issues, including cystic fibrosis and mental health.  This public debate must seem like a double-edged sword for those suffering from cystic fibrosis and indeed mental illness, and their families who carry much of the accompanying difficulties and hardship.  On the one hand, this debate gives voice to those who are suffering and ensures the issue stays top of the agenda.  On the other, it must be very difficult for those families and individuals listening to various experiences of hardship.  It is therefore a double-edged sword, but on balance it is a good way to raise these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">I heard Deputy Upton refer to Joe Duffy leading the charge.  My impression, as a new Deputy, was that the Opposition was supposed to set the agenda.  I did not realise that the media were setting the agenda——</p>

Therefore, we are well aware of the difficulties.  There is no magic wand.  There is a long way to go.  The built infrastructure has serious deficits which are being addressed.  We have come a long way in terms of the multidisciplinary teams that are required and we will continue to prioritise not only cystic fibrosis but also mental health.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1001">I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important and urgent debate on our health service and particularly cystic fibrosis patients.  I commend the cystic fibrosis patients and their families on their courage and dignity.  I thank people such as Dara Crowley, Orla Tinsley, Paul Dempsey, Philip Ahern, Charlie Gallagher, head of the cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Gerry McElvaney at Beaumont Hospital, Dr. Murphy at Tallaght Hospital, Godfrey Fletcher and all the families in the cystic fibrosis association for their hard work and efforts in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I have met cystic fibrosis patients and have visited them in hospital.  I know the issues and I understand the hurt and pain.  Yes, they are being treated badly but this is changing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">During the election campaign I read and was strongly influenced by Sam Smyth's great article on cystic fibrosis.  When elected I included cystic fibrosis services in my agreement with the Taoiseach.  It is in section 5 of my agreement and is something on which I am determined to deliver.  We need a dedicated unit at St. Vincent's Hospital and we need it as soon as possible.  I agree that cystic fibrosis patients have waited too long.  However, we also need an interim solution which I have been pushing behind the scenes.  I thank all the cystic fibrosis families who telephoned my office with constructive ideas and plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">I welcome the temporary solution to fast-track six beds for St. Mark's ward at St. Vincent's Hospital within weeks and an extra eight single rooms which will create a total of 14 single rooms available for cystic fibrosis patients.  In my constituency I warmly welcome the extra €2.5 million for Beaumont Hospital which operates as a regional centre in providing services to people with cystic fibrosis.  Gerry McElvaney and his team are doing an excellent job and I know the northside parents welcome this extra cash investment.  This is leading to improved isolation and infection control facilities together with enhanced outpatient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients attending the hospitals.  I am also meeting the chief executive of Beaumont Hospital on this and many other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The battle has begun for these services.  We will know in two years if we have won the war for these patients.  I do not make any false promises but I give a commitment to try to deliver first class services to our patients.  I will not take any lectures or old guff from editorials in <i>The Irish Times</i> accusing me of backstairs political deals on the cystic fibrosis issue.  I gave a promise to help cystic fibrosis patients and I put it in the deal.  All I want is that the deal be implemented as soon as possible.  Politics is about delivering and if I can deliver to people I will be satisfied with my efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">On the broader issue of health, the hidden story in this year's budget was that despite budgetary constraints €16.2 billion is being spent in 2008, an increase of €1.1 billion on last year's provision, an extra €50 million of this is going to the disability sector and €35 million extra to cancer services.  I urge all Deputies to support the cystic fibrosis patients.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry</from>
          <p eId="para_1007">Last Sunday night I met with the Tipperary cystic fibrosis organisation and heard heart-breaking stories of neglect and the failure of our health system to respond to genuine needs, problems with accommodation and facilities and problems with staffing levels.  In the mid-west region the following concerns need to be addressed in the short term.  The first is the provision of necessary, fully equipped ensuite bedrooms for cystic fibrosis sufferers in key adult and paediatric units in Limerick, Waterford, Cork and in the central unit in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.  This would prevent the risk of cross-infection that is of such danger and critically affects the survival rate of people with cystic fibrosis.  Extra specialised training staff in cystic fibrosis care are badly needed, including an urgent need for the posting of a second cystic fibrosis nurse in Waterford Regional Hospital.  In the home domiciliary care area we need a dedicated cystic fibrosis home nurse and a dedicated cystic fibrosis physiotherapist to cater for the mid-west area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Cystic fibrosis patients should be automatically entitled to a medical card and their families should be entitled to a carer's allowance that is non-means tested.  It is a disgrace in 2008, having all the information we have on the condition, that this policy has still not been initiated.  Cystic fibrosis sufferers should not have to report to accident and emergency departments on the occasions when they need hospital care as they should not be subjected and exposed to the infections and viruses in those departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">A national screening programme at neo-natal level should be initiated for the detection of cystic fibrosis.  An early diagnosis and the correct treatment from birth would mean much better living prospects for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">I call on the Minister to initiate a national debate on the issue of presumed organ donation along the lines of the proposed UK model as outlined by Gordon Brown and the highly successful Spanish model that is currently in practice.  While I acknowledge that many issues in this area need to be teased out and that the subject should be handled with extreme sensitivity, all parties can see the benefit of such a move to sufferers of many diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">In general terms the health service has been burdened and stymied by vested interests within the system.  The time is long overdue for a Minister for Health and Children to establish as a first principle that patient need is paramount and that the welfare of patients is a first priority.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Harney, has the courage, conviction and determination to tackle the vested interests within the health service and I will support her in her efforts to force and implement change.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I wish to point out some stark facts and offer a basis on how to move forward to improve our health service and especially to tackle the unacceptable threatened diminution in services.  Spending on health has increased by 370% during the last decade, seven times the rate of inflation, yet the HSE in the north east is running at €26 million over budget and the Cavan-Monaghan group has a deficit of €9 million.  How is this happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The Department's allocation is based on an approved service plan.  Heath spending increased by 7% this year.  Why is the HSE not running a service in the north east that provides high quality patient care within its budget?  The memo leaked last week indicates that discussions to stem this deficit are taking place and the axe will wield on frontline services.  There is no mention of cuts at administrative or managerial level.  Nationally, there are 2.5 administrative staff for every doctor in the health service.  The number of grade eight workers, such as managers, accountants and IT personnel, between late 2005 and 2007 increased from 521 to 713.  I realise there is a need for support staff.  However, evidence presented to me suggests that many of these are surplus to requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The fundamental issue here is accountability of the Health Service Executive.  We must hold this body to account.  The crucial point that must be kept in mind at all times is that the HSE is seemingly wasting or misspending or misapportioning public money.  One euro out of every €4 of tax for every man and woman is spent on health.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to claim back accountability for this expenditure.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1016">As TDs we must be able to see, query and demand to know where and how our constituents' and taxpayers' money is spent and why frontline services appear to be regressing rather than progressing.  I have been assured and have been telling my constituents that a new regional hospital will be built and that no services will be removed from Monaghan hospital until a safer, better and more appropriate alternative is in place.  I accept the Government amendment as a pledge in this regard and I will play my part in ensuring this happens.  If we lift the flawed logic that the HSE is employing for the proposed reductions in services we see carts before horses everywhere.  Money has been spent on a high quality treatment room and it threatened the service.  Our coronary care unit which has a higher record of safety and better outcomes than most other facilities throughout the country was also threatened.  We lost two casualty consultants and there has been a definite change for the worse in the level of service provided, and certainly no replacement with a safe or superior alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The leaked document stated that the changes are dependent on many factors, including improved home care packages.  I ask where the HSE proposes to get the €9 million it would require to put these packages in place.  If Monaghan hospital is taken off call, the risks greatly increase as people have further to travel to access medical care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">It seems the HSE is making it up as it goes along and it is constantly changing the goalposts.  In November I attended the official opening of a newly refurbished ward costing €5 million.  I said then that the facilities were as good as could be found anywhere in Ireland and Britain.  How, therefore, can the HSE justify a reduction in frontline services to the people of my constituency after opening a totally refurbished ward?  I ask the HSE one simple question, what are the people of Monaghan to do when they fall ill?  The HSE is now a professional master at changing the goalposts on many issues.  There is never a plan B or an alternative.  There seems to be a lack of logic and joined-up thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I call for a wholesale audit of the HSE from the top to the bottom of the organisation at financial, managerial and human resource level.  We must identify the black holes that swallow up millions of euro which should be prioritised for frontline services.  We must have an independent audit of the management of taxpayers' money.  We must streamline management and administrative processes.  I suggest as a starting point that we need to undertake an audit to ascertain the current position and how many support staff we really need.  It seems bizarre that we amalgamated so many organisations when the HSE was created and did not restructure the support staff at the same time.  This is where the savings must be made, not on frontline services.  There must not be any diminution of services until this audit takes place.  We must call a halt to the current crazy situation where the bloated HSE is allowed to expand and become even more unwieldy.  I call for a halt to that.</p>

          <from>Deputy M. J. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_1021">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  We all recognise there are difficulties and shortcomings.  Indeed, the Minister acknowledged the shortcomings in the area of the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.  Having spoken to them, I know there is no Member of the Oireachtas who has not been lobbied in recent weeks, particularly since this debate took place on radio.  There is an urgent need for single rooms in our hospitals for cystic fibrosis patients.  I am glad the Minister has given a commitment that urgent short-term measures are being put in place in St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin.  The HSE, for all its faults, has given a commitment that it is fast-tracking the development of a ward adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's, which I welcome.  However, it will take time.  Why is it only now that the HSE has become alarmed at the shortcomings in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients?</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">International comparisons show that Irish cystic fibrosis patients are at a greater disadvantage than their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK.  It is important that this debate has become public because something is being done, albeit belatedly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">This debate also concerns the health service in general.  It would be wrong only to be critical.  While there are areas of serious deficiency, we have made much progress over the years.  Reference was made in this debate to the fourfold increase in funding in the budgets between 1997 and 2007 and the capital programme has increased by three and a half times in that period, from €167 million to over €580 million.  Our spending is almost 9% of GNP, which compares favourably with other countries in the OECD area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The health services are making progress and people are living longer.  As a result, there will be greater demands on the health service, and the HSE and the Department of Health and Children will have to come to terms with that positive development.  Life expectancy for women is now 80 years and for men it is 75 years, an increase of five years for both men and women since the 1980s.  The rise has been very rapid since 1999 in particular and life expectancy in Ireland now exceeds the European average, which is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Our lifestyles have changed.  Various factors are involved and Ministers are to be commended for this, particularly the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, whose ban on smoking in the workplace was unique in that he found it very difficult to get that legislation through the Houses, in particular past some of his parliamentary colleagues.  We now have an excellent infant care service and infant mortality decreased by 35% between 1999 and 2005.  The rate of heart disease as a cause of death has decreased by 42%, which is also a result of improved lifestyles.  I welcome the initiatives in various Departments to improve this further.  Cancer survival is improving.  Five-year survival rates for breast cancer are rising at one of the highest rates in Europe, which is positive.  Some 40,000 cancer patients were discharged from public hospitals in ten years, an increase of 70%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The situation is not all bad.  The HSE has a job to do and I encourage the Minister in this regard.  The small-minded swipe by the Opposition at the Minister, Deputy Harney, with regard to her trip to the US was unbecoming of the members of the Opposition.  It distracted from what is a serious debate.  I wish the Minister well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1027">I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  It is important we should have as much debate as possible on the provision of health services, particularly given the large budget administered by the HSE.  I agree with the previous speakers with regard to their comments on cystic fibrosis and mental health sufferers.  However, I will confine my comments to dealing with some of the positive aspects of the health service.  Debates sometimes become clouded by focusing on shortcomings and misgivings, but it is not all doom and gloom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harney, and her team of Ministers of State for their commitment to their job.  It is not an easy area and issues often arise which are not of their making or that of their predecessors but which go back many years.  We must place the health service in the context of developments since the foundation of the State and through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when investment was not made because the country was not in a position to invest in capital and current health service budgets.  Given this history, the health service is coming from a deficit position or a standing start.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">Debates on the provision of health services often go back to the old health board versus HSE argument and focus on whether the situation was better when there were eight health boards and health board meetings were held once a month.  We debate whether we should reverse engines or whether the situation was better then than now — I do not believe it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">My constituency is served by a number of hospitals in Limerick city.  Eight consultants were recently appointed to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, officially opened the Children's Ark, which is a full-time teaching facility.  A number of public representatives were involved with a deputation from the maternity hospital and plans are afoot to provide a new maternity hospital on the grounds of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, which is welcome and positive for the area.  The Mid-Western Regional Hospital does not have the physical capacity to cope with the throughput with which it must deal.  Both medical and non-medical professional staff within that area work under extremely pressurised conditions.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are examining the situation with a view to relocating to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital campus.  They have outlined a construction timetable for that and are working through a planning phase of the programme.  I urge everybody involved in the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to keep the process on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Previous speakers referred to the HSE's annual budget, which is €16.2 billion.  I wish to outline some of the areas which I find to be quite positive, particularly concerning services for the elderly.  We are awaiting legislation in this regard but €110 million is being provided to cover extra costs that will arise this year under the new long-term residential care scheme which was announced by the Minister last year.  The purpose of the new scheme is to equalise the level of State support provided to individuals in public and private nursing homes.  It also aims to make private long-term residential care affordable and anxiety-free thus obviating the necessity for people to sell or mortgage their homes in order to pay for nursing home care.  No one currently in long-term care will be financially disadvantaged by the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">An extra €25 million is being allocated to increase community services provided to older people.  It will also allow for increases in a number of home care supports, home help hours and day respite places.  These services, which have seen a major investment in recent years, are designated to help older people to live in their own homes.  The policy is to build up sufficient home and community-based care so that less than one in 20 people over 65 will be in residential care.</p>

Comments were made about the administration side of the health service and while that may be true, it should be remembered that successive national wage agreements have had an effect.  There is an industrial relations bargaining process and practices have built up which are not easy to root out.  We have recently seen the conclusion of talks with the consultants' body and I congratulate the Minister for sticking with that difficult process which has now come to an end.  The home page of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association website is still urging its members not to apply for any of the new positions.  That is the difficult environment in which we live but I congratulate the Minister for sticking with that difficult job.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">I welcome this debate and the opportunity to highlight the plight of approximately 1,100 people in this country who suffer from cystic fibrosis.  In the short time allotted to me I want to deal with the question of CF.  From under the Blackstairs mountains in rural south Carlow I bring my own stories of the experiences of people I know whose lives are defined, tormented and curtailed by this condition.  I do not come to this debate with pat phrases, smart statistics or vapid statements of earnest goodwill.  My party's credentials on this issue are strong.  The Green Party was the only one that acknowledged cystic fibrosis in its recent election manifesto.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Not far from where I live, a brave young man whom I know well successfully underwent a transplant in Newcastle, which gave him a new life.  A few miles further down the road from my home another young man made history by becoming the first Irish patient to have a double lung transplant.  I phoned his mother today to know how he was and he is doing fine.  In my own family, three children of a cousin have cystic fibrosis.  Across the water in my husband's family, another tiny family member has been diagnosed with the condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I am pleased to hear the Government's reiteration in its proposed amendment to the motion that it plans significant capital investment in the area of cystic fibrosis services during 2008 and beyond to improve hospital facilities and isolation units.  This investment is so vital because the level of services, the risk CF sufferers are exposed to due to a lack of isolation units, and the ensuing low life expectancy of Irish cystic fibrosis sufferers — a life expectancy which is over 20 years shorter than those in the United States — are totally unacceptable.  It is also unacceptable in a wealthy country like ours that specialist, isolated care is not afforded to those young people for whom the dice is loaded from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Seven cystic fibrosis sufferers died over Christmas in Ireland.  Recent media coverage of the issue has provoked anger but we should not have to wait for radio and television coverage of our deficient services to kick-start us into action; we should already be busy implementing the recommendations of the Pollock report.  Some facts give us hope that the services required for cystic fibrosis sufferers will be delivered and that their needs will be prioritised.  The appointment of an additional 44 staff to deal with cystic fibrosis sufferers across a number of hospitals is welcome, as is the knowledge that funding for the recruitment of a further 37 is available.  I know the Minister will get them working quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Recently opened facilities in St. Vincent's Hospital for the ambulatory care of cystic fibrosis patients, which provide for segregation for improved infection control, are also greatly welcomed.  The additional beds for respiratory-cystic fibrosis patients in the St. Camillus wards will also go some way to helping them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">I return to the case of a neighbour and constituent of mine whose parents told me today that while their child was small the doctors and nurses treating him in Waterford Hospital's paediatric unit were superb.  The problem, however, was the fear of catching infection in Dublin.  Investment in hospitals in the capital city and around the country for sufferers of cystic fibrosis must be accompanied by well-planned and co-ordinated infection control so that these investments are not undermined.  There is now the political will to implement and deliver the necessary services and comforts for cystic fibrosis patients.  This issue will not be forgotten — not while I can breathe and act on behalf of those who cannot breathe because of cystic fibrosis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">I wish to deal with the area of mental health services.  On 24 January 2006, the expert group on mental health policy, established by the Department of Health and Children, published a new national mental health policy framework, entitled A Vision for Change, which was subsequently adopted by the Government and the Health Service Executive.  It proposed significant changes and improvements in mental health services and a true movement of services into the community.  Regrettably, since the launch of A Vision for Change there has been little or no action to implement it.  Two years later, mental health service users and providers are still struggling with an outdated, fragmented and severely under-resourced system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Mental health and related services remain the areas most neglected by the Government, thus leading to multiple infringements of the human rights of those at risk of mental health problems.  There remains a widespread unavailability of psychological and social interventions as complements to medication, denying the right to the most appropriate and least restrictive or intrusive treatment.  Ireland still has a high rate of hospitalisation for mental health problems due to limited community-based services.  This conflicts with the right to treatment in the least restrictive environment.  Specialist mental health services such as those for people with eating disorders or brain injury, remain generally unavailable outside Dublin, while access in the capital remains very limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">A Vision for Change explicitly stated that a minimum of an additional €25 million was required annually for a six-year period to allow for the implementation of the mental health services expansion and improvement objectives as outlined in the policy.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister of State about the investment.  He informed me that €25 million was made available in 2006 and 2007, yet no extra money is being made available in the third year of a six-year programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1049">Some €25 million was promised in 2006 yet only €17 million went towards developing the priorities set out in A Vision for Change.  In 2007, only €10 million was allocated to the programme.  The remainder was hived off by the Health Service Executive to cater for its deficits elsewhere.  Was the Minister of State informed that was happening?  Perhaps he will deal with that.  While being interviewed on "Prime Time", he was unable to answer how much of the €50 million was spent on the mental health services and the development of A Vision for Change.  Is this what we should expect from someone who has primary responsibility for the area?  The Government cannot pretend that it did not know the funding allocated over the past two years for the development of the mental health services was not delivered.  Blaming the HSE is not an option, as the Minister of State has political responsibility for ensuring the taxpayer's money is spent according to Government policy and he has failed in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">In January the Irish Psychiatric Association published a report entitled, Lie of the Land, which revealed that money released by the State from assets in the mental health service was not being ring-fenced for reinvestment in the psychiatric service.  A Vision for Change stated explicitly, as did two reports going back to the 1960s and accepted by various Governments, that resources, both capital and revenue, should remain within the service.  According to the Irish Psychiatric Association, numerous countrywide examples of diversion of psychiatric services assets from the HSE include St. Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny; St. Dymphna's Hospital, Carlow; Clare mental health services; St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire; Donegal mental health services; Laois mental health services; Longford-Westmeath mental health services; Mayo mental health services; Sligo-Leitrim mental health services; Cavan-Monaghan mental health services; Wicklow mental health services; Tipperary south mental health services; Limerick mental health services; Louth mental health services; and Kerry mental health services.  Did the Minister of State know the HSE was diverting these assets resulting in a loss of mental health services?  This is explicitly contrary to his stated policy but obviously this was done with his acceptance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Why will the report into his examination of this issue be limited to the past two years, given it has been Government policy to ring-fence funding for psychiatric services since 1984?  Resources raised from the sale of surplus psychiatric hospital land should be reinvested and developed in the mental health services.  This approach should include the disposal of all assets associated with psychiatric hospitals since that time.  When does the Minister of State expect to receive the report?  When will it be publicly available?</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">In 2006, 3,000 children and adolescents waited an average of 15 months for assessment, with a number of families waiting as long as four years.  In 2007 waiting lists were even longer, with 3,598 children awaiting assessment, one third of whom had been waiting for more than 12 months.  In 2008, with no money allocated for the implementation of change, the position can only worsen.  A Vision for Change recommended 100 inpatient beds nationally for children and adolescents in five units comprising 20 beds but there is no sign of this happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_1054">Last year, the Minister of State allocated €4.5 million for the implementation of the 1995 report recommendations.  This year, the same amount has been allocated and, therefore, no progress will be made on the implementation of these recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I refer to the issue of suicide.  The Minister of State allocated €4.5 million to suicide prevention this year with 500 people dying by suicide last year, while the Government allocated €44.3 million totally inadequately for the prevention of road traffic deaths, of which there were 338 last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">I attended a serious presentation recently by Professor Paul Mullen on his work in Victoria, New Zealand, in the forensic mental health area.  He is absolutely totally opposed to locating Thornton Hall hospital beside a prison.  He said it was one of the worst decisions the Government has made.  The hospital is a therapeutic institution while the prison is a custodial institution.  The hospital, where the treatment and cure of patients must be the objective, will be stigmatised by its location beside a custodial institution, designed for the containment of people.  Due to its location, it is inevitable the regime and the culture of the hospital will become custodial rather than therapeutic.  I ask the Minister to revisit that decision.  Land is available at the present site of the Central Mental Hospital.  A total of 43 acres are available, of which only 20 are required to build a new state-of-the-art hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">I have received various replies from the HSE to parliamentary questions.  I asked what had happened to the €50 million allocation for mental health services and the HSE replied it was allocated towards the development of A Vision for Change.  However, we know that was not the case because of a Freedom of Information Act request by the Mental Health Alliance, which established this.  I have no confidence in the replies of the HSE to parliamentary questions because the officials are not answering our questions.  They give us a vague overall outline, which is misrepresentative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">I refer to cystic fibrosis.  I acknowledge the services for sufferers of this disease in Limerick.  Isolation wards have been provided courtesy of J.P. McManus and his allocation committee under the chairmanship of John Harty.  Private contributions by this organisation have made this possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">I support the motion fully and, in particular the reference to "the imminent threat to the critical front line hospital services in the north east".  Mr. Finbarr Lennon, consultant general and breast surgeon in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, held high office advising the North Eastern Health Board when it was in place.  He referred in a letter dated 11 December 2007 to another letter he wrote during the general election campaign on 19 June 2007 in which he expressed his concern about the failure of the management authorities at all levels to appreciate the impact and consequences of the current workload and the throughput of cases in the hospital in Drogheda.  Mr. Lennon indicated that in his opinion the situation was "very unsafe" and he called for a fundamental reappraisal of the current strategy being pursued by management regarding acute hospital services in the region.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1060">I have just completed another difficult on-call duty weekend, which has confirmed to me the utter folly of the current management strategy of attempting to increasingly direct all the regional emergency workload into Drogheda, when it clearly is woefully short of basic resources, capacity and some vital expertise.  In my opinion there is no expectation that the hospital can cope no matter what interim structure or working arrangements are put in place.  It is abundantly clear to the vast majority of front line healthcare staff, including local management staff, that the Teamwork Transformation projects have and will inevitably fail.  This is due not only to the fact that the present plan is unrealistic but also because many vital front line staff have been excluded by design from the "so-called consultation process".  Their medical and nursing experience and advice has been largely disregarded by the planners and decision makers.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1061">I have not come across any healthcare colleague in this region who will say that there has been any significant improvement on the ground within any of the three hospitals in Drogheda, Dundalk or Navan in the past 18 months.  Central management's policy of using and depending on external experts and on hand-picked selective advisors to push its agenda has been most unwise and has resulted in peer conflict, dismay and anger throughout the hospital service.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1062">From my perspective as a senior consultant with some management expertise I see no merit in the current course being pursued.  There is no interim solution short of a new regional hospital.  Until such is in place it seems to me that the only safe option is to maintain and resource the three local hospitals to a level sufficient to deliver a safe stand-alone twenty four hour general acute medical service.  In my view it is also prudent at this stage to reconsider and maintain a safe twenty four hour acute general surgical surgery service in Navan.  As things stand there is a perception that both Navan and Dundalk are being deprived of the basic resources necessary to cope with their respective workloads.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1063">The HSE at this juncture should revise its medium term objective for the next two years and concentrate on ensuring all three hospitals are made clean and safe.</p>

          <p eId="para_1067">It was directed to Dr. David Vaughan, chairperson of the medical board in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and was circulated widely.  I understand the Minister for Health and Children and officials of the HSE received copies.  However, they have done nothing about the matter and the hospital is facing an even more serious crisis.  It is appalling, shameful and disgraceful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" eId="spk_443">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I want to take this opportunity to voice my concern about the appalling state of cystic fibrosis services in this country.  As a parent, I count myself lucky to have five healthy children who go to school, play sports and live independent lives.  However, some parents are not as lucky.  In my constituency of Dublin South-Central, I recently met a brave but distraught mother with two young children aged three and six who suffer from cystic fibrosis.  She stays at home to look after them on a 24-seven basis while her husband works hard to support them.  She cannot avail of basic services such as child care, a crèche or even a playschool because her children would not receive the care and attention they require.  When I asked her how she copes, she told me she does the best she can because she has no choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">This Government has failed thousands of parents by not providing the necessary basic services which could help cystic fibrosis patients to lead a normal life.  It is sad to think this debate has come about because two brave young people suffering from cystic fibrosis felt they had no option but to highlight to the media the lack of services and the problems they face on a daily basis.  I know the Minister for Health and Children does not have a crystal ball but I hope to God she has vision because that is what is needed.  Why are cystic fibrosis patients required to contact a radio programme or write to <i>The Irish Times</i> before the Government will act?  If it was not for the courage of these people, I doubt we would be debating this issue now.  Their voices were heard loud and clear by those who listened to “Liveline” or read the newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The Minister needs to take action before more people die unnecessarily.  Cystic fibrosis is Ireland's most common life threatening inherited disease, yet after 11 years the Government has not even started to help suffering patients who struggle on a daily basis.  More than 1,100 people have cystic fibrosis in Ireland, the highest proportion of patients per head of population worldwide.  Unbelievably, the average life expectancy for a person with cystic fibrosis in the Republic of Ireland is 21 years, whereas only an hour away in Northern Ireland people are living to the age of 33 and beyond.  Ireland is at the bottom of the list when it comes to cystic fibrosis and caring for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Unfortunately, this Government operates on a knee-jerk basis.  Suddenly, 120 isolation beds for cystic fibrosis patients have received approval in St. Vincent's hospital.  These beds have been promised for the past ten years and we will have to wait until 2010 before they are in place.  The Minister is only paying lip-service to the crisis.  She must take responsibility and improve the service as a matter of urgency.  I call on her to implement the recommendations of the Pollock report to give people hope and the chance to lead a full and active life.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_1072">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this Fine Gael Private Members' motion highlighting major inadequacies in our health service and I commend Deputy O'Reilly for his sustained efforts to better the lot of patients in our hospitals.  I want to concentrate on the plight of cystic fibrosis sufferers.  The fact that improvements for cystic fibrosis sufferers are dependent on a deal between an Independent Deputy and the Government reveals the bizarre manner in which health services are provided in Ireland and suggests shades of a banana republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">In many ways, the 1,100 cystic sufferers in the Republic of Ireland, including the 39 in County Mayo, have been the forgotten patients in our health service.  It is sad that as well as having to cope with inadequate services, these patients and their families had to undertake a national media campaign to get their plight and the lack of services on the agenda.  We can only imagine the turmoil in the lives of these people as they try to cope with their need for constant care and treatment while having to fight in public for what should be their right.  They are torn between their admiration and appreciation for the nurses and doctors, who give them such great care in impossible and sometimes dangerous circumstances in unsuitable hospital wards, and their frustration at the neglect by the Government over the years of services for cystic fibrosis sufferers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">This morning, I spoke with a parent who was in Mayo General Hospital with her daughter, a cystic fibrosis patient.  In between bringing her other child to school and collecting her at 2 p.m. she had to be in the hospital.  While she was at pains to praise the commitment from the doctors and nurses on the frontline, she also criticised the lack of isolation units in the hospital, the fact that adults have to be treated in the paediatric ward, the danger of cross-infection and the impossible demands placed on the half-time nurse allocated to cystic fibrosis sufferers in the hospital.  The other big fear that cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families have is that even if the Pollock report is implemented, the facilities already in place will be centralised, thereby making a normal life impossible for anyone in the affected families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">I received an e-mail from the parents of two children with cystic fibrosis, one of whom is eight years of age and the other who is 20 months.  The first child was diagnosed within 48 hours of birth and the other was confirmed as having the condition within a month of blood tests being taken after their birth at Mayo General Hospital.  In so far as comparisons could be made with cystic fibrosis cases which attract publicity, these two children have led straightforward lives with few enough complications.  To date, the second child has been hospitalised on one occasion for intravenous antibiotics while the first child has, on average, been hospitalised thrice yearly for the same procedure since they were five.  Both children receive the normal routine care that is associated with the condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The needs of people with cystic fibrosis has attracted much publicity and this was particularly evident in the run-up to the recent general election.  Everyone involved knows about the necessity of isolation wards and en suite facilities.  However, Mayo has only one cystic fibrosis nurse who, like all normal people, needs to take annual leave.  Unfortunately, a void appears when she is on leave.  Earlier this year, one of the children I mentioned earlier was hospitalised when the nurse was on leave and the nurse who normally takes on her duties was ill, with the result that the service was disrupted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Apart from the needs of Mayo General Hospital, other issues need to be addressed.  We are continually told about the dangers of cross-infection, yet the parents of these children are not provided with any option other than hospital visits for their care.  If Professor Drumm and the HSE are genuinely serious about reducing the dependency on hospitalisation, why can the role of the community nurse and the local GP not be integrated into the care of those with cystic fibrosis?  At this stage, the parents simply feel that no one cares about them.  A bell should have rung two years ago when the second child was born but it did not.  The child's condition had to be recorded and the penny should have dropped that they were the second with the condition to be born into the family.  The child's parents were and are devastated but they have received no consideration.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1078">I strongly support the motion and compliment Deputy Reilly on bringing it forward.  The plight of cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families has been completely ignored by successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  The Pollock report was published three years ago and then simply placed on a shelf and forgotten.  Three years is a long time in anyone's life but for a person suffering from cystic fibrosis it is an eternity.  The Government's attitude to the Pollock report sums up its overall attitude to cystic fibrosis.  Those in the Republic who suffer from this condition have a life expectancy that is ten years less than their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  This is a damning indictment and unless the Government changes its attitude, it will remain so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I recently met representatives of the association which represents cystic fibrosis sufferers in County Clare.  The group has a number of questions to which it requires answers.  First, when will a cystic fibrosis specialist consultant be appointed at Limerick Regional Hospital?  This appointment has been promised for many years but nothing has happened.  Second, when will the two additional nurse specialists be appointed at Limerick Regional Hospital?  Third, when will additional adult isolation units to cater for the requirements of cystic fibrosis patients be built at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick?</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">It is simply not acceptable that patients, particularly those with cystic fibrosis, should be obliged to travel long distances in order to avail of specialist facilities.  The level of specialist resources is limited.  While I welcome the proposed provision of 14 new rooms at St. Vincent's Hospital, this progress must be mirrored outside the Pale.  A key recommendation of the Pollock report is that adequately staffed, fully equipped cystic fibrosis support centres be located throughout the country.  What is the state of play as regards this recommendation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I am asking that a cystic fibrosis specialist unit similar to the unit for children built, with the assistance of money donated by J. P. McManus, at Limerick Regional Hospital be developed for adult cystic fibrosis sufferers at the same location.  Why is it that during Ireland's so-called Celtic tiger boom, private money was used to build the facility to which I refer?  The Government must use the fruits of the Celtic tiger to provide facilities for adult cystic fibrosis sufferers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">I recently spoke to the parent of a young boy from County Clare who sufferers from cystic fibrosis.  He informed me that he was going to purchase an apartment in Belfast in order to avail of the services available in Northern Ireland, which are far ahead of those on offer in the Republic.  One must own a house or residence in Northern Ireland to gain access to the services there.  This man is being forced to do this in order to prolong the life of his child.  He informed me that one thing cystic fibrosis sufferers do not have is time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">It is time the Minister took action in the interests of the people concerned who are crying out for help and for the Pollock report to be implemented.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_446">
          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1084">I support the motion.  We are discussing cystic fibrosis and the need for psychiatric assistance for young people.  I wish to refer first to cystic fibrosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The campaign relating to cystic fibrosis has been highlighted on Joe Duffy's "Liveline", in national and local newspapers, on local radio stations and on "Prime Time" and "The Late Late Show" in recent weeks.  The Government has failed to implement the recommendations of the Pollock report.  All the Minister, Deputy Harney, and her numerous Ministers of State need do in respect of this matter is examine what is happening in Northern Ireland and other European Union countries and consider the facilities that are available for cystic fibrosis sufferers in these jurisdictions.  As Deputy Joe Carey stated, the one thing cystic fibrosis sufferers do not have is time.  The Government has been in power for ten years and has failed to provide assistance for cystic fibrosis sufferers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">I listened with interest to the comments made by Deputy White who has been totally whitewashed.  It is amazing that she stated she was satisfied that adequate funding would be provided for facilities for cystic fibrosis sufferers in the coming years.  I assure the Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, that if Deputy White was on this side of the House, she would be shouting loudly at Members on the Government side.  I am jealous that her party is in government.  However, I have standards and would not like to be in government just for the sake of it.  That is the position in which the Green Party finds itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">On psychiatric facilities, particularly those for younger people, I was visited by a parent at my clinic last Saturday.  Deputy Collins stated that, in the context of the health service, everything was not all doom and gloom.  I invite him to visit my clinic, which lasts one and a half hours, next Saturday.  I will even pay for his train or bus journey or perhaps he may wish to drive to Enniscorthy.  I will provide him with examples that everything relating to the health service is all doom and gloom.  I have no doubt that he was provided with a lovely script by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  As the Minister was not present to read her script, she gave it to the Deputy who did a fine job of reading it into the record.  The people of County Limerick will be very proud of him.  However, those within the health service who face real difficulties will not be too happy with him.  He is a yes man and afraid to stand up and be counted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I commend Deputy Conlon for what she said.  However, I must ask if will she vote with the Opposition or the Government.  I have no doubt that it will be the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">A 15 year old girl in the children's ward in Wexford General Hospital has been waiting four weeks to be transferred to a child-adolescent bed in a psychiatric hospital in Dublin.  I accept that the Minister of State will not be able to provide an answer this evening but perhaps he or an official from the Department of Health and Children might indicate at a later date the number of child-adolescent beds available throughout the country.  If he could communicate further with me on this matter, I would be grateful.  I have been informed that there are eight such beds.  I do not want to believe that is the case.  If there are only eight child-adolescent beds, it is a matter of shame for the Government which has been in power for ten years.  What should I say to the parent of the child to whom I refer?  What would Deputy Collins say to the individual in question?  He is of the view that everything is okay but I am not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">I have attacked the Green Party in recent weeks and will continue to do so because its members have no standards whatsoever.  I commend the motion to the House and congratulate Deputy Reilly on bringing it forward.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_1091">I welcome the opportunity to conclude the debate on behalf of the Government and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  It has focused on developments in cystic fibrosis services and mental health services, in particular.  Many points were made in respect of general health issues and local concerns.  From the contributions of my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Devins and Hoctor, and statements made by the Minister, it must be clear that the Government is committed to building services for people with cystic fibrosis and mental health services and that we are ensuring actions are taken to meet that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">On Thursday afternoon last the Minister dealt with these issues at Question Time, when many of the same points were raised and debated.  There is no discourtesy intended to the House or the Opposition in the Minister being away on official business this week.  Her trip was organised by the Department several months ago in response to specific invitations.  Fine Gael, as is normal for official business abroad, accorded the Minister the facility of a pair for the week.  I acknowledge the co-operation of Deputy Kehoe in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The substance of the debate is the most important aspect.  In that context and since the publication of the Pollock report, the Minister and the Government have made available almost €7 million in additional funding for the development of services for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  This has led to the recruitment of 44 new specialist staff across nine hospitals and we look forward to 37 further staff members being recruited with the funding available.  It is acknowledged that, as the recommendations in the Pollock report are being implemented, these new staff are beginning to make improvements to services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The Minister and the Government have made the correct funding and policy decisions in response to the Pollock report.  It is now about implementation.  We all want to see new facilities put in place at hospitals like St. Vincent's in Dublin as rapidly as possible.  None of us finds conditions for cystic fibrosis patients acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">This and previous Governments have wanted to see a fast pace of capital developments, once political approval has been given for funding.  This is not confined to capital works for cystic fibrosis services but goes across the board, and beyond health too.  We know there are legal and technical constraints on the speed of capital works, but the Minister, the Government, and the HSE management are determined to ensure capital funding under the national development plan is used rapidly and efficiently for the strategic purposes decided at political level.  The HSE has assured the Minister it now has the capacity to make full use of its significant capital allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">In regard to cystic fibrosis, St. Vincent's Hospital and the HSE are acting in accordance with the public and political desire to see as fast a pace of capital development as possible.  We are certainly making progress and I am confident the new dedicated facilities at St. Vincent's for cystic fibrosis patients will be put in place quickly, and that innovative ways of making the earliest possible progress this year will be implemented, as the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, outlined last evening.  This will result, for example, in a total of 14 single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">In regard to mental health, it is not the case that many sites have been sold by the HSE since A Vision for Change was adopted by Government, with the capital receipts supposedly lost to mental health services.  The only property where a transaction has been completed is St. Loman's in Dublin and the €38 million involved will contribute to funding mental health capital developments under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">New developments will include, for example, a new acute psychiatric unit at Letterkenny General Hospital.  The HSE has informed me it expects to have the design work completed so as to be able to go to market for construction tenders by the end of this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The Government and HSE are fully committed to implementing A Vision for Change.  This report and its acceptance by Government in 2006 is a major milestone in the development of mental health services.  The Government has given priority to the area in funding decisions and in the appointment of my colleague, Deputy Devins, to the area as Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">I assure the House he is determined to ensure funding allocated by Government to mental health is actually used fully for mental health services.</p>

For example, admissions to Irish psychiatric units and hospitals are continuing to decline from 25,985 in 1997 to 20,288 in 2006 — a 22% decrease.  The introduction of the Mental Health Commission has also been a significant step forward for patients.</p>

          <p eId="para_1108">I thank my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, for giving me the opportunity to again discuss the important health issues regarding lack of services to the disabled, those with mental health issues and those with cystic fibrosis etc.  In the few minutes available I will speak specifically about the real cutbacks in the north east.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">The Minister for Health and Children and Professor Drumm have given many commitments that no services would be removed until as good or better services become available.  In recent weeks, however, two consultants have been removed from Monaghan General Hospital as well as beds, so the treatment room there can no longer give the same full service.  This in turn means patients will have to go to Cavan, Drogheda or even Dublin.  These are patients who in the past were dealt with perfectly well and safely in Monaghan General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">Mr. Finbarr Lennon, senior consultant, with full knowledge of the north east, has clearly stated that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is incapable of dealing with its present numbers and is currently unsafe.  Yet the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm insist on carrying on with the implementation of the Hanly report under the guise of the teamwork operational programme, which Mr. Lennon argues is unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">At this late stage I beg that the Minister, Deputy Harney, preferably in the absence of Professor Drumm, sit down with the elected Members of the north-east region to work out a realistic way forward.  Surely the Minister can no longer oversee the wanton waste at management and other levels within the HSE while services are being wound down at all the five hospitals in the north east.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I am glad to hear my colleague, Deputy Margaret Conlon, making a statement in the House.  I know if she is to carry through on her contribution, she will vote with us on this side.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Medical cards are being removed because of a lack of finance in the north east and even being refused for seriously ill patients.  The last straw in mismanagement was when the President recently opened a facility in Monaghan for the adult handicapped. Although it had been built for two years by Mr. Dan Rogan and the Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped, no staff was appointed to run the centre.  In that context, the only three available beds for respite of young handicapped are now in the process of being removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">We do not expect to have a Beaumont or Blackrock Clinic type of hospital in Monaghan but we deserve to be treated as human beings and be guaranteed, as the Minister promised, that services will be retained until better is available.  I have no wish to see the HSE running over budget but I humbly suggest that it is not the closure of Monaghan General Hospital or taking it off call that will solve the problem in the long term.  We need a real reconfiguration of management and administrative structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">The former Minister responsible for health, Deputy Michéal Martin, organised 150 reports and inquiries, with 115 of these costing €32 million.  We have no costings for the others.  How many reports and inquiries has the current Minister instigated and at what cost?</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The Indecon report on pharmacists, sponsored by the Government, was brought in but completely ignored.  In a reply last night on the pharmacist issue, the Minister indicated her wish to find a way of reaching new arrangements, adapting what has been a traditional process to arrive at a revised pricing arrangement.  The Minister has no arrangements as such with the pharmacists and it is a disgrace.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_1118">I thank everybody in the House who contributed to this debate, as these are very important issues.  I welcome the members of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland in the Gallery who have come from Rush.  I know it took much effort on their part to be here.  Every time these people go out they are exposed to more infection, so I appreciate their being here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">We discussed cystic fibrosis last night in the Chamber.  It is clear we have the highest incidence of this life-threatening illness in the world, with more than 1,100 cases in the country.  We have the worst prognosis in western Europe, with people suffering from cystic fibrosis in this country dying ten years younger than their counterparts in the UK or even up the road in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">There are many reasons for this, which we discussed last night, such as lack of neonatal screening, proper homecare support, isolation beds for treatment in hospital and isolation facilities when those suffering from the disease attend accident and emergency departments.  There is also a lack of a specialist centre in St. Vincent's.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The main reason for the problem is a lack of isolation rooms and the danger of cross-infection.  We have no reference laboratory in this country funded by the State, although there is one working on a voluntary basis in Tallaght.  That is run by Dr. Philip Murphy and financed by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. It is the only lab capable of checking and growing different species of a bug called cepacia, which is very often fatal for people with cystic fibrosis.  Once people have contracted this bug, they are no longer considered eligible for a lung transplant because the outcome is not as good.  The lab should be funded by the HSE so the burden of funding can be taken away from the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland.  This will protect patients from the bug but if they are unfortunate enough to contract it, we can check for the multiplicity of antibiotics that must be used in combination to treat it successfully.  Most labs in the country do not check for that bug.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">We need neonatal screening and high-frequency oscillating vests, which are applicable to certain people with cystic fibrosis.  For them, it could save significant amounts of money for physiotherapy.  We require proper home support.  These are brave young outspoken people, and all they are asking of the Minister and this State is to be given a fighting chance against this life-threatening illness.  I ask the Minister to commit tonight to delivering the service to these people within a real deadline, unlike other commitments in the past.  It is particularly disappointing that 82% of sufferers have not seen any significant improvement since the Pollock report was published three years ago, that they are still exposed to cross-infection and that the too little, too late approach continues with talk of 14 rooms in St. Mark's ward by the end of the summer, while we wait almost three more years for a dedicated unit at St. Vincent's.  It is not satisfactory, particularly when there are 18 patients with cystic fibrosis in St. Vincent's and ten more on the waiting list, making a total of 28.  Plans are no substitute for action and promises do not save lives, only service does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I told the Minister of State last night that there is a company in Tyrone which can build modular units in four months and has already done so at various sites around the city for the Department of Health and Children.  Will he use the unspent money to engage these contractors to build these modular units, particularly at St. Vincent's and at the other sites, as promised by the Minister, in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and north Dublin?  That is the solution.  There should be no more reports or experts.  The Minister should just do this and give these young people a fighting chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Mental health patients are treated in atrocious conditions, particularly in St. Ita's where 23 people on the male admission ward and the female admission ward are cared for in an open dormitory in conditions similar to those that existed in Romania under Ceausescu.  These patients are in an open ward.  This is 2008, not 1908.  The building was built over 30 years ago as a temporary measure and I have nothing but admiration for the doctors, nurses and care staff who work there.  It is a credit to them that there has not been a serious injury or fatal incident in the hospital.  It is unbelievable that 23 patients are treated in an open ward with 3 ft between the beds.  A lady there was nearly smothered by another patient who came back from day leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">People are infuriated that the delay is connected with the psychiatric unit at Beaumont.  This was promised over 20 years ago and was built but then used for the overflow from the medical wards.  The attitude was that the psychiatry patients could wait.  Planning permission was granted in 2004 for a new building and it went out to tender in 2005.  How many millions of euro were spent on that planning application?  A co-located hospital is to be built on part of that site rendering that planning permission null and void.  People who are mentally ill go to the back of the queue because they are the least important to the Government.  That is how it treats the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">It is galling that people who live in Artane and Killester have to drive by Beaumont Hospital to the far end of the peninsula at Portrane to seek treatment in a Dickensian building.  We want the money that will be realised from the assets of the psychiatric institutions ring-fenced for psychiatry and mental health, and the money promised for the implementation of A Vision for Change used for that purpose, not to meet daily costs.  Above all, I want to see a deadline for a completion date for a psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital.  That is the least my constituents and those of Dublin North-East expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">Last night I alluded to the terrible cutbacks taking place all over the country and the failed and broken promises of the Government, particularly the Minister for Health and Children.  First, they said there would be no cutbacks, then that cutbacks would not hurt patients, then they introduced a raft of cutbacks and delayed operations, which continues.  According to an article in last night's <i>Evening Echo</i>, nurses will be asked to take six weeks’ unpaid leave.  The HSE is €370 million short.  Every time it plans to save money it does so at the patients’ expense.  There is never a question of increasing efficiencies within its bungling burgeoning bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">We do not have the capacity to meet the demand but we can resolve this in two ways, one, reduce demand by instituting preventative care in the community through general practices.  A national body test would prevent illness or pick it up early and make major savings.  Every euro spent on prevention would save €20 on treatment.  This could be achieved through one-stop shops in the community where there are groups of general practitioners with nursing staff, physiotherapists, X-ray and ultra sound facilities, rooms for visiting consultants to see patients, and endoscopy, the camera that examines the upper and lower bowel.  That can be done in the community, keeping people away from hospital.  The Minister should bring the service to the people where they want it in comfortable, familiar surroundings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">There are more people like Susie Long and the waiting list for a colonoscopy remains several months in many parts of the country.  More people will die through Government inaction.  Real action can keep people out of hospital and would not cost a great deal.  It would be much cheaper to do this in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The second part of this action is to increase the capacity of the hospitals by two mechanisms.  We need more beds.  Even PA Consulting, commissioned by the Government, reported a few weeks ago that we need 1,200 beds and we will need many more if we do not change the way we do business.  That is the purpose of the preventative early intervention course in the community.  The 57,000 bed-days lost in the Mater and Beaumont hospitals last year alone are equivalent to a 150-bed hospital.  Moving those patients into the community would free up the equivalent of a new hospital.  That could be done within six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">There are people in private enterprise who are planning to build nursing homes.  They only want to know whether the patients will come and they will deliver.  Patients should not be stacked in nursing homes.  There should be physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy so that the patients can continue their rehabilitation close to their families and loved ones and eventually go home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, who was here earlier tonight but has left, said he was disgusted that Fine Gael would raise the issue of the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, from the country during this debate.  He said that her trip was organised several months ago, as the Minister for State, Deputy Gallagher, also said.  If that is so, why does it not appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which informs us of where Ministers will be when the rotas are being drawn up?  It is not there.  No major event is taking place.  This is a fact-finding mission.  We are up to our gills in reports and we have experts coming out our ears.  The Minister has gone to study cancer services, having brought a new cancer expert into the country.  We do not need more experts or reports, we need action and leadership.</p>

          <p eId="para_1134">I will tell the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, who is not here, what disgusts me: that people with cystic fibrosis die ten years younger than they do 50 miles up the road; that Beverly Seville Doyle, a 39 year old, died alone in a toilet in an accident and emergency department; that psychotic patients cannot get secure beds and put themselves and others at risk; that the people of Dublin North and Dublin North-East are treated on an open ward with 22 other patients and very little dignity, at great risk to themselves and staff, while private enterprise builds a co-located hospital on a site that was designated for a modern unit for their care; that 400 people were lying on trolleys only two weeks ago; that countless thousands of people are on long waiting lists for operations; that fungus grows on the wall of an old pre-fabricated building in Balbriggan where nurses take blood from mentally ill patients; and that children are admitted to adult psychiatric wards.  That is what disgusts me and many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">We need a Minister who will act.  The technology and the people are available, what we lack is a Minister who is prepared to act, to show leadership, to stay here and fight for patients and put them first instead of going to the other side of the Atlantic.  This week has shown yet again that the Minister is disinterested, disconnected, disengaged and has forgotten what leadership involves.  We are hoarse on this side of the House shouting for action.  Patients are dying waiting for it.  The Minister should cut out the vacillation and procrastination, spend the money, sort out the HSE, act, build the units, give the people the health service for which they have worked so hard and paid so much tax over the past ten years.  Let us not watch our bright young cystic fibrosis sufferers die ten years younger than those 50 miles up the road.</p>

            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_1397">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this important issue.  The Cork docklands area has the potential to deliver 25,000 jobs to the city and to attract 20,000 people to live in a revitalised, modern environment.  The regeneration project has the potential to transform Cork in a similar fashion to that achieved with the regeneration of the docklands in Dublin and London.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">People in Cork hoped that tax incentives for the docklands project would be announced by the Minister for Finance in last December's budget, but this was not the case.  We were given to understand by members of the Minister's party that the Finance Bill, which is the vehicle for delivering targeted tax incentives, would provide for measures to support development in the area.  On its publication last week, however, we discovered that it had failed to deliver.  Our substantial expectations were encouraged by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who said at the end of last year that it could be taken as given that the Department of Finance would respond, through the Finance Bill, to the submissions received.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">The Bill ignores the Cork docklands.  The Government has missed an important opportunity and, through its inaction, will delay a project that has very significant potential and is vital for the future sustainable development of the region.  It is difficult to accept that the Government has any commitment to Cork.  It makes agreeable statements but there is no positive action.  The national development plan states that a key challenge for Cork in the period to 2013 will be to accelerate significantly its rate of development and population growth, focusing particularly on the potential of its central area.  It goes on to sate that the docklands area, in particular, "has a capacity to accommodate an additional population of at least 15,000 and significant floor space, but investment in physical infrastructure to trigger subsequent private investment is necessary".  So far, however, there has been no commitment to accelerate any development in the Cork docklands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">For the past five years, the local authorities in Cork have promoted the area and have succeeded in gaining recognition for the regeneration plan as a priority in the national development plan and the spatial strategy.  In addition, the Government's submission to the EU included a recommendation that it be included in the EU regional aid map.  It is now up to the Government to progress the project.  The lack of support from that quarter is worrying.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">There has been an indication from the EU that aid may not be provided to relocate hazardous substance sites.  However, while this matter is being examined, there are many other ways in which the Government could offer support, such as through the provision of infrastructure and through support for the provision of premises for targeted sectors and for the development of residential owner occupation.  Cork has been designated as a gateway, one of nine, in the national development plan.  The gateway innovation fund could be used to provide necessary infrastructure in the docklands area.  However, the funding allocation in the budget is small and will have little impact.  The national development plan includes a commitment that €300 million will be provided for this purpose for the years 2008 to 2010.  Only €40 million was provided in last year's budget, however, and there is no guarantee that any of this money will go to Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">There is significant disappointment and anger in Cork at the Government's apparent indifference to the docklands project.  I acknowledge the efforts made by my colleague, Deputy Allen, to highlight the importance of this project.  This disappointment and anger is felt not only by those of us in Opposition but also by the Cork Chamber of Commerce, business interests in Cork and all those who are ambitious for their city and wish to see it achieve its potential in the context of national development.  I seek a commitment from the Government that it will provide the necessary targeted tax incentives to ensure this project can commence.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Noel Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1403">From what I know of this project, any delay is largely a question of timing.  Some of Deputy Clune's comments are wide of the mark and premature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The Cork docklands area is set in a strategic location to the east of Cork city centre and covers 166 hectares of land.  The potential of the area was initially recognised in the 1990s, culminating in the publication of the Cork docklands development strategy in 2001.  This set out a vision for a new urban quarter characterised by high-quality design with residential, employment and leisure opportunities.  In overall terms, the report highlighted that the area constituted a superb quality of life in a high-density urban setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">During a visit to Cork on 23 November last, the Taoiseach announced the formal establishment of the Cork Docklands Development Forum as "a hugely significant step in the development of Cork's docklands as a residential, economic and cultural centre to rival anywhere in Europe".  The overall objective of the forum, which is chaired by Professor Gerry Wrixon, a former president of University College Cork, is to oversee and drive the development of the Cork docklands area by bringing together senior representatives of key Departments and the local authorities, in addition to stakeholders from community and business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">The broad range of experience of the participants will ensure the redeveloped docklands will become a new hub of activity for all Cork people.  The work of the forum is ongoing and officials from the Departments of Finance, the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are engaged on a cross-departmental approach to expedite its work in partnership with the relevant local stakeholders.  The forum has already met on several occasions and is due to report back to the Government by June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">The regeneration of the Cork docklands area is highlighted in the national development plan, which recognises that the area has the capacity to accommodate an additional residential population of at least 15,000 people, including a mix of both social and affordable housing units.  The regeneration of the area will also result in significant commercial activity with associated job creation opportunities.  The national development plan also recognises that investment in physical infrastructure to trigger subsequent private investment in the area is necessary.  In particular, the plan identifies the need for priority investment in roads, water services, port relocation and associated infrastructure to facilitate the Cork docklands regeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The case for the regeneration of the area was also recognised by the Government as early as 1999 when a significant area in the docklands was designated for tax reliefs under the 1999 urban renewal scheme.  It is accepted, however, that for a variety of reasons, no significant development took place in the areas designated under that scheme.  In advance of this year's budget, Cork City Council proposed several tax incentives to assist the regeneration of the Cork docklands.  The proposals included the remediation of contaminated land, relocation of land uses incompatible with regeneration, provision of key infrastructure by the private sector, provision of premises for targeted knowledge-based and high-value sectors, and incentives for residential owner occupiers and investors.  Given the nature of the proposals, particularly those relating to the remediation of contaminated land and the relocation of land uses, it is understood it is highly unlikely that the overall package of reliefs as proposed by Cork City Council would be approved by the European Commission under the relevant state aid guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">Although the European Commission approved the Cork docklands and some of the adjoining areas as being eligible for regional aid under the state aid map for the period 2007-13, this does not mean that the area can qualify for all of the reliefs that have been proposed to date.  In fact, the Commission's state aid map, in effect, simply places an upper ceiling on the level of aid that can be awarded in a specific assisted area.  It should also be borne in mind that any decision to provide tax incentives for any specific location, such as the docklands, must take a number of factors into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, when introducing Second Stage of the Finance Bill yesterday, reiterated his recent comments on the use of tax incentives for the development of Cork docklands.  As Deputies will recall, he stated that the Cork project is at the beginning of a process of evaluation and that we would need to assess how best to devise proposals that would meet European Commission state aid requirements.  He went on to say that the docklands is an exciting project but at this stage, it is very much a work in progress.  He indicated that an early announcement may not assist in clarifying some of the outstanding issues that have yet to be resolved between the various stakeholders locally.  He said that the Cork docklands forum is expected to report by the middle of this year and that he remains open to looking at ways in which the tax code can be used creatively to encourage investment and change behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">It should be noted that the Tánaiste appreciates that due to its unique location and potential, the regeneration of the docklands is both a regional and a national priority.  That means that the Deputy is a little early in raising her concerns, that many things need to be done locally first, that the proposal can be improved and that it may be considered next year.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_460">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1412">The ongoing scale of death as a result of road traffic accidents in rural Ireland was again brought home to us in the past week with a number of tragedies around the country.  Hardly a week goes by in rural Ireland in which there is not a fatal accident on a secondary road.  While there are many factors involved, I raise this matter to draw attention to the need for clear road markings and signage as I am aware of a number of cases in which these have been factors in road deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">I wish to read into the record a letter I received from a family bereaved as a result of such a tragedy:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1414">On the 22/4/06 our daughter Eileen Keane and boyfriend Trevor Chute were in a fatal accident at Ardoughter, Ballyduff, Tralee, Co. Kerry.  There was no signage or road markings at this junction.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1415">This accident was investigated by . . . PSV inspector at Tralee Garda Station and [an official from] "Kerry Co Council".  The inquest was to be heard on 20 October 2006 but was cancelled while a file was sent to the DPP. [There was another vehicle involved.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1416">The night before Eileen's inquest our liaison officer [at Tralee Garda Station] explained procedures to take place on the 2 Feb 2007.  We were led to believe that the investigating officer . . . would be present.  His findings nor [those of the Kerry County Council official] who both witnessed the scene were not read out.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1417">[The Kerry County Council official] was at the scene at approx 10.40 pm.  The Garda never informed us of our tragic loss which took place at approx 9.40 pm.  We got a text from our daughter Marion that there had been a crash.  This was confirmed at 11.00 pm. [when we contacted Listowel Garda Station and found out that our daughter Eileen was dead along with her boyfriend Trevor].</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1418">Some period after the inquest and tragic loss of Eileen we went looking for answers.  We were seeking transparency and accountability.  We have wrote numerous correspondence to Kerry Co Council [and] each time our requests have been refused.  We have also written to other Government bodies that refer us back to Kerry Co. Council (still no answers).</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">The parents have aired some of their views, and those of their family, on local radio and in the local papers.  They said it is like being in a maze with no way out and that they are still looking for closure and would be grateful for any little help on this long, lonely and never-ending road.  The letter was signed by Richard and Kay Keane.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">A number of years ago I dealt with a similar case in County Mayo.  Again, it took years before there was a resolution, or the family in question got justice.  It is vital that road signage and markings are laid out clearly, especially on the more dangerous roads where vehicles are likely to travel at higher speeds, despite the roads on which they are travelling, and where there is a more than the usual number of hazards.  It is also important that the relevant authorities take responsibility for the maintenance of roads and road markings as, unfortunately, this has been a matter of dispute in certain cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">People who have lost loved ones in tragic circumstances, such as the parents who wrote the above letter, are entitled to answers.  Unfortunately, because of bureaucracy and what would appear to be non-activity by the local authorities and Government bodies, there has been a passing of the buck from one to the other.  People need answers and they are entitled to them.  They have lost loved ones and they continue to grieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">The father and mother who wrote the letter to which I have referred say they are looking for closure on this long, lonely and never-ending road and that it is like being in a maze.  Their situation can be replicated throughout the country where people have lost loved ones on lonely country roads on which there is a lack of signage and proper markings for which nobody is prepared to take responsibility.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_461">
          <from>Deputy Noel Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1423">I thank Deputy Ferris for raising the matter.  There has been a 20% drop in deaths on Irish roads since the launch of the Government's first road safety strategy in 1998.  This has been achieved despite a 52% increase in the number of vehicles on our roads.  Over the past year we have seen a distinct improvement in our road safety performance with 2007 resulting in the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">My reply to the Deputy is very much from a strategic point of view and I accept that sometimes quoting statistics is of very little value to people like the Deputy's constituents who have had a tragedy in the family.  One death is one too many.  The reply may not give comfort to the family about which the Deputy spoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">The collective goal of all of those involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety policies is to ensure that the improvements achieved in recent years are sustained and built on.  Significant initiatives realised over the lifetime of the two previous road safety strategies and, in particular, over the last two years, include the extension of penalty points and fixed charge systems, stronger legislation, mandatory roadside alcohol testing, increased levels of enforcement and, in September 2006, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">The road safety strategy for the period 2007-12 was launched last October and sets out the direction on road safety for the next five years.  It is the outcome of detailed research and consultation with stakeholders by the Road Safety Authority.  The purpose of the strategy is to reduce death and injuries on all Irish roads and in doing so, bring us into line with best practice countries.  It will consolidate the reductions in deaths in 2006 and 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">It is estimated that in the lifetime of this strategy, approximately 400 lives will be saved and Ireland will move closer to becoming one of the best practice countries in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">The development of the strategy by the Road Safety Authority, following a comprehensive public consultation process, has the support of the public.  A total of 126 actions are outlined and the focus is on delivery and outcomes with built-in targets and accountability.  The strategy addresses and puts in place actions to deliver many of the items which people have called for in recent years and which have a proven road safety dividend.  Indeed, many of the actions set out in the strategy are either directly or indirectly focused on improving road safety on rural roads.  I heard what the Deputy said about road signs and road markings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">The core objective of the strategy is to reduce road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million population by the end of 2012, with demonstrable downward reductions in each year of the strategy.  One of the actions set out in the strategy to reduce road deaths relates to changes in our driver licensing system.  The introduction of a new learner permit on 30 October for all new first time licence applicants as well as those renewing their provisional licence after that date is a key building stone in the introduction of a graduated licensing system for Ireland.  The aim of the system is to reduce the number of collisions, deaths and injuries among novice drivers during the learning process, particularly the high risk 17 to 24 year old age group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">The strategy also identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal blood alcohol level for drivers.  The Government has accepted that recommendation.  The precise level to which the blood alcohol level will be lowered will follow consideration of the outcome of research being carried out by the Road Safety Authority.  The target date for completion of this measure in the strategy is the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">On the engineering side, the National Roads Authority will invest €1.25 billion for each year of the strategy on major inter-urban projects and will develop a new inter-urban network of motorways and dual carriageways from Dublin to Galway,  Limerick, Cork and Waterford by 2010.  However, I realise that the Deputy is referring to non-national roads and local roads.  I accept that almost 45% of deaths are caused on those roads, whereas much of the investment is going into the motorways and the national roads.  The aspects about which the Deputy speaks relate to local roads and there are too many deaths on those roads.  Those items do not cost millions or trillions of euro and they should be carried out.  I cannot quote the specifics out of the 126 headings of the strategy which refer to that, but I heard what the Deputy has said and I will report back his points.</p>

          <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" eId="spk_462">
            <from>Deputy Rory O’Hanlon</from>
            <p eId="para_1432">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the loss of 130 jobs at Grove Turkeys in Smithboro, County Monaghan.  It is devastating for the workers, their families and the local community with all the consequences of unemployment.  There is also an impact for 85 farmers on both sides of the Border who are the producers, as well as for the contractors who support those producers.  The main problem is the inability to compete with low-cost countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">The main problem for the poultry industry — a very important industry in my constituency, especially in County Monaghan — is the cost of feed, which has increased by €150 per tonne in recent years.  There is increased global demand and much of the land is being used for bio-fuel, although it is important we do not end up in a situation where we have petrol for our cars but no bread.  The pig industry also suffers from the high cost of feed and that is also an important industry in my own constituency.  We cannot compete with cheap imports coming into the country, especially from Brazil.  In recent times, the devaluation of sterling by 12% against the euro has had a major impact.  The problems are not confined to Ireland because the number of turkeys killed in the UK have been reduced from 45 million to 15 million in the past ten years.  The question is what needs to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for coming to the House to take the question.  The issue of food labelling rests with her Department.  There is no doubt the consumer prefers Irish produce.  It is important that when they go to the supermarket they can identify it.  There must be labelling so they can identify the country of origin.  There are two markets in Ireland for turkeys.  There is a seasonal market at Christmas and Easter where people like a fresh turkey.  We are well able to compete in this market.  However, for the remainder of the year we deal with cheaper commodity poultry and we cannot compete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I ask the Minister of State to speak to her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to ensure the workers at Grove Turkeys have every opportunity to find new jobs.  I call on the State agencies that have a role to play to do urgently what needs to be done.  This includes skills assessments and retraining if necessary.  IDA Ireland owns land in Monaghan town and perhaps the time is right to build an advance factory and new office space.  The county council economic sub-group should get the support of all the resources in the State that are necessary to ensure new jobs are found for these workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">There has been substantial investment in Monaghan in recent years, especially in roads.  One can now drive from Monaghan town to Dublin without passing through a town or a village.  There has also been investment in education, especially DKIT in Dundalk, as well as in buildings in the county such as M-Tek 1 and M-Tek 2.  Monaghan was never more attractive for the creation of new industry and I hope there will be work for those who are losing their employment in Grove Turkeys.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryWallace" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_463">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
            <p eId="para_1437">I regret the announced job losses and hope those affected will find alternative employment.  The firm's decision is part of a rationalisation programme to secure the future of the company in the face of market changes and intense competition from overseas producers.  This will see the firm move to a seasonal production cycle supplying the peak Easter and Christmas markets, although it will also continue with some added value poultry processing.  Talks are in process with the turkey producers involved about the new arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">The developments at this company illustrate the very competitive nature of the poultry sector.  However, it has shown exceptional resilience in recent years.  It recovered from the consumer concerns centred on avian influenza in 2006 and has managed to absorb the high feed costs evident over the past year.  In fact, there was a 3% growth in output in 2007. Competitiveness remains a significant problem, however.  The Irish poultry sector is small by international standards, accounting for just over 1% of total EU output.  It does not enjoy the economies of scale enjoyed by other EU countries while it is also the case that imports from non-EU countries have also had a significant impact on the market.  In the case of turkeys, the relatively seasonal nature of demand has been another constraint on the development of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">The industry has and must remain market oriented.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will continue to take the steps open to her to assist the development of the sector.  A number of recent initiatives have been taken and I believe these will be of significant benefit.  The poultry expert group was established with the objective of examining the main factors impacting on the viability of the poultry industry.  It was asked to draw up relevant action points.  The group included representatives of the producers, processors, feed suppliers and relevant State agencies.  The final report of the group contains recommendations on matters such as labelling, animal welfare, environmental protection and feedstuffs.  That report is under consideration and will be published shortly on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Deputy O'Hanlon spoke of the importance of origin labelling.  This is a matter of considerable interest to Irish poultry producers and consumers.  The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, has drafted national regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on poultry, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  This legislation was notified to the European Commission which, along with other member states, has until 14 March to comment on the proposed legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has written to Commissioner Fischer Boel to reinforce the case for country of origin labelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The Bord Bia poultry quality assurance scheme has been instrumental in consolidating the position of Irish poultry on the domestic market and has helped to alleviate concerns and confusion regarding the quality and sourcing of poultry.  This year Bord Bia plans to upgrade the chicken quality scheme to the EN45011 standard which will provide further independent endorsement of the quality of Irish poultry.  Other measures include a package of financial assistance that was made available in 2006 and 2007 to broiler producers who were forced to cut back on throughput due to the avian influenza scare.  In addition, the intensive livestock group established by the Department is examining possible solutions to manure disposal problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, appreciates fully that the poultry industry will continue to face a very competitive environment.  While it may seem little consolation to those affected by these job losses, she is confident that the industry can meet its challenges.  Allied to the measures outlined above, I believe that the sector can continue to benefit from its knowledge of the home market and the consumer preference — to some extent at least — for Irish produce.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for raising the topic.  We will continue to pursue the issues he has stressed, such as origin labelling, as the points he has made are very important as regards the domestic market.</p>

I had hoped it would not need to be selected, as I had been anticipating an announcement a fortnight ago as regards this primary school.  I have put this matter on the record of the Dáil before, but I shall give some of the facts again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">On 29 November 2006 the Minister announced details of 54 major primary school building projects.  She promised they would be able to proceed to tender and construction stage and many of them would be built over the next 12 to 15 months.  That announcement was made on 29 November 2006, before the general election.  The election was held in May last year.  Two years after this announcement there is no sign of this school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1450">I hope the Minister of State has positive news.  Since the Minister of State has interrupted, I would have expected someone from the Department of Education and Science rather than the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to have replied to this debate.  It is an insult to me and to the House.  I saw the Minister leaving.  We have 22 Ministers of State so why can a Minister from the Department of Education and Science not answer my question?  This is the third time I have put it down for the Adjournment debate and I was hoping we would have an announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">There is a major problem with schools in Dublin but the west is being left behind because this school project was ready to go to tender.  The children have to vacate their building by June this year.  This is the third time they have moved.  The project is through the planning stage and we thought there would have been an statement a week or ten days ago, when the Minister was announcing the school programme.  It has not been announced and I want to know why.  When will the announcement be made and when will the project go to tender so that it can be built and the pupils will no longer be in rented accommodation?  As I have said, there have been three moves already.  I want to know what is going on in the Department of Education and Science.  It is ridiculous that these projects take so long to progress from stage to stage in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has served as a Minister.  Why have Ministers not taken control of the Department of Education and Science?  Why does it take so many stages and so long in Tullamore and elsewhere to build a school?  In 1995 the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was part of a Government in which I was a backbencher.  In that year there was a case involving school which was infested with rats.  Within a year work on the school was completed because the matter was pushed through every stage.  I would prefer to see 30 schools announced for one year and built within that timeframe or soon afterwards instead of this stage by stage system.  Teachers, pupils and parents are frustrated, as am I, because this is the third time I have tabled this matter on the Adjournment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1454">I apologise for interrupting the Deputy, but I want to clarify that 29 November 2006 was just a year and two months ago.  I shall endeavour to clarify where we have come from as regards this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of new premises for the school in question.  It is proposed to build a new ten-classroom school based on an existing design that was previously used in the provision of a school elsewhere.  Initially there were problems with the site acquisition and this delayed the progress of the project in applying for planning permission.  Planning permission and a fire certificate has now been obtained and the tender documentation is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Under the national development plan there is €4.5 billion assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  Just under €600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme in which the main focus is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  The progression of the school in question, as with all large-scale projects, will be considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">Last week, as the Deputy said, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, announced the details of the large-scale building projects to commence construction over the next number of months.  It is the Minister's intention to make a further announcement after Easter to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for delivery in September 2008 in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">I would like to give the assurance that the Minister and her Department are committed to providing suitable, high-quality accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy at the earliest possible date.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1461">I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 114 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">In December 2007, the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted Conclusions reaffirming the EU's commitment to long-term support for Afghanistan. The goal, in cooperation with the Afghan government, remains to extend stable and legitimate government and the rule of law to all parts of Afghanistan. It is of course also extremely important that the Afghan government make further meaningful efforts to address issues of concern such as drug production, tackling corruption, institutional reforms and the weakness of the rule of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">As regards the question of detainees, the Amnesty International report published in November 2007 considered the issue of the possible complicity of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in their torture or ill-treatment through transferring them from ISAF to Afghan authorities. Amnesty International concluded that ISAF states may be complicit in this treatment and that if they are to comply with their international legal obligations, they must temporarily suspend all transfer of detainees to the Afghan authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The report goes on to make the point that ‘ISAF, the Afghan government and relevant partners must urgently address the human rights concerns relating to the treatment of detainees. They should', it continues, ‘develop a comprehensive approach to reform the Afghan detention system in general and the National Directorate of Security (NDS) in particular'. At the same time, the report does not recommend that ISAF participants reduce their engagement in Afghanistan or that ISAF should take over the judicial functions of the Afghan state. ISAF's response to the report was that it has no evidence of mistreatment or torture of detainees who have been transferred by it to Afghan custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Ireland's strong view is that all countries who have contributed forces to the international effort in Afghanistan, be they part of ISAF or other military operations — including US forces who operate the Bagram base — would adhere to international human rights law and international humanitarian law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">There are seven members of the Permanent Defence Force currently serving in staff appointments at ISAF HQ in Kabul. Irish personnel have never been involved in any way in the transfer of detainees to the Afghan authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1469">I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The situation in Darfur remains dire, and the suffering of its people continues unabated, and the fracturing of the main rebel groups over the past year makes the pursuit of peace even more difficult.  The peace talks on Darfur which the UN and African Union are mediating represent a vital window of opportunity to bring about a lasting peace, and all of the parties bear a responsibility to use this opportunity to seek to resolve their grievances peacefully. So far, the process has been disappointingly slow. The UN and AU have sent emissaries to find and speak with the rebels who have been boycotting the talks, and it is hoped that formal talks will restart soon. The international community is supporting AU and UN efforts, and bilaterally Ireland has contributed €500,000 to the UN Trust Fund in support of the peace talks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Although peace will not come to Darfur until a political accommodation has been reached, UNAMID, the AU/UN hybrid force, has a role to play in re-establishing a secure environment and creating a breathing-space for the people of Darfur while negotiations continue. However, UNAMID, which took over from the African Union Mission in Sudan on 1 January 2008, is being hampered by the obstructive attitude of the Sudanese authorities to non-African participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of 28 January was briefed by UN Special Envoy Jan Eliasson on progress. We expressed our support for the pursuit and implementation of political solutions in Darfur and between north and south Sudan; condemned obstruction of, and a recent attack on, UNAMID; stressed the importance of unfettered humanitarian access; and called for full co-operation with the International Criminal Court. We also urged Sudan and Chad to refrain from incursions into each other's territory and support for rebel groups. In this regard, reports that Sudan is actively supporting the current insurgency in Chad are very disturbing</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">I welcome the fact that the GAERC has decided to keep the option of further sanctions on the table until we are sure that the Sudanese Government, as well as other parties, are co-operating fully with the peace process, with UNAMID, and with humanitarian actors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains very difficult, with the ongoing conflict continuing to limit humanitarian access to parts of North and West Darfur. The World Food Programme aims to provide food assistance to 5.6 million people in Sudan in 2008, including 3.7 million in Darfur. Since the start of 2006, Irish Government assistance to the people of Sudan, including Darfur, has amounted to almost €39 million. This includes funding of over €6 million since the start of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1476">Accession negotiations opened with Turkey in October 2005. Under the terms of the agreed negotiating framework, these negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">The negotiating framework addresses the European Union's expectations of Turkey with regard to advancing reforms in human rights and the protection of minorities. Turkey's progress in this regard is monitored closely by the European Commission, and is the subject of detailed reports to Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">In November 2007, the Commission published its annual Communication to the Council and European Parliament entitled "Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2007 — 2008." In relation to political reform in Turkey, the Commission reported limited progress during 2007. Areas where advances were noted included the ratification of international human rights instruments and implementation of European Court of Human Rights judgements. Further action taken to improve women's rights was also noted, as was a decrease in the reported number of cases of torture and ill-treatment. However, the Commission highlighted areas where further progress is required and emphasised, in particular, the need for significant reforms in relation to freedom of expression and the rights of non-Muslim religious communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">In December 2007, the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the Commission Communication and took note of its analysis and recommendations. The Council welcomed the resolution of the political and constitutional crisis in Turkey last year. The Council regretted that limited progress was achieved in political reform during 2007 but welcomed the Turkish Government's declared intention and renewed commitment to continue the reform process and address existing shortcomings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">The Council noted the process underway to revise the Turkish Constitution. This presents a key opportunity to fully enshrine European standards in Turkish constitutional law. Nevertheless, the Council stressed that this process should not delay long-awaited reforms. Particular attention was drawn to the need for Turkey to proceed without delay in the implementation of reforms in the key areas of freedom of expression and freedom of religion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">In addition, the Council stated that significant further efforts are also needed in other areas examined in the Commission Communication such as minority rights, judicial reform, the fight against corruption, and the strengthening of cultural rights, women's rights, children's rights, trade union rights and the civilian control of the military. As regards the East and Southeast of Turkey, areas that are home to a predominantly Kurdish population, the Council recalled the need to promptly develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that will guarantee the economic, social and cultural development of this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1484">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions, Ireland has taken a lead role in international efforts and has been working intensively with a number of like-minded countries to this end.  The Government will host a major Diplomatic Conference in Croke Park in May to negotiate a new instrument of international humanitarian law banning cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. It is intended that this will also provide for cooperation and assistance for survivors and affected communities, clearance of affected areas and destruction of stockpiles. The Dublin Diplomatic Conference will be a key step in the process, as it will see formal negotiation on the text of a Convention and I am hopeful of a substantial outcome. There is strong political momentum, with over 130 countries in attendance at the most recent meeting in Vienna last December and substantial representation envisaged at a further meeting in New Zealand later this month, the last discussion before the Dublin Conference. Good work is taking place to raise awareness of the issue at national and international level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">In further implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government, the Government has endorsed my plans to bring forward proposals for the establishment of a national committee on international humanitarian law which will, as its first task, begin work on preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect in domestic law to a new Convention and to enact a domestic ban on the use of cluster munitions. I believe, as does the Cluster Munition Coalition, a network of around 200 civil society organisations and the key civil society partner in the process preparing the Dublin Diplomatic Conference, that it makes sense to await the detail of the Convention before finalising legislation, as this will probably have to cover a range of issues not limited to a domestic ban which should not be prejudged at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Since 2005, Ireland has provided support of over €6.4 million for mine clearance, risk-education and rehabilitation of survivors and I remain open to increased levels of funding for such activities and in implementation of the new Convention.  With regard to the question of the investment of public funds, this would primarily be a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, and I have drawn his attention to the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">I welcome the attention given by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the issue of prohibiting cluster munitions nationally and internationally and supporting clearance, risk-education and rehabilitation of victims of explosive remnants of war, including mines and cluster munitions, and I look forward to working with the Committee to advance this important objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_1495">I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 222 and 228 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">The situation in Zimbabwe remains grave.  In addition to pervasive and very serious economic hardships, it is reported that political opponents of the Government and civil society activists continue to be beaten and tortured by police. The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, was one of several opposition activists arrested on 23 January 2008 in Harare following government attempts to ban an opposition march, though Mr. Tsvangirai was later released without charge. Such actions underline the pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and violence which exists towards those who seek change in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">Ireland and the EU believe that African leadership is the key to encouraging progress towards economic and political stability. We support the talks between the government and opposition in Zimbabwe which are being mediated by President Mbeki under a Southern African Development Community (SADC) mandate. I understand that media and security laws, as well as preparations for the March elections, are among the issues being discussed. The EU has no direct involvement in these talks though a representative of High Representative Solana did discuss their progress with AU, SADC and South African representatives in early December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">The Taoiseach discussed the progress of the SADC initiative with President Mbeki when they met in Pretoria on 15 January. The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, also attended the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December at which the EU's concerns regarding the current situation in Zimbabwe were clearly articulated by Chancellor Merkel and High Representative Solana on behalf of the Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">Implementation of any agreement reached will of course be crucial, and must bring about real policy change. The Zimbabwean people must have a chance to express their will without fear in the elections which have been announced for 29 March. Unfortunately, in the current environment we can have no confidence that Zimbabweans will have this chance. The appointment of an independent electoral commission, reform of the voter registration lists, the halting of political oppression and violence, free media access and the deployment of impartial election observers would be important steps towards ensuring that these elections are free and fair. There appears to be little prospect that such steps will be possible in the time available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">Ireland will continue to be active in relation to Zimbabwe, including condemning human rights abuses and urging political and economic reform. Our Embassy in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, and raises issues of concern with the Zimbabwean government at every available opportunity. Ireland has also supported raising the situation in Zimbabwe at the UN Human Rights Council. It is important to maintain pressure on the Zimbabwean Government to address the gravely irresponsible economic policies and appalling human rights situation in that country and, in that regard, last month Ireland fully supported the renewal for a further year of the EU Common Position on Zimbabwe, which provides for restrictive measures against the régime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">Irish Aid continues to provide support to alleviate the sufferings of the Zimbabwean people, amounting to over €17 million in 2006 and 2007, and already in 2008 a further €1.1 million has been disbursed. Our contribution is channelled through UN agencies which are active in Zimbabwe such as the World Food Programme and UNICEF, as well as local and international NGOs, and Irish missionaries. Ireland stands ready to respond appropriately to any positive change in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">The Government attributes the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States. I have also made it a personal priority as Minister, and will continue to do so. The passage of the agreed Motion by the Dáil on 7 November sent an important and timely message of solidarity from all parties of the House to our undocumented community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative bilateral options.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">I emphasised our interest in and support for a bilateral solution for our undocumented citizens in a series of meetings with key US Administration and Congressional figures during a visit to Washington last October. Since the all-party Motion was passed, the Taoiseach had a detailed telephone call with Senator Edward Kennedy on 7 December, in which he again reiterated the Government's strong support for a bilateral solution. At a meeting with the US Ambassador later the same month, I forcefully made the same point. Likewise, our Ambassador and his Embassy colleagues in Washington are in ongoing discussions with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures, including Senators Kennedy and Schumer, on possible ways forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">Achieving progress on immigration at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 11 million undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">Despite these considerable political difficulties, the Government is determined to make every effort to succeed. The Taoiseach will again be pursuing our case very actively at the highest level on his visit to the U.S. over the St. Patrick's Day period, as will the Ambassador and his colleagues on an ongoing basis on the ground in Washington.</p>

            <p eId="para_1513">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 146 and 223 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, as authorised by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), was formally launched by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January. Ireland is expected to be the second largest contributor of troops to the mission, which aims to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">The nomination of Lieutenant General Pat Nash for the position of Operation Commander of EUFOR was approved by Dáil Éireann on 9 October. The Dáil gave its approval for Irish participation in the mission on 28 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">As part of the advance Command Group of the Force Headquarters, a total of eight Irish soldiers deployed last month to N'Djamena and Abéché in Chad, as part of a reconnaissance party in advance of the main body of the EU's Initial Entry Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">A further contingent of 54 members of the Defence Forces was due to travel last week. This deployment was postponed by the Operation Commander due to a sudden escalation in fighting between rebels and Government forces in Chad, including in the capital N'Djamena, and the consequent unavailability of the airport. The Defence Forces are maintaining regular contact with the eight Irish soldiers currently in Chad. A further contingent of 54 members of the Defence Forces was due to travel last week. This deployment was postponed by the Operation Commander due to a sudden escalation in fighting between rebels and Government forces in Chad, including in the capital N'Djamena, and the consequent unavailability of the airport. The Defence Forces are maintaining regular contact with the eight Irish soldiers currently in Chad. All are safe and well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">The European Union has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a political settlement of the conflict. The Union also emphasised its commitment to the achievement of the objectives of EUFOR and to the continuation of the deployment when circumstances permit. The United Nations Security Council similarly demanded an end to the violence and recalled its commitment to the sovereignty and political independence of Chad. It also reaffirmed its full support for EUFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">Latest reports indicate that the situation in Chad has stabilised. As my colleague the Minister for Defence has indicated, the next deployment of Irish troops is therefore expected to take place within 8 -10 days, contingent upon the prevailing operational circumstances and the availability of the airport in N'Djamena. The Defence Forces Headquarters in Dublin, the Operational HQ in Paris and the Force HQ in Abéché are continuing to monitor the situation on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">The mission is planned to reach full operational capability by mid-May, by which stage the Irish contribution will be in the region of 400 personnel, primarily drawn from the Western Brigade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">While mindful of the need to minimise risk, the Government remains strongly committed to the humanitarian objectives of EUFOR. The current incursion by rebel forces is a matter for the Chadian authorities and does not fall within the remit of the EU mission, which, as stated above, is focused on the protection of refugees and internal displaced persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">The Government does not at present have plans for any diplomatic delegations to countries in the region. I would however recall my visit to Sudan and Chad last November, when I had the opportunity to visit the refugee camps in Eastern Chad where EUFOR will facilitate the provision of humanitarian relief. The Government also decided in December to request the Government of Chad to accept the accreditation of a non-resident Ambassador, based in Abuja, to facilitate communications and foster relations between Ireland and Chad. Diplomatic contacts with other countries in the region are maintained through regular diplomatic channels.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1524">Audits of Ireland's overseas development aid are undertaken on the basis of a three-year rolling audit work plan which is overseen by the Department's Evaluation and Audit Unit. At the start of each year an annual operational plan is agreed which comprises a range of audit activities including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">Work carried out directly by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit and by Internal Auditors based at Missions in Programme Countries;</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">Work carried out by internationally recognised audit firms that is commissioned by Irish Aid;</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Joint donor funded audits of specific programmes;</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">Audit reports obtained from other partner organisations such as those carried out by UN funds and programmes and non-governmental organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The main objective of Irish Aid's audit programme is to gain assurance that funds granted are used for the purposes intended. As systems of control in developing countries are often weak, Irish Aid works closely with partner governments and other organisations to improve their financial and accounting systems. This work includes strengthening audit institutions and standards in line with international best practice, with capacity building where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">The Evaluation and Audit Unit conducts a series of audit visits annually to Irish Aid's Programme Countries.   During 2006 and 2007, the Unit carried out eight such visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">The Missions in Irish Aid's Programme Countries are themselves audited annually by internationally recognised audit firms. Further audit assurance is provided by Mission-based Internal Auditors who carry out audits of partner organisations that are in receipt of Irish Aid funding and review Missions' internal controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">Where issues of concern arise they are reported to Senior Management. Management responses are provided in reply to each audit, and a process has been established for follow up on the implementation of audit recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">In addition to these robust internal systems the Department has an independent Audit Committee which reports to the Secretary General. It provides an independent appraisal of the Department's audit and evaluation arrangements through regular interaction with the Evaluation and Audit Unit and Senior Management. The Committee meets regularly with the Secretary General and annually with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work; the 2006 version is available on the Department's website at <i>http://www.dfa.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1540">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, 142, 145 and 235 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">Following its signature in Lisbon on 13 December 2007, Member States are expected to ratify the Reform Treaty by 1 January 2009.  The Attorney General has advised that the legal effects of the Reform Treaty require amendment of the Constitution to enable ratification by Ireland. The timing of the referendum is currently under consideration by the Government. A number of points will have to be taken into consideration, including the timing of the legislation's passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the desired duration of the referendum campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">Under the Referendum Act, in the case of a constitutional referendum, the Referendum Commission can be established no earlier than the date on which the Referendum Bill is initiated in Dáil Éireann. It is the Government's intention to properly resource the Commission and to give it sufficient time to carry out its tasks. Preparatory work is already underway to ensure that the Commission is in a position to undertake its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">In this respect, the Government Supplies Agency recently published a notice inviting tenders for the supply of bilingual booklets by the Referendum Commission to inform the electorate about the Reform Treaty. While the work of the Commission is entirely a matter for the Commission, it is expected that between 2.4 and 2.5 million booklets will be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">The drafting work on the Referendum Bill is nearing completion and work on a White Paper on the Reform Treaty is ongoing. It is the aim of the Government to publish the White Paper in good time to inform the debate in the Oireachtas and in the referendum campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">Voter turnout is an issue for any referendum and there can be no room for complacency. The Nice Treaty referendum taught us a valuable lesson in this regard. A priority for the Government therefore is to inform the public about the Treaty and explain the issues at stake. A detailed guide to the Reform Treaty is expected to be published later this month. This will form part of the Government's information campaign, following both the publication of an information pamphlet in December and the setting up of a dedicated Reform Treaty website which, among other things, contains the full text of the Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">Additionally, the National Forum on Europe will have an important role to play in promoting greater awareness of, and debate on, the Reform Treaty.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1565">I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 131, 151, 154 and 226 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">Ireland, together with our EU partners, continues to have concerns about human rights issues in Pakistan, including the situation of the Ahmadis. Promoting religious tolerance remains a key EU objective in Pakistan and we have urged the government there to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions. Regular human rights demarches are carried out by the EU at official level with the Pakistani authorities. The situation of minorities was among the issues raised at the most recent demarche, which took place in June 2007. The EU expressed its continued concerns over abuses of the blasphemy laws, which are often used to harass members of minority communities as well as Muslims. An additional current concern is the Ahmadi community's claim that they are being discriminated against in the current electoral process, as a result of the Government requirement that they register on a separate voter list, and their consequent decision to boycott the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">As regards the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, President McAleese, the Taoiseach and I all issued statements immediately after this tragic event on 27 December. As I noted in my statement, the killing of Benazir Bhutto was an attack on democracy, as she, her party and the country prepared for parliamentary elections. I would reiterate my call upon the Pakistani authorities, and all those with particular influence upon them, to do their utmost to ensure that Pakistan continues on its path back to democracy. Equally, as the EU Presidency made clear in its statement on 27 December, all sides should refrain from violence and civil unrest and pursue the path of national reconciliation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">As regards the forthcoming elections in Pakistan, President Musharraf has repeatedly insisted that these will be ‘free, fair, transparent and peaceful'. In order to ensure and assess that this is the case, 1,759 observers have been accredited to monitor the Elections, of which 307 are international observers. The largest international team will be the EU Election Observation Mission — to which Ireland has contributed 6 observers. Two important Pakistani civil society groups will also be playing an active role — the Free and Fair Election Network and the Pakistan Coalition of Free and Fair Elections. The EU's Election Observation Mission has been playing an active role on the ground, including providing their observations to the Pakistan government and elections Commission. The UN is not sending an observation team but has provided technical support for the preparation of the elections, primarily through UNDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">In the overall context, the lifting on 15 December of the state of emergency has resulted in some easing of restrictions on pre-elections preparations. As a result, many aspects of the logistical preparations for the elections have been progressing well. A computerised final electoral roll was made available on the internet on 8 January, the recruitment of polling personnel has been finalised, details of the numbers of registered voters and lists of polling stations, polling booths and poling personnel for each constituency have been published, the printing of ballot papers has been completed and on schedule, and plans are underway to roll out tamper-proof, transparent perspex ballot-boxes that will be used in the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Concerns remain, however, about some of the arrangements, as well as the potential for rigging the elections. There is still no official list of candidates and a number of appeals regarding the eligibility of some candidates are awaiting decision by the Supreme Court. The requirement for voters to present new computerised National Identity Cards may disenfranchise some voters, particularly the disadvantaged and those in remoter areas. The compilation and consolidation of results by returning officers will be a particular focus for election monitors. A number of media restrictions remain in place, and I would call for these to be lifted immediately. A further important step would be to end the ongoing arrests and harassment of political opponents, and to release all political prisoners, including human rights defenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The EU has consistently urged President Musharraf and the Pakistani Government to do all possible to ensure that these elections are indeed fully free and fair, as has been promised. Strong messages on these lines were conveyed by the EU Presidency, and other European leaders, during Musharraf‘s recent visit to Brussels and some European capitals.  Ireland, with our EU partners, will continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan in the lead up to and throughout the upcoming elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1573">Ireland has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad, as well as the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast and the North-South Ministerial Council Joint Secretariat in Armagh. While the opening of new Embassies abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken having regard to clear priorities and available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">The White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September 2006, designated Malawi as Ireland's ninth programme country.

            <p eId="para_1575">The successful trade mission, led by the Taoiseach in January 2007, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates underlined the potential value to Ireland of having a second resident Embassy in the Gulf region. Accordingly, and in order to take advantage of this potential, the Government in March 2007 agreed to my recommendation that an Embassy be established in the United Arab Emirates. The timing of the establishment of this new Embassy in Abu Dhabi is under consideration.  Apart from the United Arab Emirates, there are no plans at present to establish any other new Embassies.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1577">The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in the year 2000 as part of the commitments undertaken by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit, represent a framework for international economic and social development up to the year 2015.  The latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date, broken down by goal and by region. Overall, there has been good progress on some targets, with more intensive effort required on others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">On the positive side, the indications are that, if current trends continue, we are on target to reach the MDG on poverty reduction for the world as a whole. Progress has also been made globally in relation to reducing child mortality and increasing school enrolment rates.   However, while there has been progress towards the goals globally since 2000, largely due to advances in China and other Asian countries, Africa is lagging behind on most indicators. This is attributed to a combination of institutional weakness, civil and international conflict, and funding shortfalls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">In recognition of these problems Ireland continues to focus around 85 percent of its bilateral country assistance on sub-Saharan Africa and Irish Aid will continue to expand its assistance to the region as our aid programme grows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">Failure to reach the MDGs in Africa would be an indictment of the developed world. It is in the interests of each and every country to ensure that the Millennium Goals are reached as the instability caused by global poverty and HIV/AIDS is a threat to all humankind and not just to the countries affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">In reaction to the geographical disparities highlighted in the latest review, the UN Secretary General convened an MDG Africa Steering Group last September. His initiative has brought together high level representatives of the African Union, European Union, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, IMF and World Bank, who will meet regularly to examine how to strengthen Africa's efforts to meet the Goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">A further initiative aimed at measuring progress towards the MDGs has been taken by the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who has proposed that a Heads of State/Government meeting take place at the UN in September 2008 to revitalise the pledges made in 2000 and provide the impetus for more intensive efforts in the period up to 2015. The Prime Minister wrote to the Taoiseach about his proposal and the Taoiseach has replied indicating Ireland's strong support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">Ireland participates fully in efforts to achieve the MDGs. As set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the Millennium Development Goals are the overarching framework for our overseas aid programme. By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is also seen as being at the forefront of their implementation internationally.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1585">Following the failure in December of the talks led by the Contact Group Troika, there is broad acceptance within the international community that no agreement on Kosovo's status is possible between Belgrade and Pristina. The possibility of progress at the UN is also blocked, with deadlock at the Security Council over the proposal by the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, for a settlement based on internationally supervised independence for Kosovo. In these circumstances, it is widely expected that Kosovo will shortly declare its independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">At the European Council of 14 December last, EU leaders discussed the Report from the Contact Group Troika on the conclusion and failure of the Kosovo status talks. The European Council thanked the Troika for its efforts, and regretted that the parties had not been able to make use of this opportunity to find agreement on a common way forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">In the light of the failure of the Troika process, the European Council considered the position to be adopted by the EU. It underlined the need to move forward towards a Kosovo settlement, which is required for regional stability. There was strong emphasis on the importance of a unified EU approach, and for the EU to make clear its willingness to take the lead internationally in helping to manage and resolve this European problem, including by means of the planned ESDP rule of law mission, and a contribution to an international civilian office, as part of the future international presence in Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">We recognise that difficult choices will now need to be made which deal with the reality of the situation on the ground. The status issue presents a challenge which we and our EU partners must be prepared to meet in a unified way. We welcome the statements of the December European Council, underlining the EU's readiness to meet this challenge. Ireland will play its part.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">On the basis of positive advice from the Attorney–General confirming the continuation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 until it is rescinded by the Security Council, Ireland will be able to maintain our enhanced presence in KFOR. We intend to contribute members of the Garda to the ESDP Mission and also to support the future economic development of Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">Ireland has strongly and consistently supported the Ahtisaari proposal, which provides for internationally supervised independence for Kosovo with strong guarantees for the rights of Serbs and other minorities. We believe that this proposal provides the most practical and realistic solution for the future status of Kosovo, and expect that any declaration of independence by Kosovo will be accompanied by a commitment to implement its provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The Government has not yet taken a decision on the question of national recognition of Kosovo independence, and I believe that it would be not be helpful for me to speculate on this matter in advance of any declaration of independence. As indicated, strenuous efforts will be made to agree a common EU approach in response to any such declaration.</p>

            <p eId="para_1594">In addition, Subhead G of the Vote for Foreign Affairs provides for 2008 a sum of €891,000 in respect of Cultural Relations with other countries.

The projects which will be supported during 2008 are proposed throughout the year so details are not available at this stage.

            <p eId="para_1597">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 147 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">I remain very concerned at the situation in Somalia. The country has been without an effective government since 1991, and despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) in December 2006, the situation has worsened in recent months. The first troops from an African Union-mandated peace support force (AMISOM) were deployed to Mogadishu in March 2007 but, as it stands, and with less than a quarter of the planned 8,000 troops on the ground, AMISOM has not been able to bring any important measure of stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">The position has deteriorated since October 2007, when there was an upsurge in violence in Mogadishu triggered by the killings of several Ethiopian soldiers. Since then, there has been intense fighting in Mogadishu between Ethiopian and TFG forces on the one hand, and clan militias and Islamists on the other hand. The appointment of a new Prime Minister, Nur Haasan Hussein, in November 2007 has however brought some hope of a fresh political approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">The fighting in Mogadishu since October has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the capital, adding to the humanitarian crisis, particularly in and around Mogadishu. In total, approximately one million people have been displaced since the start of 2007, while up to one and a half million need humanitarian aid. The precarious environment in which humanitarian personnel in Somalia operate has been highlighted by the recent killing of three humanitarian workers there. I am also deeply concerned by reports of an Irish national being held hostage, along with a number of others, on a ship hijacked earlier this week by pirates off the Somali coast. Access for humanitarian personnel and supplies has also suffered as established supply routes through Kenya have been affected by the ongoing crisis in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">The Special Representative of the UN Secretary General (UNSRSG), Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, briefed the UN Security Council in December 2007 on his contacts with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Hussein in an effort to resolve the ongoing crisis by peaceful means. The UN Secretary General has made it clear to the Security Council that due to the prevailing political and security situation, the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to Somalia is not a realistic option for the time being.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">My EU colleagues and I discussed the situation in Somalia at the General Affairs and External Affairs Council in December 2007. We agreed that a political solution will be the key to ending the suffering of the Somali people. Ireland has regularly highlighted the priority which must be given to ensuring unobstructed humanitarian access and has urged that the EU use its influence in this regard. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided over €14 million in humanitarian assistance to the Somali people, and we stand ready to provide further assistance, as required.</p>

            <p eId="para_1604">Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf of 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country. For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005. The Commission issued its recommendations in April 2007 concerning the limits of this claimed area. The Government has accepted these recommendations and work is now in hand to designate in domestic law the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as continental shelf belonging to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay. This was the subject of a joint submission made together with the UK, France and Spain in May 2006. It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory. This submission remains under consideration by the subcommission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it. The four states most recently met with the subcommission last month and it was agreed that further discussions will take place when it resumes its work in New York in April. It is hoped that the subcommission will be in a position to formulate its draft recommendations during 2008. These recommendations must in turn be approved by the full Commission. The question of division of the area between the four states concerned will be considered after the recommendations have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Færoe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims and these discussions are continuing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1610">As the Deputy will be aware, there is a large number of international agreements within the UN framework, covering a very wide range of subjects and falling within the functional responsibility of a number of Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">Two international agreements within the UN framework for which my Department holds lead responsibility have been signed but not yet ratified by Ireland. These agreements are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">1.The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, signed 18 April 1961, and</p>

            <p eId="para_1614">Ratification of these agreements is linked to the wider question of the making of a declaration by Ireland accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. The full implications of making such a declaration and the question of what, if any, conditions or reservations should attach to it, are complex matters which require careful study, including with the Attorney General.</p>

            <p eId="para_1618">I refer the Deputies to previous replies to similar questions concerning the United Nations Convention against Corruption, most recently on 27th November 2007. The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in October 2003 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature, in December 2003. The Convention entered into force on 14 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has arranged for his officials to undertake a detailed examination of the text of the Convention to ascertain what, if any, changes to the domestic criminal and civil law and to administrative practice will be required in order for Ireland to ratify this Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">Following extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it has been concluded that Ireland largely fulfils the criminal justice requirements of the Convention either through existing anti-corruption statutes or via legislation that is in progress such as the forthcoming Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">A number of other issues in the civil and administrative area will also have to be addressed in advance of Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be pursuing these matters with the relevant Departments and Agencies.  Ireland is fully committed to ratifying this Convention and to its implementation internationally through our support for the EU common position on the Conference of States Parties (COSP) which took place in Bali last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">Ireland is supportive of the EU policy favouring the establishment of a strong and effective review mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. Ireland also supports the EU common position on asset recovery through the identification and promotion of effective methods of facilitating the return of proceeds of corruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">The Irish delegation in Bali made a full contribution to the Conference. Ireland was represented by officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs. An officer from the CAB also attended the Conference.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         the details of the proposed stabilisation and association agreement to be signed by the EU after it takes over control of Kosovo from the UN and Serbia and the exploratory talks that may have been held with the Serbian authorities regarding Kosovo’s future and independence; if preliminary discussions regarding Serbia joining the EU in the future have been held; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_491">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1625">The European Union's Stabilisation and Association Process for the countries of South-Eastern Europe aims to strengthen political and economic stability in the region.  The process involves the negotiation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) with each of the countries concerned.  The principal objective of these Agreements is to bring the countries closer to EU standards and principles.  The Agreements confirm the EU's readiness to integrate them into Europe's political and economic mainstream.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">Where Serbia is concerned, signature of the proposed SAA remains contingent on an assessment by the EU Council of Ministers that Serbia has cooperated fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  Pending such a positive assessment, the Council agreed at its meeting on 28 January to propose an interim political agreement on cooperation between the EU and Serbia.  This decision reflects the importance which the EU attaches to Serbia's European future, and comes at a time when relations between the EU and Serbia are tested by our differences over the Kosovo final status process.  The issues of the SAA and Kosovo were most recently discussed between the EU and Serbia at a Troika meeting with Foreign Minister Jeremic in Brussels on 28 January.  I had the opportunity to hear the Serbian perspective at first hand during my visit to Belgrade last November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">It is important to note, however, that the issue of signature of the SAA with Serbia is not directly linked to the specific question of Kosovo's final status, but is in its own right an important step towards the realisation of Serbia's European perspective.  A clause in the draft Agreement excludes Kosovo from the scope of the SAA, reflecting the fact that Kosovo has been under UN administration since 1999, in accordance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and that its final status remains to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">With regard to the question of Serbia joining the European Union at a future date, the December 2007 European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies within the European Union.  It considered that a stable and prosperous Serbia fully integrated into the family of European nations is important for the stability of the region.  In this regard, it encouraged Serbia to meet the necessary conditions to allow its Stabilisation and Association Agreement rapidly to be signed and, in the light of Serbia's considerable institutional capacity, and recalling its conclusions of December 2006, it reiterated its confidence that progress on the road towards the EU, including candidate status, can be accelerated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">With the conclusion in failure last December of four months of talks led by the International Contact Group Troika, there is broad agreement within the international community that no agreement on Kosovo's final status is possible between Belgrade and Pristina.  The possibility of progress at the UN is also blocked, with deadlock at the Security Council over the proposal by the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, for a settlement based on internationally supervised independence for Kosovo.  In these circumstances, it is widely expected that Kosovo will shortly declare its independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">The status issue presents a challenge which we and our EU partners must be prepared to meet in a unified way.  We welcome the statements of the December European Council, which underlined the EU's readiness to meet this challenge.  Ireland will play its part.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">On the basis of positive advice from the Attorney–General confirming the continuation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 until it is rescinded by the Security Council, Ireland will be able to maintain our enhanced presence in KFOR.  We also intend to contribute members of the Garda to the planned ESDP rule of law mission, which was endorsed by the European Council last December and is seen as a key element of the international civilian presence in a post-status Kosovo, and to support the future economic development of Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">The Government has not yet taken a decision on the question of national recognition of Kosovo independence, and I believe that it would be not be helpful for me to speculate on this matter in advance of any declaration of independence.  As indicated, strenuous efforts will be made to agree a common EU approach to this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1634">As the Deputy will be aware, C.J. Hambro was a distinguished Norwegian political leader in the earlier part of the last century.  Mr. Hambro was a defender of the rights of small nations in an era when these rights were far from being guaranteed.  His belief in the rights of small nations led him to defend the cause of Irish independence and gave rise to his admiration for Éamon de Valera.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">As I indicated in my reply to PQ No. 68 of 27 November 2007, I was made aware of an initiative in July 2007 regarding a proposed commemoration of Mr. Hambro in Muckross House.  While I would be willing to lend my support to such a proposal in view of Mr. Hambro's distinguished background, the issue of a commemorative memorial in Muckross House is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was in contact with the interested party last Summer to indicate that they are not in a position to accede to such a request, but did advise of alternative possibilities for commemorating Mr. Hambro.</p>

            <p eId="para_1637">The Antarctic Treaty opened for signature on 1 December, 1959 in Washington DC and came into force in 1961.  The stated aim of the Treaty is to ensure "in the interests of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord."</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">While the Treaty has been in operation since 1961, only 46 or fewer than one quarter of UN Member States, are States Parties.  Many of those who have chosen not to accede have argued that the Antarctic should be declared part of the common heritage of mankind and thus be treated in a manner analogous to Outer Space or the International Sea Bed Area and therefore beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.  Some have called for a UN agreement to which all Member States would subscribe as the best means to ensure full accountability for actions undertaken in, affecting and concerning Antarctica.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">While Ireland has traditionally been sympathetic to this view, we are aware of the immense difficulties which would arise in seeking to negotiate a new Treaty.  We have also carefully noted the UN General Assembly Resolutions of 2002 and 2005 which affirmed that the management and use of the Antarctica should be conducted in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international co-operation for the benefit of mankind as a whole.  The Resolutions also welcomed the practice whereby the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties regularly provide the UN Secretary General with information on their consultative meetings and their activities in Antarctica.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">As I indicated in my reply to PQ No. 226 of 21 November 2007, it has been decided in all the circumstances to re-examine the issue.  Officials in my Department have since then begun a study of the detailed issues involved in accession and will shortly be in a position to initiate broader interdepartmental consultation.</p>

The most recent UN reports indicate that approximately 20,000 households or 95,000 people have moved to resettlement centres as a result of flooding in Mozambique.  The National Institute for Disaster Management has requested the World Food Programme (WFP) and cooperating partners to continue food distributions to affected populations throughout the month of February.  Presently the WFP has 845 metric tonnes of food stocks positioned near the flood-affected areas.  Ireland is a major donor to the WFP and provided almost €26 million of funding to it in 2007.</p>

Government Departments are represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee by senior level officials who are actively engaging in the work. Two Sub Groups of the Committee have been established, one to look at developing a more coherent policy in our relationships with Multilateral Organisations and the second focusing on making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service in our development aid programme.  The Committee will report annually to the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlining its activities and making recommendations as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">My colleague Dermot Ahern T.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are deeply conscious of the need to keep members of the Oireachtas informed of and engaged with the work of the overseas aid programme.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has played a key role in examining and debating a wide range of development related issues.  A number of visits to Programme countries have been made by the Chair and members of the Committee.  I welcome the Committee's engagement with the aid programme and hope that it will increase in importance as the programme expands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">A major review of the management of the Irish Aid programme is currently underway.  The aim of the review is to ensure that the systems, structures, procedures and staffing of Irish Aid can deliver a high quality aid programme as funding expands towards reaching the target of 0.7% of GNP target by 2012, as committed to by the Taoiseach.  It is hoped that the review will be completed this Spring.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         the position regarding the situation in Sri Lanka where despite a recent cease-fire having been brokered, there are continuing reports of deaths and attacks on civilians; the assistance the EU has offered in this regard in possible peace-keeping issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1664">Recent months have seen a further alarming escalation of violence in Sri Lanka, including increasing military operations, suicide attacks and assassinations, with significant numbers of civilian casualties.  I utterly condemn the senseless and callous series of terrorist bombings over the last few days in Sri Lanka that have killed some thirty people and injured scores of others.  It is vital that both the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka recognise that a sustainable solution to the problems Sri Lanka faces cannot be achieved by military means and that they need to immediately resume meaningful negotiations for a peaceful future for the people of Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">In this context, and as I said in a statement on 4 January, I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Government of Sri Lanka to terminate the 2002 ceasefire agreement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  I believe that this withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement can have only negative repercussions for Sri Lanka and its people, including for the already serious humanitarian and human rights situation in that country.  It is the responsibility of all sides of the conflict to seek to meaningfully and peacefully address the differences between them for the sake of all the people of Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">It is also deeply unfortunate that the Nordic Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), whose mandate ended on 16 January following the end of the ceasefire agreement, has now had to withdraw from Sri Lanka.  Norway had played an important and significant role as facilitator to the Ceasefire Agreement and the peace negotiations which followed it.  On the more positive side, however, Norway has indicated that it will continue its contacts with both sides, so that it might again be able to facilitate talks if the sides agree to return to the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The situation in Sri Lanka is regularly discussed with EU partners, and the EU continues to play an active role as one of the four Co-Chairs of the 2003 Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka.  The EU has called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to come forward with a substantive devolution offer around which negotiations might restart, as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">One possible route towards negotiations might be the proposals on the devolution of power to the provinces of the All-Party Representatives Committee (APRC), submitted to President Rajapakse on 23 January.  The Committee was established by President Rajapakse in 2006 to seek to forge a consensus among the political parties in Sri Lanka on a possible political solution to the conflict.  I understand that a final, consensus document is being finalised by the APRC and is due to be submitted to the President in the near future.  While the Government of Sri Lanka have stated that these recommendations will be implemented in full, it would be important that any final political solution be achieved in an inclusive manner, with the involvement of parties to the conflict, including the LTTE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">The EU, and Ireland nationally, remain ready to support a meaningful peace process in Sri Lanka, and to provide assistance in any manner acceptable to both sides of the conflict, and in support of the Norwegian facilitator.</p>

            <p eId="para_1671">The so-called charity, Zoe's Ark, was originally established in the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami.  In April 2007 it announced, via its website, a campaign to evacuate 10,000 orphans from Darfur.  Its website stated the charity wanted to place Darfuri children under five in foster care with French families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">The French Foreign Ministry issued a warning about the group in August 2007, stating there was no guarantee that the children involved were orphans without family support, and casting doubt on the project's legality.  However, it is thought that up to 300 families in Europe volunteered to act as hosts, each handing over several thousand euro in exchange for the opportunity to foster a child.  On 25 October, six members of the charity, along with three French journalists, seven Spanish flight crew and a Belgian national were detained in Abeché, Chad, as they attempted to put 103 children on board a charter flight to France.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">All six members of the charity and the three journalists were charged with attempted child abduction and fraud, while the others were charged as accomplices.  The charity claimed that all the children, aged between one and ten, were orphans from Darfur.  However, investigations by UNICEF and other humanitarian organisations established that few, if any of the children were orphans, and most if not all were from the Chadian border region rather than from Darfur itself.  It also emerged that some of the children were bandaged so as to appear injured.  The charity insisted it was working in good faith at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Authorities in France, including PM Fillon, condemned the operation.  President Déby of Chad accused the group of "trafficking children under cover of humanitarian assistance."  When in Chad shortly afterwards, I was informed by the Prime Minister and other interlocutors of the seriousness with which the issue was viewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">Following discussions in November 2007 between President Sarkozy and President Déby in Chad, all of those in custody, with the exception of the six members of the charity, were released by Chadian authorities.  In December 2007 the six members were sentenced to eight years hard labour after a trial in N'Djamena, and also fined $9 million.  Under the terms of a 1976 judicial accord between France and Chad, the members of the charity were transferred back to France on 28 December 2007 where they will serve the remainder of their sentence, which was confirmed by a French court last week as eight years imprisonment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1696">Ireland provides development assistance to Uganda directly and also through NGOs, missionaries and other international partner organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">In 2006 Ireland provided over €32 million in direct assistance.  Additional funding of over €9.5 million was made available through other organisations including the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, UNHCR, Oxfam, World Vision and Irish NGOs such as Concern, Christian Aid, Goal, and Trócaire.  A detailed breakdown of these figures is available in the Irish Aid 2006 Annual Report.  I have arranged for a copy of the report to be sent to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">In 2007, direct assistance amounted to over €34 million, and indirect assistance to some €8.7 million.  The final figures are being prepared and a comprehensive breakdown of the figures for 2007 will be included in the 2007 Annual Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">Ireland's development aid programme in Uganda is aligned with the Government of Uganda's national poverty reduction plan.  It focuses on those areas which will have the greatest impact on the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community, such as education, health, HIV/AIDs and good governance.  Irish Aid assistance has contributed to the considerable progress that has been made in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">For instance, in education, by 2006 the net enrolment rate at primary level had reached over 91%, increasing from 85% in 2002.  With Ireland's assistance the provision of Anti Retro Virals (ARVs) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS was established in over 200 accredited health facilities during 2006 and over 2000 health workers were trained in comprehensive HIV care.  By 2006, the governance sector was strengthened by the introduction of accountability and anti-corruption measures such as the rollout of public expenditure reform initiatives and the enhanced capacity of the Office of the Auditor General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Support channelled through the Poverty Action Fund facilitated the provision of services at local level in key social sectors such as water, sanitation and agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The Irish Aid programme has in place monitoring and auditing frameworks to ensure that our assistance is effective and that it is implemented for the benefit of those for whom it is intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The rigorous accounting and audit controls help to ensure a transparent, effective and high quality programme.  Programmes are audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department.  Programmes are also evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended, in particular in respect of outcomes and value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">The UN World Summit held in September 2005 agreed a package of UN reforms which, while not as complete as might have been hoped, represented an important advance.  I was honoured to have contributed to the Summit Outcome in my role as one of the five Envoys appointed by former Secretary-General Annan to support his recommendations for change aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the UN.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">Key issues addressed since the Summit have included the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, both of which were priorities for Ireland.  Discussions are ongoing on the important issues of management reform and reform of the Security Council.  Together with its partners in the EU, Ireland has actively supported the continuing efforts to bring about improvements in the management of the UN, aimed at making the Organisation and its Secretariat more responsive and effective in fulfilling its purposes and in meeting the needs of the international community.  However, despite progress in a number of areas, there remains much more to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">As regards reform of the Security Council, Ireland's view is that a more representative, efficient and transparent Security Council is an essential aspect of reforming the UN to meet the many global challenges which we face.  We welcome and support the current efforts of the President of the General Assembly to reinvigorate the debate and we look forward to participating actively in future discussions of the issue.  At the same time, the difficulty of achieving agreement is very apparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">Discussion of the reform of the UN development architecture is centred on the recommendations of the UN High Level Panel on System-wide Coherence, a group appointed by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in February, 2006, and composed of figures such as the EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel, the then British Chancellor Gordon Brown, and the Prime Ministers of Pakistan, Mozambique and Norway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The Panel report makes a series of recommendations designed to improve the UN's internal coherence and ability to deliver development assistance.  They centre on the development of a unified UN presence at country level, with one leader, one budget, a single programme agreed with the host Government, and, where appropriate, one office.  This process is described as Delivering as One.  The report also recommended the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to become the authoritative environment pillar of the UN, and the establishment of a single UN entity to address gender equality and women's empowerment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">Since the publication of the Panel report in late 2006, pilot programmes have been established in eight countries, including in three Irish Aid priority countries Vietnam, Tanzania and Mozambique.  Irish Embassies in these countries actively participate in the implementation and oversight of the reform process at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">In recognition of Ireland's pro-active role in relation to UN reform, the Irish Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ambassador Paul Kavanagh, was recently appointed by the President of the UN General Assembly to co-chair, with his Tanzanian colleague, the process of consideration and implementation of the Panel recommendations within the General Assembly.  His mandate will run until September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1716">I emphasised that Ireland and its EU partners are gravely concerned at the ongoing deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe.

            <p eId="para_1717">Ireland's policy is clear; we wish to see a change in policies in Zimbabwe to tackle the suffering of the people there and ensure full respect for their rights and dignity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1731">On 6 December 2006, as part of Budget 2007, I announced that it was planned to introduce changes to the VRT system to take greater account of environmental issues, and in particular Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Programme for Government of June 2007 re-affirmed the commitment to introduce measures to further weight VRT in favour of cars with lower emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">A public consultation process was carried out by my Department. The consultation process evidenced broad support for a reorientation and rebalancing of VRT. I announced in my Budget Statement on 5 December 2007, my plans to introduce a revised VRT system, based on CO2 emissions from mid 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">Changing the VRT system to make it take greater account of CO2 emissions levels is a significant change. It is therefore desirable that members of the public be given reasonable notice of any changes being introduced. In addition, the motor industry indicated that it needed at least six months prior notice of any substantial change being made to the system, in the light of the advance ordering arrangements for new cars in the industry.  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners' technical and administrative processes required amendment in order to facilitate the revised VRT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Having examined the matter, it was considered therefore, as I announced in reply to Parliamentary Questions 148 to 150 on 3 October 2007, that any proposed VRT changes should be effective from around mid-2008.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 218 of 30 January 2008, if he will clarify if a person is liable for inheritance tax on a family home, if the home in question was originally passed down from father to son, and thereafter passed onto another sibling; and if the total value of all inheritance and gifts received over a period of time is calculated together.

            <p eId="para_1746">For the purposes of both Gift and Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance and the person who received the gift or inheritance determines the maximum tax-free threshold — known as the "Group threshold" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  The details of these thresholds were set out in my earlier response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">When calculating whether a beneficiary has received benefits in excess of his or her Group tax-free threshold, any other gifts and inheritances received by that beneficiary   since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group are also taken into account. If the total value of all gifts and inheritances received since this date is above the relevant Group threshold, then a 20% rate of gift/inheritance tax applies on the excess over the threshold figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">Therefore, when the family home was passed down from father to son, the son would not be liable to Inheritance Tax on the inheritance he received from his father if the market value of the family home, when added to the value of any other assets inherited from his father or gifts received from him, were below the Group A tax-free threshold for the year in question in which the son received the inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">If, subsequently, the home was then passed on by the son to one of his siblings by way of inheritance or gift, the sibling would be entitled to the Group B tax-free threshold, which applies to gifts and inheritances between siblings, in respect of that separate inheritance received by the sibling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">The inheritance taken by the son from his father and the inheritance later taken by the sibling from their brother are two separate inheritances and are taxed separately, with each beneficiary being entitled to their own Group tax-free threshold depending on their relationship to the individual disponer from whom they are receiving their inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">Apart from the tax-free Group thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code exempts certain gifts and inheritances completely from tax and also contains relieving provisions.  As it appears that the Deputy has a specific case in mind, she may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners who will be in a position to advise on the tax implications.</p>

            <p eId="para_1756">The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2 May 2002 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable.  In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and that I, as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) are rateable unless expressly exempted under schedule 4.  Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act. Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the rateability of child care facilities.  Accordingly, purpose-built childcare buildings designed and used to make profit are rateable as commercial buildings. Houses which have been adapted for commercial use in a dedicated area (i.e. converted garage for exclusive use as childcare) are rateable, for that specific area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The Valuation Act, 2001 maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities — including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates.  It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any individual ratepayer who has concerns about the valuation of their property or of any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of €250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p>

            <p eId="para_2168">Customs have initiated a confidential reporting regime under the Drugswatch programme whereby aerodrome operators and other relevant parties can report suspicious activity. Under this programme Customs also offer advice regarding minimising the risk of the facilities being used by persons for the purpose of smuggling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In relation to the number of flights arriving from EU and non-EU destinations, while the Customs control regime involves the monitoring all such arrivals, the definitive source of this information is the licensing authority, the IAA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">In relation to the Customs control regime in place at such aerodromes, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that this is risk-based and is carried out by mobile Customs Enforcement Officers. Attendance by these Officers is selective, targeted and predominantly unannounced and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators. Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Flights with origins and destinations with a high risk rating would attract particular interest. These attendances cover the full range of flight times and are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increases at these aerodromes/airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than for anti-smuggling checks. In fact some of the smaller aerodromes  have no international flights. Revenue's approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">Revenue is satisfied that having regard to the context set out above, the risk based approach at these airports remains valid and their operations are on par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 175 and 182 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">At a meeting between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) under Mr Bill Shipsey SC on 5 December 2007, a process was proposed to the IPU to (i) address their immediate concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies and (ii) to provide a basis upon which discussions on a new substantive contract could commence. The IPU was not prepared to accept this proposal from the HSE and, accordingly, no further discussions have taken place under Mr Shipsey's auspices since then. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement, the HSE has offered a draft interim contract to pharmacists to address their main concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies. I am informed that the HSE intends to implement the deferred revised wholesaler arrangements from 1st March 2008. The Executive also recently commenced discussions with the IPU and other parties on the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract. The details of the draft interim contract, and the HSE's other intentions in this regard, were set out in a letter to individual community pharmacists on 2nd January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">In the light of the legal position previously outlined in the House, and after further consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Departments and the HSE on the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists in compliance with competition law, my Department is working to develop appropriate arrangements for the development of contracts and for the setting of the fees payable in respect of contracts with private sector undertakings for the provision of health services on behalf of the HSE.  These arrangements may include the establishment of an independent body which would consider the nature of the service to be provided and all other relevant factors in each case and make recommendations to the Government in relation to the fees it considers appropriate. The composition of such a body, its terms of reference and the timescale for its work are amongst the matters to be considered in this regard. In line with the legal advice received, the HSE may enter into discussions with community pharmacists on the non-fee aspects of their contract, with a view to developing a new substantive pharmacy contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_2219">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the specific matters raised by the Deputies.

            <p eId="para_2234">Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the Dental Surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s).  Children who have attended national school retain eligibility to dental treatment up to their 16th birthday.</p>

            <p eId="para_2258">The co-location initiative aims to make available approximately 1,000 public acute hospital beds for public patients, beds that are currently being used by private patients.  In accordance with the competitive dialogue procurement process which is being used, the Board of the HSE approved in July last successful bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at the following six hospital sites:</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">Waterford Regional Hospital</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">Cork University Hospital</p>

            <p eId="para_2264">St James's Hospital</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">Since then the hospitals and the bidders have been working towards finalising the Project Agreements.  It is expected that the Project Agreements for Beaumont, Cork and Limerick Hospitals will be signed very soon. It is also anticipated that the signing of the Project Agreements for the other three sites will be concluded shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process. A tender in relation to Connolly Hospital is under consideration and it is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">Under the Project Agreements agreed with the HSE, the land on which the Hospitals will be built by the successful bidders will be under a 65-year lease from the State at full market value. The intention is that no land will be sold to the successful bidders. This efficient utilization of public resources means that the State will receive an income for land over the 65 year period.  The commercial value of each site has been determined by independent assessors.  The provision of 1,000 beds will result in no direct capital costs to the Exchequer. Capital costs will be met by the successful bidders.</p>

            <p eId="para_2282">The Cork Swansea Ferry service was suspended in 2007.  I can appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in the region in response to this development.</p>

            <p eId="para_2294">Motor insurance companies in Ireland insure vehicle drivers rather than vehicles.  This enables them to calculate the risks associated with a specific driver and thereby price the insurance premium accordingly.</p>

Using this system, drivers with apparent higher risks pay a higher premium than other drivers.  This also enables a specific driver to establish a no-claims status over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">There would be a possibility of increased premiums for most drivers if the system were changed to allow open driving for any vehicle. Under the present system, there has been a decline of 40% in motor insurance premiums since April 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_2301">The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">There are currently 54 licences issued to private bus operators authorising bus passenger services within the Dublin area.  These include commuter type services, Airport services, LUAS feeder services, tours, night link, and school services.  The details of all current licences issued to private operators are available to view on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">All licences issued in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932 have standard conditions associated with them and compliance with those conditions is the responsibility of the service operator in each instance.  A condition of all licences includes the requirement whereby the service must be in operation in its entirety within 4 months from the date of issue of the licence.  In exceptional cases, the four month deadline may be extended subject to the prior written approval of my Department.  It is also a condition of all licences that the licensee adheres to the approved timetable as listed on the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">My Department is not aware of any licences being held by private operators that are not being operated save in circumstances where the period of introduction has not yet expired or where the operator has applied to my Department and has been granted an extension to that period in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">All licences with the exception of Occasional licences that are issued for a particular event must be renewed each year.  In order for the Department to renew a licence, the licensee must provide evidence to the effect that the service in being operated in accordance with the conditions attached to the licence including the authorised timetable.  Evidence to support this must be in the form of a current published timetable, website timetable or letter from An Garda Síochána confirming that the service being operated is in accordance with the licence.  Where evidence of operation is not available, the Department informs the operator that the application for renewal cannot be processed and the licence is considered lapsed.  In addition to checks made at renewal stage, Departmental officers carry out periodic monitoring spot checks throughout the year to ensure compliance by operators to their licensed services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2313">I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 to 220, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">In view of the current international focus on the Iranian nuclear issue, and on developments in Iraq, I believe it is important that we do not lose sight of the human rights situation in Iran, on which we have very serious concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">After a period in which gradual progress was evident in the overall human rights situation, the past few years have witnessed a serious and sustained erosion of human rights protections in Iran. Moderate and reformist political voices have been suppressed, and freedom of expression has been severely curtailed by actions against media outlets and individual journalists.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">Against this background of reassertion of State control, a wide range of other human rights issues has also shown a marked deterioration.  These include the increased use of the death penalty, including executions of minors and, in some isolated cases, recourse to the barbaric practice of execution by stoning.  Iran executed some three hundred people in 2007, and has reportedly already executed twenty-eight in 2008, including thirteen people on 2 January.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">There has been a notable increase in intolerance of expression of identity by national minorities, and active harassment of minority communities, including the Baha'i community.  Trade unions and women's groups have been suppressed and there has been a sustained campaign against NGOs and human rights defenders. Indeed groups and individuals in Iran are now being targeted by the authorities because they have been in contact with western Embassies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">I have been seriously concerned by these developments, and I raised them in my meeting with Foreign Minister Mottaki in New York in October 2007.  The Government and our EU partners make frequent representations to the Iranian authorities about specific cases and issues, and about the broader principles of human rights.  On the specific issue of executions, we have raised the principle of the death penalty, its increasing use, the cruel methods employed, and the execution of child offenders. Ireland participates actively in discussions within the EU on how best to advance these issues.  In recent years we have co-sponsored a Resolution at the UN General Assembly on the human rights situation in Iran, along with Canada and others.  We did so again in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">Regrettably, Iran has shown little interest in tackling these issues.  A formal Human Rights Dialogue between the EU and Iran is now effectively in abeyance.  The last meeting was held under the Irish EU Presidency in 2004, and it seems clear that Iran is not now willing to engage in the dialogue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">There is little to suggest that ending trade with Iran would be likely to influence this situation. Iran has already learned to live with almost thirty years of US sanctions and relative isolation.  Much of its economy is now offshore or in the black market, and the domestic economy is dominated by oil and gas exports, for which global demand continues to increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">The Government and our EU partners will continue to use every opportunity to draw attention to, and where possible to uphold, the fundamental rights of the Iranian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">My Department has received no representations from Iranians living here about activities by the Embassy of Iran.</p>

            <p eId="para_2324">The reduction of poverty, hunger and conflict in Africa is one of the most important tasks of the international community in the 21st century.  Conflict has many causes and many manifestations, but poverty, inequality and exclusion have proved to be the most fertile breeding grounds for violence and ethnic hatred.  Most wars occur in poor countries, and the causes and effect of conflict are exacerbated by poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">Through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security.  Addressing Africa's needs, especially the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable, necessitates comprehensive action by the international community and by African governments.  In order to measure development progress and to set benchmarks, the UN set the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by world leaders in 2000.  While the MDGs are undoubtedly ambitious, they can be reached if the affected countries themselves, the donor community, the UN and EU work together to ensure that peace and security, poverty reduction, good governance and sustainable development are the cornerstones of all our efforts in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">African leadership and responsibility are crucial, and the African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and the international community generally.  Since 2004, the EU has supported the development of African-led peacekeeping in Darfur and elsewhere through its African Peace Facility.  Peace and security, governance and developments were among the themes which European leaders discussed with their African counterparts at the EU-Africa Summit in December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">Africa is at the heart of Ireland's programme of official development assistance.  Irish Aid provides emergency humanitarian aid, funding for recovery, and long-term development assistance to many African countries either directly, or through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and Non-Governmental Organisations.  In the context of an increasing aid budget as we approach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, these interventions are being further strengthened through enhanced support at the global and country levels.  The launch of the Hunger Task Force and the establishment of a Conflict Resolution Unit in my Department are clear and practical manifestations of our resolve to do more in these areas which directly affect the lives of millions throughout the developing world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">Ireland's contribution to promoting security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to UN and EU peace-support missions, including UNMEE in Ethiopia and Eritrea from 2001-2003, UNMIL in Liberia from 2003-2007, and the current EUFOR mission in Chad and the Central African Republic.  In addition, we have provided support to the UN's Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The challenges facing Africa are enormous.  But there is some encouraging news.  Many African economies are growing.  The work of the International Criminal Court marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, though full co-operation with the ICC remains essential on the part of all who have signed the Rome Statute.  While there are exceptions such as Somalia, Zimbabwe and others, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than for many years.  There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, Uganda and southern Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">I believe that Ireland's comprehensive and inclusive approach to the challenges of poverty, conflict and food insecurity stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people living in Africa.</p>

        [4182/08]

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_550">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2332">The generally peaceful and orderly conduct of the 2006 Presidential and Parliamentary elections — the first democratic elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in more than forty years — was a tribute to the strong desire of the Congolese people for an end to conflict and a return to democracy. Since then, noticeable progress had been made in many parts of the country. The new political institutions, including the parliament, are now beginning to take root, although major challenges remain — not least of which will be the holding of successful and peaceful local elections later this year — if the transition process is to be successfully completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">However, the renewed conflict in eastern DRC during 2007, and the major humanitarian emergency which has resulted, continue to pose a serious threat to the transition process. The continued existence of armed militias preying on the population and ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions have been elements in the heightened tensions. The EU has expressed particular concern over the systematic sexual violence which has become routine in this conflict, and which is spreading to the civilian population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">As regards the deeply worrying situation in the Kivu provinces , I warmly welcome the agreement reached at the Goma Peace Conference last month. The agreement includes a ceasefire, an agreement to release child captives and a commitment to continue the process of re-training ex-combatants and integrating them into the national army. This agreement provides an opportunity, if the will is there, to end the conflict in these provinces and build lasting peace and democracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">The DRC is one of four country situations where the International Criminal Court (ICC) has currently decided to act, and two individuals from DRC have been arrested and will stand trial in The Hague. The work of the ICC represents a step towards ending impunity for the many appalling crimes which have been committed in DRC in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Ultimately, an end to the conflict throughout the DRC will require the creation of stability and the establishment of the rule of law throughout the country. I fully support the work of the United Nations in the DRC, especially the contribution that the UN's peace-keeping mission, MONUC, has made to increased stability. Security sector reform, demobilisation and disarmament, ending impunity, and establishing an effective, fair and transparent system of justice are also urgently required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">The European Union, including Ireland, is fully committed to helping the Congolese government to tackle these problems. On the ground, two European missions are assisting, respectively, in police reform and with guidance on army integration and other security issues. Establishing stability and justice will be a slow process, but Ireland and the EU are committed to providing assistance in the long term.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_2339">Global warming is a serious concern to everyone. We are all increasingly aware of the threat this now poses to humanity. The Government is strongly committed to fulfilling its international obligations to reduce the level of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">However, global warming cannot be solved by one country alone — it requires the commitment of all nations in the world. Rain forests play a very important role in preventing global warming. They help to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. They also release oxygen into the environment. In doing so, they provide benefits not just to the countries where they are located, but to all nations and peoples.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">Most of the world's rain forest is located in the developing countries, including Nigeria. There are reports of significant industrial logging taking place in Cross River State, the location of the last remaining rain forests in Nigeria. Rain forests once covered about 30% of the earth's land surface but this figure has now fallen to about 6%. Preserving the remaining rain forest presents a serious challenge, but it cannot be left to individual countries alone. It requires a concerted international effort. One way to encourage poorer countries to avoid further deforestation is to reward those that protect rain forests through the provision of economic incentives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">Ireland will continue to play its part in supporting international efforts to preserve the rain forests and the rights of those who live there. The Irish Aid Environmental Policy commits Ireland to addressing global environment problems through our engagement with bodies such as the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. It also commits Ireland to supporting the efforts of partner governments and civil society at country level and to work closely with other donors in ensuring a coordinated response to environmental challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">Ireland, through Irish Aid, supports a number of organisations involved in climate change. This includes the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) which has launched a strategic initiative on climate change. The CGIAR is a network of 15 institutions dedicated to pro poor agricultural research and the transfer of the results as rapidly as possible to those working on the ground. This initiative, which Ireland supports, assigns climate change a central place in their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">Irish Aid also supports, in cooperation with the Department of the Environment, the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change which manages two funds, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund. Both of these are assisting countries to adapt to the impact of climate change. Irish Aid also supports a number of key international institutions including the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) all of which are active in policy and advocacy on climate change including the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2346">The European Union's extensive relations with Ukraine are conducted within the framework of a number of agreements, the most significant of which are the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the EU-Ukraine Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement entered into force in 1998. It highlights respect for fundamental values as an essential element of the EU-Ukraine relationship, and provides a framework for cooperation across a wide range of areas including political dialogue, trade and investment, economic and legislative cooperation and cultural and scientific cooperation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">EU-Ukraine relations developed further with the adoption in 2005 of the EU-Ukraine Action Plan, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The on-going implementation of this Action Plan helps to fulfil the provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">Sectoral agreements are also in force between the EU and Ukraine, including in the fields of trade in textile products, aviation, energy, trade in certain steel products and scientific and technical cooperation. An EU Border Assistance Mission ( EUBAM), launched in November 2005 at the joint request of the Presidents of Ukraine and Moldova, works with both countries to enhance the management of their shared border. The Mission has been a success and was recently extended until November 2009. Since April 2005, Ukraine has also been eligible to align itself with EU statements under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and has chosen to do so in the great majority of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">Negotiations are ongoing between the EU and Ukraine on a new Enhanced Agreement to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. It is intended that the new Agreement will provide for strengthened political dialogue and cooperation in the fields of foreign and security policy, economic cooperation, energy, transport, and justice, freedom and security. Once Ukraine completes its accession to the World Trade Organisation, it is expected that negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement, which is intended to be a cornerstone of the new Enhanced Agreement, will get underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_2352">As has been made clear on previous occasions, it is not the policy of the Government to draw up a ‘league table' of countries deemed guilty of the worst human rights abuses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">Human rights remain central to our foreign policy. Active participation in the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council. At these bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">The Government will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_554">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_2357">As outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the Government's commitment to tackling HIV and AIDS and other diseases of poverty will remain a top priority for our aid programme. We are committed to developing programmes that address the key causes of illness and ill health among the poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthening health systems in the poorest countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">Following the commitment made by the Taoiseach in his speech to the United Nations in 2005, funding for HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases is now reaching over €100 million per year. This is an enormous achievement. Ireland now leads the way within the European Union in terms of the proportion of its overseas development assistance allocated to HIV and other diseases of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">Our assistance is directed at programmes at country, regional and international levels and is ensuring that increasing numbers of people are accessing quality HIV and AIDS and other health services. The target countries for most of Ireland's bilateral assistance — Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi — continue to bear the highest disease burden in the world. Our approach is saving lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">The United Nations and the European Union play a critical role in addressing the main diseases of poverty, including HIV and AIDS through setting global policy, guidance on best practice, providing specialist technical assistance and funding specific interventions aimed at tackling these diseases. We will continue to fund and work closely with a range of UN Funds and Programmes as well as the European Commission and Member States to advocate for a sustained and resourced global response to health and HIV and AIDS and strengthened leadership at all levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">This year Ireland assumes a leadership role in steering UN reform.  The theme ‘Delivering as One' provides the opportunity to build a more effective inter-UN agency response to HIV and AIDS. Ireland will work closely with the Joint UN Programme on AIDS, UNAIDS, in this regard. Sitting on the board of UNAIDS this year provides Ireland with the opportunity not only to advocate for increased effectiveness and efficiency within the UN system, but also to advance some of its key priorities including the need for a stronger focus on children and women, and ensuring that health and HIV and AIDS are addressed in the context of humanitarian and emergency situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">In June of this year the United Nations General Assembly will debate progress being made to achieve Universal Access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Ireland has already submitted its report on how it is addressing this global pandemic and will send a high level delegation to advocate for increased political commitment, additional resources and consensus on addressing key obstacles to better health for those most vulnerable and marginalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">Ireland has prioritised the needs of children in its work on HIV and AIDS. It is the only country to target 20% of its increased funding to interventions that will benefit children. In recognition of Ireland's leadership in this area, it has been requested to host the fourth Global Partners Forum on Children affected by HIV and AIDS. Working in cooperation with UNICEF and scheduled for October, this forum will bring together high level decision makers from both developed and developing countries to debate the best approaches to ensuring the protection of children living in a world with HIV and AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">Ireland's leadership on HIV and AIDS was recognised last year during the visit of the Executive Director of UNAIDS to Dublin. He said that Ireland has taken on the kind of leadership role that will help bring us closer to a world without AIDS. This year Ireland will continue to work with the international community and its programme countries in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases, strengthened leadership at all levels, and improved coordination of resources for effective disease prevention and control.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2366">In previous statements and in responses to Parliamentary Questions, I have made clear my own, and the Government's very deep concern about the situation in Burma. Following the horrific events that occurred in that country in September, I undertook a number of initiatives to highlight the extent of the repression taking place and the importance of the mission of the UN and the Secretary General's Special Envoy, Dr Ibrahim Gambari. These included direct bilateral approaches to leaders of neighbouring countries of Burma, seeking their support to end the bloodshed and encourage the initiation of dialogue; pressing for, and securing, European Council Conclusions on the issue and political agreement to step up sanctions against the Burmese regime; a meeting with Burma's ‘Prime Minister in exile, who is also a first cousin of Aung Sang Suu Kyi; and support for the work of Burma Action Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">More than four months have passed since the crackdown against monks and peaceful protestors took place and I remain deeply concerned by the situation in Burma, and the lack of progress in creating a meaningful political dialogue process. I have noted with disappointment the comments by Aung San Suu Kyi on 29 January that the talks she has had with the government's liaison minister have offered very little of substance, but are intended rather to give the appearance of serious negotiations. Ms Suu Kyi has also made clear her concerns that the dialogue process does not include representatives of the various ethnic minorities and that there is no fixed deadline for an outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2368">It is only through an inclusive and time-bound process that a sustainable and peaceful future for Burma will be achieved. It is imperative that the regime now engage meaningfully in dialogue that produces substantive results. The international community must take more concrete steps to seek to encourage this. The dialogue process cannot be replaced by the work of the government's Constitutional Drafting Committee, from which the opposition has been excluded, and which is expected to produce a draft in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2369">The Burmese government continues to arrest political opponents and to prosecute those involved in organising the protests last year. I am deeply concerned by the decision to charge U Gambira, the leader of the All-Burmese Monks Alliance who is currently being held in Insein prison, for his role in the protests in September last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">I am also deeply concerned by and condemn the Burmese government's decision to charge Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi and eight other activists who were organisers from the major student protests in Burma in 1988, and who have been detained without charge since August 2007, for their involvement in last year's demonstrations over commodity prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">I deeply regret the fact that the Burmese government has refused to facilitate an early further visit by the UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Burma/Myanmar, Dr Ibrahim Gambari. He should be able to visit whenever he wishes, and without conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">Dr Gambari was in India last week, and will travel to China later this month, to explore how they can further support the Secretary-General's good offices mission. Both Dr Gambari and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon have stressed the importance of tangible action by the Burmese regime, and have rightly made clear that the patience of the international community is running out. Dr Gambari briefed the UN Security Council prior to his departure for India, following which the Council expressed its regret at the slow rate of progress towards the objectives it set out last October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">Dr Gambari met with EU High Representative Javier Solana in Brussels on 25 January, as well as with senior Commission officials. These talks included discussion of contacts with countries in the region, the Commission's funding for Gambari's Office and other aspects of its activities in relation to Burma, including humanitarian assistance, and the development of civil society and the media. EU Special Envoy for Burma/Myanmar Piero Fassino has also recently visited countries in the region, calling on governments to unite in putting pressure on Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">It is expected that EU Foreign Ministers will again review the situation in Burma at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 18 February, ahead of the renewal of the EU's restrictive measures on Burma in April. The EU continues to look at the possibility of further measures should the Burmese régime continue blatantly to ignore the will of the international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">Ireland, with our EU partners, will also continue to push for the Burmese régime to cooperate fully with the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma/Myanmar, Sergio Pinheiro, in implementing the recommendations in his report presented to the UN Human Rights Council on 11 December, and in line with the Council's resolution asking Special Rapporteur Pinheiro to undertake a follow-up mission to examine in greater detail the human rights violations occurring in Burma.</p>

            <p eId="para_2377">There are two main international instruments which address the problem of the debt burden in the developing world, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">The HIPC Initiative, which was launched in 1996 and strengthened and enhanced in 1999, seeks to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but does not entail cancellation. Progress on the implementation of HIPC is slow but positive and to date debt reduction packages have been approved for 32 countries, 26 of them in Africa, providing US$46 billion in debt-service relief. Nine additional countries are eligible for relief under HIPC but have not yet reached their decision points. Ireland has contributed €30m towards the cost of implementing HIPC.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July 2006, provides for 100% relief on eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund to many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the World. Most of these countries are in Africa. The initiative is intended to help them advance toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are focused on halving poverty by 2015 by freeing up resources that would otherwise have been used to service their debt burden.</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">All countries that reach the completion point under HIPC, and those with per capita income below US$380 and outstanding debt to the three institutions at end-2004, are eligible for the MDRI. The total cost of implementing MDRI is estimated at US$47.9 billion and to date 25 countries have benefited from relief at a cost of approximately $37.6 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">Ireland's share of the total cost of the MDRI debt relief to be provided by the World Bank is €58.6m. As a gesture of support and to underline our strong commitment to 100% debt relief for the poorest countries, this amount has already been paid over in full.</p>

Kerry has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing for foreign direct investment.  However, over recent years it has proved challenging to maintain and attract overseas manufacturing companies into the County as much of this investment globally is going to low cost destinations such as Eastern and Central Europe and China.  As a result of this locational shift in global manufacturing, Kerry has seen a number of closures within the multinational sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">IDA Ireland's strategy for Kerry has been to promote the county as part of an integrated region with access to the county population base of 139,616 as well as the expanded population of both the Mid West and South West Regions with a combined population of 935,039.  Based on the strengths of the region IDA is particularly targeting the ICT (including software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  IDA Ireland will continue to promote the region and the advantages of locating in Kerry, which include a young skilled population, the presence of the Institute of Technology in Tralee and the availability of first class business parks and a regional airport.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the county.</p>

            <p eId="para_2429">Details regarding IDA Ireland supported companies and jobs in County Cork from January 2002 to December 2007 are outlined in the following table.  The number of client companies has declined from 137 in 2002 to 134 in 2007.  The total number of closures was 36.  This table also outlines the number of jobs lost in the county broken down by year.  The recognition under the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020 of the importance of Cork as a major gateway location and Mallow as a hub, will assist IDA Ireland in promoting the region for inward investment.  It will also assist in the development of the necessary critical mass needed in terms of population, skills and infrastructure. IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote Cork and the advantages of locating in Cork, which include a young skilled population, the presence of both a University and an Institute of Technology, the availability of first class business parks, good infrastructure and an international airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">Over the past 10 years, direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork City and County has grown from 12,449 in 1997 to 20,114 in 2007.  There are currently 134 IDA supported enterprises in Cork City and County. Recent announcements in Cork include Blizzard, SolarWinds and Apex.  These projects will significantly add to the value and depth of the overseas industry in Cork.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage the expansion of their operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2474">I am aware of the recent increase in the price of a range of foods in the last number of months.  Whilst the December 2007 Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office shows that although the annual rate of inflation fell to 4.7% in December down from 5.0% in November, the price of food and non alcoholic beverages increased by 6.3% in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">Rising food prices are being experienced across the world due mainly to a number of factors including climatic, economic and demand reasons.  A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation has identified that the rapid expansion of the global biofuel industry is causing fundamental changes to agricultural markets and is likely to keep the prices of agricultural commodities high over the next decade.  A rise in input and transportation costs consequent on increased fuel and energy prices has also contributed to the increase in biofuel production.  Adverse weather conditions which have seen a two-year drought over large parts of Australia and an unusually wet summer over much of Western Europe in 2007 together with a drought in South-Eastern Europe has had consequent effects on food yields. This has coincided with an increased demand for meat and dairy products in significant developing markets such as China and India.  Notwithstanding the global rise in food prices, Government policy in relation to the food prices, remains focused on ensuring that there is a competitive market in groceries as ultimately it is competitive markets that will benefit consumers and the economy as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_2673">I am aware that Benzylpiperazine (BZP), a synthetic psychotropic substance, is for sale in certain shops and I have serious concerns over its safety.  I understand that some users of such substances have reported a range of adverse reactions such as vomiting, headache, palpitations, poor appetite, stomach pains/nausea, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, confusion, irritability and tremors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2674">The issue of BZP has been discussed on a number of occasions at meetings of the Inter Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG), which I chair.  These discussions were in the context of EU consideration of the substance. In this context, it should be noted that Ireland was among the countries that, in March last year, requested the European Council to conduct a risk assessment procedure on the substance, which is not banned at present in most European counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2675">The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction completed its investigation in June 2007 and reported back to the Commission recommending tighter controls.  Arising from this, the Commission decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control, in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  The Council will decide over the coming months if BZP is to be placed under such control.  If the decision is to place the substance under control, Member States would then be required to introduce controls in line with national laws no later than one year after the Council's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2676">The Deputy will appreciate that the implementation of any such decision rests with the Department of Health &amp; Children, which has responsibility for keeping the list of scheduled substances under review.</p>

With almost €600 million to be spent this year on school building projects we need to manage the projects on a rolling basis throughout the year in order to deliver the best outcome for our investment. It is my intention to make a further announcement after Easter to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2781">The new NDP 2007-2013 will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings.

Projects undertaken in 2007 alone will deliver over 1,500 projects which will ultimately deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas. My Department will target funding, as appropriate, in order to ensure that additional school accommodation is provided in developing areas within the earliest possible timeframes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model have been introduced to ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible.

            <p eId="para_2789">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I announced on 1 February the first tranche of projects to proceed to construction in 2008.  My announcement included details of the 18 large scale building projects approved for construction and a further 30 new primary schools in rapidly developing areas, being planned to be in place by next September.  My Department will be in contact with the school authorities of the 18 large scale projects over the next number of days to advise on the most appropriate preparation schedule applicable on each project.  This is the first tranche of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009.  The immediate task is to ensure that the projects in this first phase are advanced to construction immediately to ensure delivery of the maximum number of school places in order to meet the increased school population.  With almost €600million to be spent this year on school building projects we need to manage the projects on a rolling basis throughout the year in order to deliver the best outcome for our investment.  It is my intention to make a further announcement after Easter to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.</p>

Grant aid shall not be paid to a candidate who already holds a qualification and wishes to pursue a further qualification at the same level irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  An assessing authority has discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness.  Grants shall not be paid to candidates who already hold a Level 8 (Honours Bachelor Degree qualification or equivalent qualification) and are pursuing a second such qualification.  However, notwithstanding this condition the following candidates may be deemed eligible for grant aid: (i) candidates who already hold a Level 6 qualification (Higher Certificate or National Certificate) or Level 7 (Ordinary Bachelor Degree or National Diploma) and are progressing to a Level 8 (Honours Bachelor Degree) course, without necessarily having received an exemption from the normal duration of the course; and (ii) candidates who have satisfactorily completed two years of a Level 7 (Ordinary Bachelor Degree or National Diploma) course, and gain admission through exemption, to year two of a Level 8 (Honours Bachelor Degree) course.

            <p eId="para_2827">The person concerned arrived in the State on 25 August 2006 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 6 November 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. In addition, he was notified that he was eligible to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, S.I. No. 518 of 2006, which came into force on 10 October 2006. The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application will be considered in due course. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">The Deputy can be assured that all applications for Subsidiary Protection and for permission to remain in the State are considered on their individual merits. Among the issues to be considered, as I have referred to earlier, is that of refoulement. This is essence means that before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signs a Deportation Order, he must satisfy himself that the person who is the subject of that Order would not, in the opinion of the Minister, have their life or liberty put at risk by their being returned to their country of origin for reasons of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2833">As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2839">Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2840">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_2997">I am advised by the Garda authorities that dedicated radio systems are operated to provide beat and mobile patrols with communications to their district, division or area control centres as appropriate.  I am also advised that official mobile phones are made available to all Garda managers and other nominated personnel as operational needs demand.  In addition, specially configured mobile phones are available to all Garda personnel for contact with the Garda Information Service Centre for the creation and updating of incidents on PULSE. This obviates the need for Gardaí to return to their stations to report incidents thereby freeing up more Gardaí for operational duties.  These phones can also be used to contact the members station, district and divisional headquarters and the 999 system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2998">There is specific exemption for members of An Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Act 2006 on the use of a mobile phone while driving in respect of Gardaí who are acting in the course of their official duties.</p>

These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.</p>

            <p eId="para_3015">An Garda Síochána continue to focus their enforcement activities on the main causes of deaths and serious injury on the roads — drunk driving, speeding and the non-wearing of safety belts. The Garda Policing Plan for 2008 aims to increase in the course of the year by 10% detections for driving while intoxicated, speeding and also road transport offences. The continuing increase in the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps, which will reach its planned level of 1,200 by the end of this year, is enabling a continuing increase in enforcement activity to take place. Along with the increase in its strength, a corresponding allocation of vehicles and other resources is being made to the Traffic Corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">With regard to combating speeding, detailed analysis by An Garda Síochána of collision data is under way to identify locations and times where the greatest tendency for speed related collisions occur.  Speed enforcement will be prioritised on a risk assessment basis on such locations and at such times.  The public will continue to be made aware of roads which have been identified as having a propensity for speed related collisions, including through the Garda website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">The Gardaí are planning to replace their existing vehicle-based mobile speed detection systems this year. They are also developing proposals to introduce in a range of Garda vehicles an automatic number plate recognition capability, which in addition to assisting in detecting suspect and untaxed vehicles will have a speed detection capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3018">With regard to outsourcing the provision and operation of safety cameras to a service provider, following the issue of a Request for Tender, tenders were received and evaluated. Issues have arisen because costs involved would now be substantially higher than had been estimated for the Government previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_3019">I intend to bring proposals before my colleagues in Government shortly taking into account issues of value for money and the commitment, as is evidenced by the enhanced activity by An Garda Síochána which I have outlined, to reduce speeding on our roads.</p>

            <p eId="para_3037">I am providing some €999.2 million in general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund to local authorities for 2008.  These grants are my contribution to local authorities to meet the difference between the cost to them of providing an acceptable level of day to day services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants. The amount being made available for general purpose grants this year represents an increase of some €51.5 million, or 5.4%, over the amount provided for 2007 and continues the trend of providing additional general purpose funding to local authorities.</p>

In the circumstances, while no useful purpose would be served by meeting the proposed delegation in the context of the 2008 general purpose grant allocations,  I will take an opportunity to meet with the Council as part of a programme of visits to local authorities during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3043">I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 311 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">Minimum standards for private rented accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and €250 for each day of a continuing offence. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">The number of legal actions initiated on a county/city basis for breaches of the regulations, as reported by local authorities, is published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website at www.environ.ie. Data for 2007 are not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">A report published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007 points out that landlords' responsiveness to notices of non-compliance issued by local authorities has ensured that the need to prosecute is relatively low. The report also concludes that the low volume of cases taken each year suggests that most examples of non-compliance are on a relatively minor scale.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_3049">I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 314 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">A reply to the letter dated 25 January 2007 issued from the Office of my predecessor on 22 February 2007. The reply set out the position in regard to wastewater treatment systems under the national Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3051">Part H of the Building Regulations (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) sets out the requirements for the treatment of effluent from wastewater systems. The relevant Technical Guidance Document H (TGD-H) provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H and calls up, inter alia, Irish Standard Recommendation SR:6 of 1991 — Recommendations for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from a Single Dwelling House, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">TGD-H also acknowledges that wastewater treatment systems other than septic tanks may be used. Such systems are accepted as satisfactory provided it can be shown that they are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are used. Part D of the Building Regulations (Materials and Workmanship) specifies alternative ways of proving compliance, including compliance with appropriate product standards or being subject to certification by an appropriate national certification body.</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">The Irish Agreement Board (IAB) is the national and European recognised body for certifying new building products or systems for which national standards do not exist. The IAB is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">A new European Standard (EN 12566-3) for small wastewater treatments plants has been introduced and is now in the transitional phase of implementation. The need for new systems to comply with this standard has been brought to the attention of Local Authorities by Departmental Circular Letters BC16/2006 and BC 2/2008, dated 8 November 2006 and 28 January 2008 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3055">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently finalising a revised edition of their Manual on Wastewater Treatment Systems serving Single Houses, in consultation with all interested parties. It is understood that the EPA Manual will refer to relevant European Standards and that the NSAI propose to withdraw SR6: 1991, in favour of the proposed new edition of the EPA Manual, when available.  My Department plans to amend TGD-H to call up the EPA Manual and to consider any related issues at that time.</p>
