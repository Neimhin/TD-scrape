          <p eId="para_1">Tá an stailc atá tógtha ag na heolaithe leighis, agus na himpleachtaí ar na seirbhísí sláinte dá bharr, ag tarlú mar gheall nár dhéileáil an Rialtas leis na fadhbanna ag croílár an aighnis. Tá cothromaíocht i gcúrsaí pá, deiseanna traenála agus coinníollacha oibre fíorthábhachtach do sheirbhísí sláinte nua-aimseartha. Níl aon oibrí ag iarraidh a bheith amuigh ar stailc. Is an rogha dheireanach atá ann. Medical scientists are on the picket lines today, and will be again tomorrow, fighting for fair pay and decent career and progression opportunities. We are seeing significant and widespread disruption to the health service, with up to 30,000 medical procedures and appointments being cancelled. That follows on from the 14,000 appointments that were cancelled last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> This dispute has been left to fester by successive governments for more than 20 years. The issues at the centre of this strike did not fall out of the sky. Medical scientists are paid 8% less than colleagues who perform identical work in hospital laboratories. Laboratory aids who report to medical scientists receive a higher starting salary than the medical scientists do. Medical scientists have fewer education and progression opportunities than comparable colleagues do. These issues have been raised continuously with governments for more than two decades by medical scientists and their representatives but nothing has been done. Unfair pay and a failure to address poor conditions has led to a chronic retention and recruitment crisis in the profession. We see that 20% of approved hospital posts are currently unfilled and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, states that the Department of Health and the HSE are ignoring burnout in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> Let the Taoiseach make no mistake about it - medical scientists are on strike today because of a basic lack of respect and recognition of the crucial role they play in delivery of health services. They are among the unsung heroes of this pandemic. Medical scientists essentially designed our Covid-19 testing system from scratch. They suspended industrial action for more than two years. They put aside their grievances for the good of the people and their contribution in the fight against the virus was invaluable. Medical scientists stood up and went beyond the call of duty. Now the Taoiseach's Government has left them standing on the picket line for a second week.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The MLSA says that since the first strike action last Wednesday neither the Department of Health nor the HSE has come to it with a meaningful proposal or an invitation to talks that could resolve the issues. That is incredible. Medical scientists deserve far better than that. The tens of thousands of patients whose medical appointments have been cancelled deserve much better. What we need is a fresh set of urgent talks. We need talks urgently with the aim of getting a resolution. Crucially, these talks must involve the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which puts the money on the table at the end of the day. It has to be at the table. Last week the Taoiseach said that he recognised the hugely important work done by medical scientists. He also urged them to engage with the industrial relations mechanisms. That is exactly what they are doing, but there is still no resolution to this issue. It comes down to this: does the Taoiseach accept that medical scientists have a legitimate and fair claim? If so, will he now intervene with the Department of Health, the HSE and, crucially, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order that together they may bring a meaningful proposal to the MLSA to resolve this dispute and ensure it does not go into a third week?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">Tá ról faoi leith ag na heolaithe leighis sa chóras sláinte. Bhí an ról sin soiléir le linn na paindéime. Admhaím go bhfuil ceist ann agus go bhfuil siad ag lorg parity idir iad féin agus na clinical biochemists le fada an lá anois. Is í an chaoi is fearr chun na ceisteanna seo a réiteach ná trí cainteanna laistigh den phróiseas atá ann chun ceisteanna den saghas seo a réiteach. I mo thuairim, dá mbeadh cainteanna substaintiúla ann, beimis in ann na ceisteanna seo a réiteach sa deireadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I acknowledge and pay tribute to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of medical scientists throughout the country. They were instrumental and crucial in respect of our response to Covid-19 and the pandemic, and are clearly an intricate part of the delivery of care within our health service. The MLSA wants pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists. It was recommended by an expert group in 2000 or 2001. That was broken by benchmarking between the two grades at the time of the 2002 benchmarking process. There is a clearly defined grade structure with promotional opportunities for medical scientists within the HSE. The Building Momentum public service agreement provided for sectoral bargaining within that overall framework. In addition to that, we believe it is particularly important that this gets into a proper process either in the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, or within the Labour Court. In my view, optimal use must be made of the industrial relations machinery of the State - whether that be the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court - in regard to resolving this issue. Significant informal contact occurred over the weekend on the issue of getting all sides into the process at the WRC or the Labour Court to get this resolved within a broad industrial relations framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> At the end of the day, the Government wants a resolution of this. I am sure the MLSA wants a resolution on behalf of medical laboratory scientists. However, such a resolution must always of conscious of potential implications and relativities, and so on. It must be clearly and transparently done and signed off in respect of the processes in play. The objective of all the informal contacts over the weekend has been to get people comfortable about going into a process, in terms of a proper outcome for all concerned. We are anxious to get this resolved. There has been overall growth in the number of medical scientists of about 6% since 2019. I acknowledge there have been increases at the higher level but not at the basic grade.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">We want to improve that. The HSE is embarking on a recruitment campaign. Additional funding is being made available in the Estimates for 2022 to facilitate that. Approximately 160 development posts are being recruited in addition to replacement posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The resolution of this lies in the full utilisation of the labour relations machinery of the State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_10">Medical scientists have been waiting for 20 years for the Government to turn up and deliver. They do not need plaudits. They do not need applause. What they need is a government to step up to the plate, recognise the invaluable work they do in the health service and recognise all of the work that they have done over the past number of years. They have been waiting 20 years for a government to hear their legitimate grievances and act. They are out on strike today because they have had enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> We cannot allow this to go into a third week and the disruption that that will have to the health services with three more days of strike next week. The Taoiseach says that we need to use the industrial relations mechanisms. I agree with that, but all parties need to turn up. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, needs to be at the table. The people who will pay at the end of the day need to be involved in these talks. I am asking the Taoiseach, again, if he will direct the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get around the table with the medical scientists to come up with some sort of resolution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_4">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">First, the health sector management has engaged with the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, over the course of 2021 and, more recently, through the sectoral bargaining process under Building Momentum 2021-2022. The Public Service Agreement Group, PSAG, recommended that the parties re-engage at the WRC. That is where it has been over the past week or so - endeavouring to get back into the process. There was further engagement with the MLSA in relation to that. Unfortunately, no resolution was reached last week in respect of that, but I am hoping. I urge all parties to use either the WRC or, potentially, the Labour Court, to bring about a resolution of this. The full arm of Government, in terms of the full continuum of Government through its different Departments and agencies, then would be involved in that process to get an outcome, once and for all, on this particular issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> We understand the role that the medical scientists play. We understand the impact of this disruption of patients as well - we are very concerned about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">That is why we want to get this resolved. We believe it can be if we can get a proper basis for engagement with the WRC or the Labour Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I too want to raise the issue of the medical scientists' strike this week. The health services are under severe strain and this is really showing that. It is reported that 30,000 procedures will be cancelled this week due to the two-day strike but the reality is that the disruption is much greater than that. Another 14,000 outpatient appointments will be cancelled each day as a result of the strike. Thousands of inpatient procedures, day-case elective procedures, maternity appointments and all the routine GP testing appointments will also have to be cancelled. The strike is completely disabling the health service. It just shows the importance of this particular profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> We must be clear that the dispute is doing that and it is having serious consequences for patients right across the country. To give an indication of how serious it was this morning, on "Morning Ireland", Mr. Tony Canavan, the CEO of the Saolta group, stated that he was concerned that deterioration in the conditions of inpatients in hospital would not be detected because of the lack of regular testing. We cannot go on with this. Certainly, we cannot countenance another three days of strike next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I do not believe the people who are on the picket line want to be on the picket line. They want a resolution to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Patient safety is clearly being put at risk. It is having a hugely negative impact on patients, some of whom have been on waiting lists for many years, seeing long-awaited procedures being cancelled. The strike will cause further chaos with delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, avoidable patient pain and suffering, and expanding waiting lists with which we already have a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Medical scientists are the hidden heroes of the health service, the people who patients never get to meet, but patients' treatment and care are dependent on their hard work.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Despite this, and as has been mentioned, they are paid 8% less than biochemists and they do broadly the same work. They are paid less than laboratory aides, who have much less responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> What is the Government proposing as a means to resolve this dispute? We were told last week the public service agreement group had recommended that the dispute be referred to the WRC. The MLSA has agreed to engage with the WRC but not to lift the strike action. However, the union has said that neither the HSE nor the Department of Health has approached it with any meaningful proposal or invitation to talks. There must be some talking in order to get the two sides engaged. What can the Taoiseach say he can do to bring these two sides to the table? Why has neither the HSE nor the Department of Health approached the MLSA with meaningful proposals they can talk about? The apparatus of the State is fine as long as there is something on which to engage. Will the Taoiseach tell us how he sees this being resolved?</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I acknowledge the disruption being caused as a result of strike action. It is having an impact and will continue to affect patients. I do not think anybody wants that and the MLSA does not want it either, to be fair, but this is having an impact. There is a very strong desire to get this matter resolved. What has been going on through informal contacts is to get a basis for participation now, following failed attempts in the past number of weeks through the WRC and the public service agreement group. It is about getting the basis right, if you like, for all parties to participate either in the WRC or in the Labour Court, which could be the way forward in getting a resolution to this dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> It is a dispute of long standing but in these cases, there are always further implications. The broader consideration of this must be within that context also. In other words, people must be fully aware of all the implications of any particular agreement on a specific matter, particularly in the health service. Anybody involved with the health service knows that to be the case historically. Experience informs us that a deal in one particular location of the health service can have repercussions across the entire service that may not have been envisaged at the outset. The best way to resolve an issue of that kind is to either use the WRC or the Labour Court so the details can be hammered out and ring-fenced to ensure we can get a resolution to this in the best interests of all concerned. That includes medical scientists, patients and the public at large. It is what the Government is endeavouring to do here.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> There is no dispute about the need to get this resolved and we have provided funding to expand the numbers working. Currently we have approximately 2,135 whole-time equivalents in the sector and we want to expand that through additional posts. We want to create a framework and basis to have a lasting resolution to this dispute.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Approximately 20% of medical scientist posts are currently unfilled. It appears the pharmaceutical sector is finding no difficulty in attracting people with these qualifications but there is a reluctance to take up positions because of poor pay and a lack of parity and respect. There is also an issue with career progression. Will the Taoiseach ensure there is a formal invitation issued by the HSE and the Department of Health to the MLSA and that there is a realistic basis for a resolution to this?</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We all understand there is industrial relations apparatus and it must be used. There must be a basis, nonetheless, and we must have a formal invitation in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_28">Will the Taoiseach make sure a formal invitation is issued? Will he make sure there is a basis for a resolution? There is no way the other side will engage if there is not a basis for a resolution.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I take the Deputy's point but, as she knows, before a formal invitation issues one would like to know there is a basis for it to be accepted. A lot of informal work and contact goes on all of the time between parties with a view to getting the right basis to facilitate participation in these mechanisms at the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court. Each year approximately half of the graduates from the colleges go to the health service. There has been a significant increase in senior posts and specialist posts over the past three years and that is the way it should be. We want to continue to invest in the service. We are working to make sure we can get a proper basis and an invitation process in place that would lead to participation by all concerned in the labour relations machinery of the State to get this dispute settled.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">On standing for election I gave a commitment to the people of Waterford city and county and the south east that I would do my utmost for our regional hospital, University Hospital Waterford, and the patients it serves. Yet again, I have to bring the issue of the hospital's underresourcing onto the Dáil floor. Recent work on heart attacks by the National Office of Clinical Audit using data from 2017 to 2020 demonstrates that no patient from the south-east region is getting to alternative cardiac care when the cath lab at University Hospital Waterford is closed. In addition, in 134 blue-light emergency transfers from Waterford to Cork in the years from 2019 to 2022, the average time elapsed was three hours and 15 minutes. The national clinical protocol for heart attack requires cath lab access within 90 minutes from first responder. Every heart attack patient from the south-east region is exposed to additional heart damage and medical trauma and increased morbidity because of the lack of treatments available in the location where it is required, which the Taoiseach promised he would provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I have watched the Government walk through walls to build a hospital that is largely for the people of south Dublin. I have watched the Government parties whip their Deputies furiously to get them to support the national maternity hospital project despite misgivings as to its ultimate ownership. I heard the rationale offered by the Tánaiste, our next Taoiseach, in the debate in this House when he stated the maternity hospital needs to be in Dublin because if a woman has a cardiac arrest she can be in ICU within 20 minutes. The Hippocratic oath extends to the people of Waterford and the south-east also.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Over the past two years I have seen the Taoiseach in action. I would say he is a formidable operator. He gets his way. He can build a new runway in Cork in less than six months from a standing start. He can green-light the Dunkettle interchange. He is certainly a man of his word to his electorate and the people of Cork. On behalf of my electorate and the people I represent, I need a simple "Yes" or "No" answer from the Taoiseach today. Will he keep his promise to the people of Waterford and the south east? Will a 24-7 emergency cardiac care service be in place when he leaves the Taoiseach's office in December?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue and generally for his consistency in raising these issues in respect of Waterford University Hospital and the broader constituency. He referenced the national maternity hospital. That was first announced in 2013. It is now 2022. It is questionable as to whether too many walls have been gone through. It took seven years to get to a point where a decision was taken to build it. In the case of Waterford the issue in recent years has been the cath lab. Work on the construction of the second cath lab commenced in March 2021. It will be completed by the end of August. The second cath lab will be available for operational use from the end of October this year. This is in the context of Covid-19, with the shutdown in construction. The second cath lab will mirror the existing cath lab and will be able to undertake the full range of diagnostic, interventional and non-interventional cardiac procedures available in the existing upgraded cath lab.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">All consultant cardiology posts are currently filled in the hospital. There is an issue with the recruitment of an additional registrar to support the 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday service. That position is being recruited as a matter of urgency. A total of 24 whole-time equivalents were approved by the South/South West Hospital Group in November 2021 for the staffing of the second cath lab, which is a significant commitment to the undertakings we gave the Deputies and representatives of the south east. We are awaiting the presentation and publication of the national review of specialist cardiac services. The overall budget of the hospital has increased by about €60 million since January 2020, which is a 20% increase and a significant commitment to University Hospital Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> I accept the Deputy's point about timely care and that having the right care at the right time in the right place is critical. More generally, we want to develop further services at University Hospital Waterford in addition to the second cath lab. In terms of the capital programmes, in particular, as the Deputy knows, a report is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks. That review has been strategically examining the current and future capacity requirements of University Hospital Waterford to ensure that proper planning is in place for the next 15 years to invest in the hospital. The South/South West Hospital Group will work with HSE estates to make the relevant capital submissions for new developments that are required at the hospital. HSE estates has confirmed that a submission will be made at the capital steering committee for the development of additional bed capacity for the hospital. There has been significant investment across Waterford but I do not have time to go into that now. Perhaps it could be given as a supplementary response.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I was hoping for a "Yes" or "No" answer but I understand that the Taoiseach feels he cannot give it. With the additional money put into University Hospital Waterford, it still remains the most underfunded of nine model 4 hospitals in the country. That is the first issue. Second, the Taoiseach talked about the provision of additional services to the cardiac care suite. What he is offering us is an aeroplane with no pilots, baggage people or transportation on the ground to operate it. Without the people, we cannot operate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> We need a 24-7 service, which the Taoiseach and his party committed to in 2016. The lack of care, attention and interest in following up on this promise over the years is quite evident now. The people of the south east will have their say. Either the service will be in place in December and the Taoiseach's word will have demonstrated its worth or it will not. I apologise to him for saying that but I have to keep the promises I made to fight for this vital service.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> We are past reviews. We had 134 blue-light transfers over three years. Not one of them could get out of Waterford to Cork in under three and a quarter hours. It is no longer a clinical case. It is a political decision. It is up to the Government to either follow through on what it promised to do or else not follow through and leave it to the electorate to decide how it appreciates and takes that.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">There is an ongoing crisis in our mental health service for children and young adults. There are 3,900 young people on waiting lists, up 40% in the past year. One would imagine that for the HSE, this would require an urgent response to increase services, but quite incredibly, the HSE has announced a national cut in services, with the closure of almost half the beds in the Linn Dara facility in Cherry Orchard. Linn Dara is a key facility for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, nationally, and for the greater Dublin area and counties Wicklow, Kildare and Louth, in particular. The HSE has stated these bed closures, a reduction of 11 beds, down from 24 to 13, is a consequence of shortages of qualified staff. The CAMHS unit in Cherry Orchard should have 51 nurses. It only has 24. There is an ongoing problem with recruitment and retention in the health service as a whole. We have heard this from the medical scientists. The Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, has described the bed closures at Linn Dara as a consequence of poor planning by the HSE. The PNA has pointed out that similar closures took place five years ago in 2017, but it seems nothing has been learned since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Mental Health Reform, a national coalition of groups concerned with mental health issues and services, has called for the reinstatement of a national director on mental health to report directly to Mr. Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE. It has stated this post is essential to ensure proper oversight and leadership in the improvement of mental health services nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> In 2006, A Vision for Change was adopted as a Government policy to transform these services. A Vision for Change called for 100 beds to be available. We now have just 56 beds nationally following the closure of the Cherry Orchard facility. Mental Health Reform has also pointed out these reductions in beds could mean that children may end up being admitted to adult mental health treatment units, which would be in contravention of their human rights. The reductions will mean young people will face increasing difficulties in accessing care in a situation where long delays can have a devastating effect on families and children in need of early intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> What has happened makes a mockery of the Sharing the Vision policy, which followed A Vision for Change. There is a need for urgent action. The reduction in beds and overall service at the time of an escalating crisis is simply unacceptable. What action does the Taoiseach propose to take? It is not good enough to say that there is a problem with recruitment and retention. The situation requires urgent action.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">I thank the Deputy for raising this most important issue. The issue of CAMHS and bed capacity is a serious one, particularly the decision in relation to Linn Dara and the reduction of beds there, due to a range of issues, as the Deputy has said. In the first instance, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is working with the HSE intensively to ensure this is a temporary situation and to get it reversed. As the Deputy has said, a number of beds are now not in operation in Linn Dara. The same applies to Merlin Park University Hospital for different reasons. Ten out of 12 beds are operational in St. Joseph's Hospital, and all of the 16 beds in Eist Linn are fully operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The regrettable situation in Linn Dara has come about because a number of nursing posts have become vacant simultaneously for various reasons. It is not a resources or a funding issue but a staffing recruitment issue. The nursing complement available through the use of permanent and agency staff is no longer sufficient to continue to provide a full 24-bed inpatient service to a safe standard. That was the basis and the rationale for the decision taken. There are still seven beds available at Linn Dara specifically for the treatment of eating disorders. No young person was discharged early from the unit as a result of the reduced bed numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The reduction in beds at Merlin Park is due to the reconfiguration of two shared bedrooms to single rooms because of Covid, nursing staff vacancies and physical risks associated with some rooms. The two-bedroom reductions in St. Joseph's are due to staff vacancies and physical limitations of the unit, as advised by consultant psychiatrists.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The HSE explored all options prior to making the decision. For example, it looked at redeploying staff from other CAMHS units or teams. It was not in a position to do that, and it did not want to impact negatively on CAMHS community care and the CAMHS community teams, which are a key part of the broader CAMHS programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">All four CAMHS units nationally will work collaboratively to maximise the use of national CAMHS bed capacity over the coming while. The Minister of State and the HSE will work to intensify efforts to recruit the specialist skills and people for the vacancies that currently exist. To the end of March 2022, there have not been any admissions of under-18s to adult facilities. In 2021, there were 25 such admissions, down from 50 in 2019. That is something that we do not want to see happening within our mental health services, particularly in respect of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> Some 91% of urgent CAMHS referrals are now seen within 48 hours. Record funding of €1.149 billion is being provided for CAMHS, which again is up significantly on last year, but it is an issue of recruiting the specialist nursing staff.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_58">I repeat that there are 3,900 young people on waiting lists, which is up by 40% on last year. Covid-19 has had an impact on the mental health of many young people and adults over the past two years. To see the HSE cutting beds rather than maintaining them is completely incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The Taoiseach said the HSE has been looking to bring in teams from other areas. The issue that arises is that where any child is brought to an adult care facility, it will be breaking their human rights. They should be cared for within CAMHS. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to stand up and say what he has just said there. This should have been well planned for. The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people launched the implementation of the Sharing the Vision policy and it should have been well flagged if there was a problem. It should have been addressed a long time ago if we were having staffing problems in the area six or eight months ago. This happened in 2017 and it has to be resolved immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">It has to be resolved but the level of service is also expanding all of the time. The level of referrals is also going up exponentially. Covid-19 without question had an impact on the number of young people contacting their primary care services and their community teams in respect of mental health issues arising out of the pandemic. This has been a feature across the health service in the past six months as we emerge from the emergency phase of the pandemic where there has been an exponential growth in activity and in referrals, which is exacerbating the problems and issues we have. The funding has been provided to recruit as many people as we possibly can in all of the different disciplines, and that will continue. In the meantime, the Minister of State will work with the HSE to see what we can do, especially in respect of the Linn Dara facility. There is an urgency attached to that and I thank the Deputy for having raised it.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">RTÉ reported today that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will be bringing plans to Cabinet to amend the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 to ensure finance from outside the State does not influence selections. This is a very positive development, which we welcome. We have been calling for it for some time, but it needs to be done properly. These amendments, strictly speaking, are outside the scope of the legislation. I spoke in detail on Second Stage of the Bill about the need to introduce legislation on this matter. We are quite surprised that the media have been told that the amendments in this regard will be introduced to the Electoral Reform Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> Tomorrow at 11 a.m. is the deadline for amendments to the legislation. Given that there are such significant changes to the initial scope of the Bill, what is needed now - there is precedent for it - is a return to a form of mini-Second Stage debate to discuss in detail some of the significant proposals the Minister appears likely to make in regard to the financing of politics from outside the State. We would welcome that important debate and it is one we should have in this House. I propose that we delay Committee Stage to allow that debate to happen in detail on Second Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">Will the Government consider having some discussion on what it has been talking about doing in regard to a vacant property tax, of which we are very much in favour? There has been some discussion on this in the Oireachtas committee, which I understand will publish a report today on the whole issue. It is a matter of extreme urgency that we address the issue of vacant and derelict properties, which could be used to help us to deal with the housing crisis. Does the Government have any plans for some sort of discussion about its own thoughts on the housing committee report and to give us an opportunity to debate this urgent issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_118">As Deputy Mattie McGrath knows, two hours are allocated tomorrow for the People Before Profit Deputies in Private Members' time, which gives adequate time to discuss the industrial dispute to which he referred. If further time is required, we can discuss it at the meeting of the Business Committee on Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> In regard to the Electoral Reform Bill, I welcome Deputy Nash's positive comments regarding the Minister's amendments. The latter has given a commitment that a comprehensive briefing will be given to all Opposition parties on the amendments. There also will be full and adequate time given at the committee to debate the amendments being proposed. There will be no time restrictions in that regard. As the Deputy knows, there is no provision within Standing Orders to revert to a Second Stage debate on the legislation. However, full time will be given on Committee Stage and there will be full engagement with Opposition Deputies on the point raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> A debate on the housing committee's report is something we could prioritise, with the agreement of the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee, for the Thursday evening lottery slot. It is a topical issue and the recommendations made require debate in the House. If Members are happy to do so, perhaps the report, which is published today, can be prioritised at the meeting of the Business Committee for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">Families are in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis. Those who were planning to holiday in Ireland this summer are being asked to think again as they are faced with sky-high accommodation costs. It is much worse for families from down the country, including in my constituency and elsewhere, who need to travel to Dublin for a hospital appointment - perhaps a child's appointment - and who cannot find accommodation or, at least, accommodation they can afford. In April, hotel and other accommodation prices increased by 8%. In the past year, they have gone up by 20%. We see hotels in Dublin charging eye-watering levels that people simply cannot afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> The hotel sector, understandably, received billions of taxpayers' money during the pandemic and it is enjoying an extension of the 9% VAT rate, which will cost the State and taxpayers €900 million. Have the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media engaged with the sector and with the Irish Hotels Federation to discuss the prices that are being charged? Have they outlined the expectation that the reduction in VAT that will be extended is to be passed on to customers and is not to benefit the pockets or profits of the industry?</p>

          <p eId="para_124">I agree it is important that businesses are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its position as a destination that gives value for money. I acknowledge the Deputy's concerns that the tourism sector maintains its competitive edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Deputy is correct in saying that we have extended the VAT reduction and a whole other range of supports, especially supports around Covid. I will ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Tánaiste to revert to the Deputy on the specific details of their engagements with the sector. It is important that Ireland does not lose its competitive edge and that we ensure businesses provide value for money for domestic tourists but also for those who are arriving on our shores.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I will bring up the issue of the medical scientists' industrial action and direct it to the Minister for Health, as he is here. The remarkable decision not to return to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, after last week's day of action needs to be answered properly. The Taoiseach said that there have been "informal" talks but in his next sentence, he said that things have to be done "transparently". Where is the transparency in that? I have to ask the Minister of Health the question that was asked of me this morning on the picket line: is this a deliberate tactic by the Government to break the resolve of the workers? I refer to the decision not to return to the WRC in the last week. We see more spin by the Government today that there will be an expansion of the number of medical scientists by more than 4%. Actually, it is not expansion, it is replacement because of the retention crisis they have. Is this a deliberate tactic to break the resolve of the workers? If not, can the Minister understand why the workers would believe that it is?</p>

The recommendation for PSAG under Building Momentum was that all sides would revert to the WRC, critically without industrial action. We are all aware that it is causing very significant disruption to the acute sector. There are patients waiting on quite urgent surgery who are having that surgery cancelled. The Deputy and I know that none of those on the picket lines want that. They have worked incredibly hard. They have done incredibly difficult and vital work right through the pandemic.

Some 35 children with cystic fibrosis, CF, between the ages of six and 11 have been excluded from accessing the life-changing CF drug therapy, Kaftrio. There was no expectation that these children would be excluded from this drug therapy and the news has come as a crushing blow for the parents and children. Will the Minister confirm if it is indeed a pricing dispute between the HSE and the pharmaceutical company, Vertex, that has resulted in this? What measures is he taking to resolve this impasse for these children?</p>

          <p eId="para_131">The issue is very much of concern for the 35 children involved and their families. I am engaging with the Department and the HSE on this. As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement on medicines under the community drug scheme and for administration of this scheme. Reimbursement is for the licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation. What is important to me and, no doubt, to the Deputy is that the children get access to the drug they need. Intensive work is going on between the Department, the HSE and the companies involved to that end.</p>

We were here five years ago. Alarm bells ring when a state-of-the-art facility such as Linn Dara, which provides an absolutely vital service for young people, cannot provide staff. If this happened five years ago, why did the HSE and the Department of Health not foresee this? It is just not acceptable, in 2022, that a facility such as Linn Dara should have to close beds. Nobody accepts that, but it has happened. Will somebody answer these questions, not just for me, but most importantly for the parents and the people who will use this facility?</p>

There are 51 funded posts for nurses in Linn Dara and there are 24 staff currently in place. From a patient safety perspective, the facility has been working at between 60% and 70% capacity for the last few months. I am aware that there have been challenges. Every effort has been made with agency staff and trying to bring staff in from multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams in the community. Unfortunately, the issue with staffing is why beds have been closed. Four triaged young people are currently waiting for admittance to the Linn Dara facility. Some 50% of those are in hospital and 50% are receiving community supports. Across the whole country, 11 young people have been triaged and are waiting for supports.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">Last month was the 20th anniversary of a meeting that the Taoiseach and I attended with Margaret Best and officials from the Department of Health about the State's introduction of a no-fault vaccine compensation scheme. Over the past two decades, while governments have been committed to the introduction of such a scheme in the interests of public health and the individuals concerned, we have always remained one report away from action. Now we have all of those reports on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. When can we expect the commitment, which has been promised for a long time, to be implemented?</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I agree entirely with the Deputy's sentiment. We need this scheme. There have been multiple reports on it. It is being worked on. Unfortunately, it was delayed somewhat by Covid. I know the Deputy will appreciate that many of the resources of the Department and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor had to be diverted to requirements arising due to Covid. It is being looked at. We need to go further because there has been a growing medical negligence sector. Many doctors report that they have to practise defensive medicine, which is in nobody's interests. We need to introduce the scheme. I will revert to the Deputy with a note on that. We need to go further.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">There is something inherently wrong with the felling licences situation at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The number of licences being issued to Coillte is 135% of the target outlined in the Department's forestry licensing plan 2022. Farmers and private landowners have only received 80% of the target number of licences in the same period. Afforestation is only at 54% of its target. The system is not functioning fairly for all applicants. Coillte seems to have no problem getting the licences, but ordinary farmers or businesspeople who invested in afforestation cannot get the licences. Will the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, explain how Coillte has got 135% of its target number of applications over the line this year alone, not to mention previous years, while ordinary applicants, such as farmers or businesspeople, are delayed? There is prevarication and all kinds of obstacles are put in their way.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">There has been significant investment in the Department's resources, with more ecologists, forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff assigned to licensing. A team of 35 ecologists has been recruited to deal specifically with licensing. In 2021, 56% more licences were issued than in 2020, with 4,050 licences issued, compared with 2,592 licences issued in 2020. In terms of improved output, some 2,877 felling licences were issued last year, 1,532 of which were for Coillte. Critically, the availability of this volume of timber, at nearly 8.5 million cu. m, stabilised supply to the processing sector in 2021. That was the highest volume ever issued in a single year. Some 264 km of forest roads were licensed in 2021, which is more than double the target in the climate action plan of 2019. It was the highest ever volume of forest roads licensed in a single year. The number of afforestation licences remains static, with approximately 4,000 ha of planning approved in 2021.</p>

I have been contacted about the number of home care workers across the country who are currently employed on immigration visas. I have been informed that on previous occasions, the Department of Justice has issued an automatic renewal for visas about to expire. </p>
          <p eId="para_140">The most recent automatic renewal only applies to visas due to expire before 31 May 2022. This means, for example, that more than 100 carers employed in south Dublin whose visas expire shortly after that date are ineligible for auto-extension. To date, no such extension of these immigration permits have been announced. We are in a difficult situation with home carers. Will the Minister look at extending the auto-extension process urgently in respect of these cases?</p>

For months now I have been working with communities from Ceathrú Thaidhg, Porturlin, Srahataggle and Portacloy in north Mayo who are all desperate to avail of a new community water connection. It is hard to believe that in 2022, rural dwellers in County Mayo are still without a piped water supply. This is severely impacting their living standards and quality of life. Hundreds of signatures have been gathered from local residents allowing Mayo County Council engineers to assess the proposed scheme for inclusion in the future multi-annual rural water programme, benefitting these four rural Mayo communities. A pre-water connection was submitted to Irish Water for this new community water scheme, which was deemed to be feasible. My concern is that Mayo County Council and many local authorities have yet to receive the framework for the submission process from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to submit their funding bids for the new four-year cycle. I would appreciate an update on this and when local authorities will be allowed to submit.</p>

To give the Deputy an idea for timeframes, the working group is currently finalising a report due. That should be with me in the coming weeks to make recommendations. I will not be delaying upon it. Coincidentally, I was in the constituency of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on Friday. We were looking at another rural water scheme there which is very successful. The Government supports this and I thank the Deputy for raising it. We want the process to move on now. Once I receive the report which I expect in the coming weeks, I will revert to the Deputy and inform the House.</p>

This week we have seen the Israeli apartheid regime refuse entry to an EU delegation to the occupied Palestinian territories. This delegation included two Irish MEPs.

          <p eId="para_148"> On top of that, we have also seen the murder of the American Palestinian journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh.

          <p eId="para_150">The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here but he should know that 5,300 taxi vehicle licences will expire next year because of the vehicle age limit. That represents a huge proportion of our taxi fleet. Let us remember that taxi drivers were hammered for two years. They essentially had no income for two years, so they are asking for a further vehicle life extension to allow them to raise the money to buy other vehicles. In many cases, they will be raising money to buy electric vehicles. I am told the latter are not available. It is almost impossible to get electric vehicles that are suitable as taxis. Also, they are very expensive. You can get a grant of up to €20,000 but the vehicles cost up to €55,000 or more. Taxi drivers therefore need some assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Taxi drivers are also asking me about the statutory instrument that would require them to have a cashless payment facility. While 90% of them have such a facility, drivers need to be protected to ensure the onus is still on the customer to pay the fare.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">My question is for the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. On Friday, 8 April, staff at the minor injuries unit in Cashel were told the unit would be closed from the following Monday because of the inability to replace a doctor who had left because of the low pay. After hearing this, we made inquiries. Fair play to the HSE in that we were told the unit would open fairly quickly, which it did, but last week I found myself having to make inquiries again because the unit is now open for only two out of five days because of the pay issue. The HSE states it has a problem finding a doctor to take on the full-time role. This is happening at a time when our emergency departments, especially those in Limerick and Clonmel, which service Tipperary, are under severe pressure. We see how pay issues are forcing the medical scientists to go on strike. What is being done to ensure units like the one in question will not fall victim to problems over pay and subsequent difficulties in securing staff? Could I please get a straight answer from the Minister today?</p>

The development in question is of concern to me and of considerable concern to the local community. We are working on it and I will revert to the Deputy with a note on it.

We are talking about passport demand increasing by approximately 50% in a year. This summer, we will have 900 people in the Passport Office. Last summer, it was 460. This year, we have a special phone line for Oireachtas offices. It has been under pressure and we are adding more people to it today. It has taken well over 10,000 calls so far this year, however. Obviously, we are also looking to put more people on the public call line and the webchat service. We are upscaling by putting far more people in to respond to a massive increase in demand, but we also rely on the public to make sure the applications are online and accurate, where possible. The problems are nearly always linked to first-time applicants. Of all renewals, 43% are given back within 48 hours. It is important to focus on the positives as well as the negatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">I thank the Deputy. I look forward to reading the report from Deputy Matthews and other colleagues on the housing committee. We will be moving forward with the Croí Cónaithe towns and villages fund. We have identified it as a pathway to housing and to tackling vacancy. All three parties in government are serious about doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> As regards work on a vacant property tax, data from the local property tax is being collated in the Department of Finance. It and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in conjunction with me, will assess those data in the coming weeks. We have clearly set out an objective within Housing for All that we will move on a vacant property tax. It is not the silver bullet. It is one of several measures we can take. Work is not yet finalised. The Chief Whip made the point earlier that the report of the joint committee would be a good one for the House to debate. I look forward to reading it. I will keep the Deputy appraised.</p>

        <heading>Dereliction and Building Regeneration Bill 2022: First Stage<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T15:10:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#StevenMatthews" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Deputy Steven Matthews<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_176">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_177">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for identification, management, restoration and bringing back to use of derelict buildings and to simplify and expedite applications to refurbish or change the use of upper floors or ‘over the shop’ for residential use by establishing in each local authority a special planning and building control approval system to be called a Town Centre First application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">This is the first Private Member's Bill I have produced and introduced in the Oireachtas. I am honoured and privileged to have the opportunity to do so. The Bill is presented to the House in the context of the ongoing housing and homelessness crises. Despite these crises, we know there are between 90,000 and 180,000 vacant homes left idle across the country. There are also derelict sites. Those figures come from GeoDirectory and census figures. I am conscious of what the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, just stated in terms of getting more figures from local property tax returns and census 2022 when that information is in.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Many towns are blighted by vacancy. Many buildings are left neglected and derelict. The figures I quoted do not include the second or third floors of many town centre buildings, which could provide a significant amount of housing. I know that some of these figures may be disputed and the Government is awaiting local property tax returns but there seems to be a sense that vacancy is not as high as the Central Statistics Office and GeoDirectory figures indicate. Anecdotal evidence suggests it is, however. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage today produced a report that highlights the need for good and accurate data. There are so many data collection points out there; we need to bring all the data together so that we can be well informed if we are going to implement objectives and legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The Green Party is committed to rejuvenating towns, villages and cities and ensuring they are fit for purpose for people and families to live, work and play. To this end, the Bill simplifies the planning process to make it easier for old buildings and over-the-shop units to be brought back into residential use. The Bill as presented is in two Parts. The first Part amends the Derelict Sites Act to expand the definition of "dereliction" which, currently, is far too vague. It aims to modernise communication methods with owners of derelict sites and for local government to address that and ensure that the Minister is informed of all long-term derelict sites on the register. Specifically, the amendments expand the definition of "dereliction" from relating simply to how the building looks to including buildings that are damaged or neglected, as well as buildings that were once residential but are no longer habitable without remedial work. This will ensure more buildings can be added to the derelict register and addressed under dereliction taxes or levies. The Bill expands the definition of "urban land" to cover all land in towns, villages and cities and removes the requirement for the Minister to have to make regulations to define "urban". It will ensure the derelict sites register is available online and is a modern and publicly accessible register. The Bill requires local authorities to inform the Minister for housing when sites have been on the derelict sites register for a period of two years. I had included a vacant homes tax in the Bill but I am glad to hear the Government is moving on that issue. That is probably the quicker and more direct route for the Minister to move on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> The second Part of the Bill relates to expediting and improving the process for bringing the over-the-shop units that we see throughout all towns and villages, urban and rural, into residential use. The amendments propose to establish a special planning and building control approval process referred to in the Bill as the town centres first application process. Each planning authority will be enabled to expedite these applications for certain classes of residential developments in order to bring vacant stock back into use through refurbishment or change of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> The Bill specifically targets requiring change of use from commercial or industrial to residential, as well as residential refurbishment in older structures or the upper floors of properties. It provides a streamlined and faster process for consenting building upgrades associated with fire safety and accessibility certificates, planning and self-certification. Those elements can add considerable time and expense for a person who wishes to do a job such as that. The streamlined process will speed up the process and remove much of the uncertainty for those who wish to carry out this work in the context of the three or four separate processes. Those processes often make these types of works financially unviable and difficult to plan. It is important to stress that the process does not seek to reduce standards but, rather, would provide for rigorous independent inspections and a simplified set of regulations aimed at typical small over-the-shop units in town centres or conversion and reuse type developments. I believe thousands of those units will become available if we take these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The Bill has been well researched. I thank Kate Ruddock and Bríd McGrath for their considerable work on it. Addressing dereliction and providing the specialised building control approval process would contribute to bringing life back to towns and villages and help support local economies. It supports the Town Centres First and Our Rural Future policies of the Government and future-proofs towns and villages in urban and rural settings.</p>

        <heading>Journalists in Conflicts across the World: Statements<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T15:10:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">At the outset, I thank Deputies for this important and timely debate. While the television cameras and eyes of the world most recently focused on the killings of journalists in Ukraine and the occupied Palestinian territory, we cannot afford to overlook attacks on journalists anywhere. Across the world, attacks against journalists occur against the background of growing authoritarianism, with associated restrictions on press freedom, increased cyber-surveillance and growth in disinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> In too many countries, attacks on journalists occur in tandem with a broader pushback against human rights in general and against civil and political rights in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The promotion and protection of all human rights remains a key foreign policy priority for Ireland. It is central to our commitment to a rules-based multilateral order, with the United Nations at its core. We unequivocally condemn impunity and demand protection for journalists, whether in situations of conflict or otherwise. I will speak later about our work on the UN Security Council, which actively reflects that commitment, both through our focus on ensuring accountability and our efforts to mainstream human rights across all areas of the Security Council agenda. It is also evident in our work as an active observer at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, which is the primary international forum responsible for advancing respect for human rights. Our previous membership in the council, from 2013 to 2015, enabled us to contribute substantively to the promotion and protection of all human rights. In order to continue this work, Ireland will seek our next term on the Human Rights Council for the period 2027 to 2029.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland also last week assumed the six-month Presidency of the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe, the Continent’s leading human rights organisation, for the seventh time. Much has changed since Ireland joined the Council of Europe as one of ten founding members in 1949. However, the council’s work on the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law is more vital than ever. This includes the independence of the media and safety of journalists across the 46 member states, including Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The most recent figures from Reporters without Borders provide a grim background for today’s debate. Some 939 journalists and media workers were killed across the globe during the ten years from 2011 to 2020. Last year alone, 50 journalists were killed and 302 were imprisoned. Every killing of a journalist represents an assault on democracy, is an attack on media freedom and demonstrates contempt for the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> While the protection of journalists is a global issue, it also resonates deeply with people across this island. I am proud that Ireland ranks sixth of the 180 countries in the latest World Press Freedom Index. However, our history reminds us that we cannot take press freedom for granted ever. We remember in particular the despicable killings in Northern Ireland of widely respected journalists Lyra McKee and Martin O’Hagan at the hands of paramilitary organisations. Likewise, the memory of the brutal murder of Veronica Guerin reminds us of the threat from organised crime networks. We also remember the two Irish camera operators killed while working overseas, Simon Cumbers, and more recently, Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed with his Ukrainian colleague on 14 March when their vehicle came under fire in Ukraine. I am also well aware that an increasing number of journalists, including Irish citizens, have faced expulsion or have been denied work permits to undertake media assignments abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The right to freedom of opinion and expression is defined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, as exercised by journalists and media, is fundamental to the protection and promotion of democracy, the rule of law and upholding all human rights. Having free, independent and pluralistic media, both online and offline, is crucial to any democratic society. It allows citizens and communities to make informed decisions and to hold governments accountable. Being able to work in safety allows journalists to fulfil their essential role in providing objective and unbiased information.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Journalists play an indispensable role in conflict-affected countries. They ensure that we know what is happening in some of the world’s most dangerous and inaccessible places. They report and document the realities and impacts of conflict and corruption. They uncover evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and human rights violations and abuses. They are often the first witnesses to report a conflict and its impact on the everyday lives of civilians. Their work can underpin steps towards accountability, justice and ultimately, peace. </p>
          <p eId="para_196"> International humanitarian law is clear. Journalists working in conflict zones must be afforded the same protections as civilians. Too often, though, they face violence and intimidation. Tragically, in some cases it is the "Press" logo emblazoned on their vests or armbands and intended to guarantee protection which leads instead to their being deliberately targeted. In too many cases, threats of killing and attacks against journalists go uninvestigated, allowing the perpetrators to act with impunity. This has a further chilling effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Women journalists are particularly at risk of marginalisation and are targeted disproportionately by harassment and violence. Offline, and increasingly online, we are now seeing an increase in the targeting of women journalists, including in situations where gender intersects with other forms of discrimination, including race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> During our term on the UN Security Council, Ireland is prioritising human rights and international humanitarian law. We have frequently called attention to attacks on media workers and have demanded accountability. We have condemned abductions and disappearances of journalists in Libya, called for an end to violence against media workers in Myanmar and spoken out against attacks on freedom of expression in Afghanistan. Last week at UN headquarters in New York, we called for a thorough, impartial and independent investigation into the case of Shireen Abu Akleh, who I expect will be the focus of many people's contributions today.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> In 2015, the Security Council adopted a dedicated resolution on the protection of journalists and we are determined to keep this issue on the agenda. Today, Ireland is hosting a meeting of Security Council members in New York that will focus specifically on the protection of journalists. We have called this meeting in response to recent cases where media workers have been killed. We have invited a number of experts to brief at the meeting, including Jon Williams of RTÉ, a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Irene Khan, the UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion, as well as representatives from Agence France-Presse and Al Jazeera. We will examine what more the Security Council and UN missions can do to protect journalists. We will highlight the vital need to address impunity and call on the UN Security Council to do everything possible to ensure accountability for crimes against media workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Let me focus for a moment on the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh on 11 May. I have already strongly condemned her killing, which took place while she was engaged in her work as a journalist. Today, I would like to restate my condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. Ms Abu Akleh was a successful and very well-respected journalist. Her reporting has been rightly praised for its tenacity and humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> We have all seen the shocking footage of Ms Abu Akleh’s funeral in Jerusalem on 13 May. I condemn the disgraceful actions of the Israeli police, including the totally unacceptable use of excessive force. These appalling events compound the trauma of those grieving, increase already heightened tension, particularly in Jerusalem, and show a complete disrespect for the dead. These actions were offensive to every sense of decency and have no place in any modern society. I welcome the widespread condemnation of Ms Abu Akleh’s killing from the international community, including the EU and UN. The EU issued a statement calling for a thorough and independent investigation and stressed the importance of supporting journalists, particularly those covering conflicts. High Representative Josep Borrell also highlighted the disproportionate use of force by the Israeli police at the funeral.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I echo the words of the UN special coordinator, Tor Wennesland, who said that an investigation must be immediate and thorough. The UN Secretary General also issued a statement urging an independent and transparent investigation and accountability for those responsible for Ms Abu Akleh's death. The Israeli Government must take definitive steps now to ensure swift accountability. It should not and cannot ignore these calls. A full independent, effective and transparent investigation into Ms Abu Akleh’s death is not only required, but demanded by the international community. The Israeli Government must now outline how it intends to achieve this in a credible way. Any delays make it more difficult to gather evidence and to hold those responsible to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The killing and the events afterwards at the funeral also sit within a broader context of heightened tensions throughout Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly in Jerusalem. I have been clear that the Israeli authorities must take concrete actions to de-escalate the situation. There is a real risk of further destabilisation, violence and the deaths of more innocent people. The events at Al-Aqsa during Ramadan have focused attention again on the holy sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">There are potentially significant flash points in the coming weeks, including the flag parade due to take place on 29 May. The Israeli authorities must act to avoid escalation.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> On 13 May, my Department and 13 other EU foreign ministries issued a statement expressing deep concern regarding the large number of new settlements approved for construction by the Israeli Higher Planning Council, and urging the Israeli authorities to reverse the decision. We also stated our opposition to the planned demolitions and evictions at Masafer Yatta. These decisions cannot be seen in isolation from the wider rise in tensions across Israel and Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> The impressive work of journalists, such as Shireen Abu Akleh, contributes to a greater understanding of the conflict. They work to ensure that this important issue continues to receive the international attention it deserves, that this long-running conflict is not forgotten and that the international community is reminded of its responsibility to strive for a lasting peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy. The work of journalists, such as Shireen, is critical to ensuring accountability. Without their witness, the suffering of people under occupation would be less visible. I call on the Israeli authorities to show that they take the fundamental democratic principle of accountability seriously; and that they are committed to ensuring there is no impunity for those guilty of wrongdoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I would also like to take the opportunity to address the decision by the Israeli authorities over the weekend to refuse entry to the Chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine as well as the decision to deny entry to Gaza to the members of this delegation, which included two Irish MEPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> I echo the concerns raised on this issue, including the comments of the European Parliament's President, Ms Roberta Metsola. As Ms Metsola has said, respect for MEPs and the European Parliament is essential for relations between the EU and Israel, now and in the future. I understand that Ms Metsola is currently in Israel on a separate visit and will raise this issue directly with the Israeli authorities. So she should.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> On Ukraine, Ireland has unequivocally condemned Russia's brutal and ruthless aggression in Ukraine. The loss of life as a direct result of Russia's actions is deplorable. Again, I strongly condemn the killing of all those journalists who have been working bravely to shine a light on the plight of Ukraine since the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> UN-appointed independent human rights experts, including the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, have warned that journalists in Ukraine have been deliberately targeted and continue to face unprecedented dangers while carrying out their work. At one point, we have seen some of that live on television. They have cited numerous reports indicating that journalists have been "targeted, tortured, kidnapped, attacked and killed, or refused safe passage" from cities and regions under siege.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> I have witnessed first-hand the devastating impact of Russia's indiscriminate behaviour and disregard for civilian lives, including journalists, in Ukraine. At least nine media workers have lost their lives in Ukraine since 24 February and more have been seriously wounded. This includes, as I mentioned earlier, an Irish citizen and journalist and his fellow Ukrainian journalist. They were killed on 14 March by Russian forces. I would like, again, to offer my deepest condolences to their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Ireland stands firmly with Ukraine and we stand firmly with all those journalists working to report on the barbarity being inflicted on Ukrainian people at this time. In April, Ireland contributed €20,000 to the International Federation of Journalists to provide emergency support to journalists in Ukraine. This funding provides front-line assistance and equipment, including helmets and flak jackets, secure communication tools, medical supplies and safety training and enables journalists to carry out their indispensable work on the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Russia's deliberate campaign of disinformation in relation to the war in Ukraine continues. It is thanks to the tireless work of journalists that the true nature of this conflict continues to be understood. This year, the journalists of Ukraine were collectively awarded the Pulitzer special citation for their courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Across Ukraine, we have seen Russian forces using indiscriminate explosive weapons, including prohibited cluster munitions, in populated areas and against civilian infrastructure. The toll of destruction of homes, hospitals and schools is testament to that. It speaks to an utter disregard by Russian forces for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> The value of free and impartial journalism in Ukraine is to shed a light on the truth and facts of Russia's war of aggression and to hold those responsible to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> We will continue to work closely with our partners to combat harmful Russian disinformation narratives. Together with the European Union and its member states, Ireland has introduced a series of sanctions which target state-owned media services responsible for Russian state propaganda. We will continue to work together to combat Russian disinformation and increase our resilience against such hybrid threats.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Russia has repeatedly sought to mask the human cost of its unprovoked war on Ukraine with baseless and unfounded claims against Ukraine and the United States. At the Security Council, we have called out Russian attempts to distort reality, particularly in relation to the illegal attack on the hospital in Mariupol and their false claims of Ukrainian chemical and biological weapons programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Since Russia's full-scale onslaught in Ukraine on 24 February, Russian police have systematically and often violently repressed opposition to the war within Russia. More than 15,000 peaceful protesters have so far been arrested.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Russian Parliament has introduced a series of legal provisions whereby anyone questioning the so-called "special military operation", may be subject to prosecution and jail, in some cases up to 15 years imprisonment. Dissent and opposition are the hallmark of our sustainable democratic model, and its criminalisation is of deep concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> As a result, much of Russia's independent media have suspended activities, resulting in a state monopoly on information. At least 150 journalists have fled Russia since 24 February. Worryingly, independent journalists who remain have been labelled by the Russian authorities as "foreign agents" and may be held liable, prosecuted and imprisoned should they be critical of Russia's actions in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Ireland calls on the Russian Government to meet and respect fully its international human rights obligations, including by ensuring the safety and welfare of independent media, journalists and civil society actors and promoting access to a free, diverse and pluralistic media.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> We will continue to use our membership of the UN Security Council to hold Russia accountable and to urge it to end its war of aggression in Ukraine as soon as possible. Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace and we will continue to demand accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> There are many other countries where journalists and press freedom are under attack. I know that Deputies have a close interest in this issue, not only in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also in relation to many other countries across virtually every region of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge and thank the many Oireachtas Members who, through overseas visits and international meetings, are actively engaged in raising issues of press freedom with their interlocutors when they travel. Our place on the Security Council, our Presidency of the Council of Europe and our membership of the European Union have been central to our efforts to protect media freedom. If, in due course, we are elected to the Human Rights Council for the 2027 – 2029 period, we will build further on our work in support of media freedom, protecting journalists covering conflicts and calling for accountability for crimes against journalists. I look forward to the outcome of our discussions here today so that we can redouble our efforts on behalf of journalists and press freedom around the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">It is important that we acknowledge here today that at a time when the world is being assailed with campaigns of misinformation, where technology has been appropriated as a tool of hybrid warfare, that the role of journalism has never been more important. It is this role, which often provides the sole counterpoint to the increasing instances of fabricated self-serving narratives of powerful leaders and states corrupted with ambition, which provides an intrinsic defence of justice itself. With the weaponisation of narrative, those who seek to illuminate the truth to project it for a global audience become the target of autocrats and criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Between 1992 and 2022, 923 journalists have been reported as murdered across the globe as a result of their work. Last year alone witnessed the deaths of at least 50 journalists, with 302 imprisoned, including Mr. Julian Assange. Since Russia launched its bloody invasion of Ukraine in February, at least 23 journalists have been killed there, including the Irish journalist, Mr. Pierre Zakrzewski. We remember Pierre and the other journalists who have died, including Irish journalists Lyra McKee and Martin O'Hagan here in Ireland. I also want to mention the courage and the bravery of those journalists who remain on the ground in the war zone in Ukraine, working tirelessly to uncover the truth of what is being visited upon ordinary people, often amidst dangerous and horrific conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> On 11 May, just short of two weeks ago, Israeli forces carried out the execution of the veteran American-Palestinian journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh. Shireen was shot in the face by an Israeli military sniper, despite the fact that she was wearing a blue vest, clearly identifying her as a member of the press. Her colleague, who was wounded in the attack, remained under sustained gunfire from Israeli forces for some time after the death of Shireen. Shireen was shot to silence her voice, a voice that fearlessly reported on the oppression and harassment visited upon the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupation authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The motivation behind the attack on Shireen is similar to the motivation behind the decision by the Israeli authorities to designate the six internationally respected Palestinian human rights non-government organisations, NGOs, as terror entities last year. Earlier this week, we witnessed the Israeli apartheid regime refuse entry to an EU delegation to the occupied Palestinian territories. This delegation also consisted of two Irish MEPs, one of which is my party colleague, Mr. Chris MacManus. Israel also consistently refuses to allow the entry of the UN special rapporteur or UN human rights committee members into the occupied Palestinian territories. Israel wants to silence the civic voice of Palestine. It wants to suppress the truth of its apartheid policies. It does not want the world to hear of its crimes and it wants to continue with its campaign of the illegal annexation of Palestinian territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The Israeli High Court has just ruled that the largest expulsion and forced transfer of Palestinians to take place since the beginning of the Israeli military occupation of Palestine in 1967 can go ahead. That could commence any day now. If allowed to go ahead, this would mean the forced eviction of over 1,000 Palestinians, including 500 children. The UN and international, Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations have called this another grave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a possible war crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> I take this opportunity to echo the calls of the Palestinian Authority for the International Criminal Court to conduct an investigation into the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh as a war crime. I ask that the Government and the Minister would actively support and move on this demand. Furthermore, the Government and the Minister should use Ireland’s position on the UN Security Council and in the EU to call for Israel to be held accountable for Shireen's murder. For far too long the international community has been allowed off the hook and it has been allowed to look the other way while these crimes continue. There is a moral onus on global leaders and governments to act once and for all and to hold Israel to account for its inhumane treatment of the Palestinian people.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> The failure to act to date has merely emboldened the Israeli state, leading to greater and greater levels of oppression to the point where it now feels confident enough to murder an internationally renowned journalist in cold blood in front of cameras. I found it remarkable, albeit predictable, to listen to the Israeli response in the immediate aftermath of the murder. I could almost hear the voice of General Mike Jackson, the former head of the British army, and the chief and first apologist on the ground for the parachute regiment of the British army in the immediate aftermath of the Ballymurphy massacre and Bloody Sunday. The disgraceful attempt by the Israelis to hijack and obscure the truth, to introduce doubt and confusion, though reprehensible, was entirely predictable. The truth, however, is not that easily concealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The Israelis took another page out of the British doctrine on counter-insurgency in Ireland when they attacked the funeral of Shireen, beating mourners mercilessly as they attempted to seize the Palestinian flag from the coffin. This is a picture that was all too common in the North during the 1980s as the British state sought through its agents in the Royal Ulster Constabulary to terrorise the nationalist population into defeat. It did not work in the North and it certainly will not work in Palestine. If international law is to mean anything, and it must, there absolutely needs to be a full and independent investigation into the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I will end with a question to the Government. What is this Government going to do to hold this brutal, apartheid regime to account for its continual flouting of international law? Words are welcome but actions mean everything.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">The response of the Israeli state after the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh was consistent with its response to all sorts of similar events over the years. We have seen the imagery of the young man in the white t-shirt showing heroism under gunfire from Israeli snipers in rescuing her body. Those images do not lie and it is very clear what happened here. There must be an independent investigation and I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brady, that the International Criminal Court will have to look at it. It has all the hallmarks of an appalling war crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> If that was not bad enough, the imagery from the funeral horrified people across the world. Even in death, they could not allow her dignity or her mourners dignity to bury her in peace. It was absolutely disgusting. This is typical of a regime that is unchallenged and allowed to do as it wants by the international community, including our Government. We cannot even pass a resolution banning the products of illegal settlements, which are defined as war crimes under international law. We do commerce with people involved with war crimes. We cannot even pass legislation on that. We cannot recognise the state of Palestine, despite both Houses asking that we do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> This has led to the actions of the Israeli police force. It is unchallenged internationally and feels it can do anything it wants. Of course, there is also imagery of illegal settlers taking possession of a building in Hebron as the mourners were at the funeral. I do not know what more we can say. I have stood here so many times, as have my colleagues, to speak after witnessing such actions from the Israeli state. B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the UN rapporteur have defined what goes on as apartheid and repugnant to international law but the Government cannot even describe it as apartheid because it is hamstrung with an utterly failed European Union policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> We must speak for ourselves, as we did when South Africa was engaged in apartheid. We took a stand proudly against that regime in the 1980s but will we do it again? Will we have an independent foreign policy that stands up to horrific actions such as those we have seen? The Minister should reflect on that and do the right thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">Over the past few decades we have seen the crucial role played by journalists in conflict zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">They constantly put themselves in harm's way to report the facts on the ground. They do not merely accept the narrative put out in a military or government press release but seek the truth at source to broadcast to the world. In Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1980s, journalists helped to expose the worst crimes of government death squads. There are countless examples from Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan and now Ukraine where brave committed and outspoken journalists have exposed the brutality of war at great personal risk. These are journalists such as Pierre Zakrzewski, a talented war zone photographer who reported on conflicts from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Ukraine. He was brutally murdered by Russian shelling not far from the capital of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Two weeks ago, Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was executed by the Israeli occupation forces. Her assassination was clear and deliberate. It is getting more and more frustrating that almost weekly we hear members of various political parties expressing their condemnation of Israeli terror and land grabs. We have condemnation after condemnation but no consequences. This is a huge issue. It is a flaw in the Government's policy. There are never consequences for Israeli crimes. If the Minister were walking down Kildare Street and saw an individual being beaten to death, he would intervene and there would be consequences for the person carrying out that brutal assault. An international equivalent of this is that Israel is beating Palestine to death. It is robbing its land. It is stealing the land and the Minister knows this. He has seen it first-hand.</p>

There are no consequences because the Government is not willing to stand up to Europe and the Israelis and face them down and state we will pass the occupied territories Bill. There have to be consequences for Israeli terror. This is not what the Government is about. The Government is about appeasing Israel. This is something we have to address. When will the Government go beyond condemnation and ensure there are consequences for Israel? Will it outline what consequences there are for Israel for executing people, stealing land and arresting people and detaining them on administrative detention? Will the Minister tell me what are the consequences because I can see none.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">The murder of reporter Shireen Abu Akleh by the Israeli military must be condemned in the strongest terms and called out for what it is, namely, cold-blooded murder. Her murder was barbaric and there are no other words for it. She was present at a raid by Israeli forces at a Palestinian refugee camp wearing a clearly visible blue flak jacket that identified her as a journalist when she was brutally murdered. She was shot in the face and another journalist was shot in the back. Israeli forces claim they came under attack but journalists who were present have said this is categorically not true. The whole world knows this and that Israeli forces were shooting journalists to kill.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> The scenes at her funeral were outrageous and disgusting and should never have been allowed to happen. Israeli forces are so brazen that they attacked the pall-bearers at the funeral, in full view of the world, in the full knowledge they would never be held to account for this act or any other act of violence against Palestinian people. Their blatant lies about the circumstances of her death and the attacks at her funeral were reminiscent of how the RUC treated republicans in the North. We have left that behind us, thankfully, but this barbarism continues in Palestine in 2022. The Israeli state carried out this murder as part of its ongoing efforts to eradicate all reporting of its human rights abuses against the Palestinian people. We all know about its propaganda machine. Truly, it is something else. Preventing reporting of its actions in Palestine is part of this, even if it means cold-blooded murder. Civilised nations should never accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The question needs to be asked why world leaders turn a blind eye. It is because Israel is bankrolled and supported by the United States. The Irish Government should use our position on the UN Security Council and our position in the EU to demand that the international community take action to bring an end to the outrageous human rights abuses Israel continues to perpetrate against the Palestinian people. As my colleagues have said, what happened to Shireen Abu Akleh needs to be investigated by the International Criminal Court as a potential war crime. What is the point of our seat on the UN Security Council if we are not going to speak up and request that real action be taken this time and hold states such as Israel to account? The policy of forced displacement of Palestinians continues to this day. Israel’s disregard for international law continues and the rest of the world gives it a free hand to do so. It is time world leaders and the international community took action against Israel and its terrorist acts.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">George Orwell famously said that in times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act. I was reminded of this when I saw the cold-blooded murder of Shireen Abu Akleh. The European Union said in a statement that it strongly condemns the killing, occurring as it did just days after world press freedom day. This was an absolute travesty. It reminds me of another ongoing travesty, which is Julian Assange's continued imprisonment in Belmarsh prison. The UN special rapporteur on torture described his treatment as prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma. Shireen and Julian were two revolutionary truth tellers who spoke truth to power. Those in positions of power, whether the Israeli forces or their US counterparts, cannot allow this to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> From all sides of the House I have rightly heard criticism of the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh. We are united in our horror at Israel's actions. We must now be united in our holding of apartheid Israel to account for its actions. Israel is ignoring our cries and it is now on us to do everything in our power to mount international pressure on Israel so it can no longer ignore international condemnation. The late great war correspondent Robert Fisk once said the job of journalists is to be witnesses to history, not to worry about themselves and to try to get as near as possible in an imperfect world to the truth and get the truth out. We must stand with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">The Palestinian Authority has described the murder of Shireen as an execution and it is difficult to argue with this conclusion. She was one of four journalists in a car, each clearly wearing a blue flak jacket and helmet identifying them as journalists. They were fired upon by Israeli forces without the slightest provocation. This attack is part of an ongoing attempt by the Israelis to obscure the truth and reality of its occupation of the Palestinian territories. This is a war crime and it should be investigated as such. I join the Minister today in condemnation of the attack but condemnation without consequence is absolutely futile. The Russian violence towards Ukraine has led to sanctions being imposed, but on the other hand Israel acts with impunity. The eyes of the world were on Shireen's funeral but Israeli forces still attacked it. Why was that? It was because Israel knew there would be no consequences for its actions. This has to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> In 2019, when I was mayor of South Dublin County Council I opened a book of condolences for the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. I remember how deeply her senseless murder affected me. Lyra will be remembered as an exceptionally talented journalist, an advocate with a deep sense of social justice and a campaigner for equal rights. Those who brutally took her life are in complete contrast to how Lyra lived. As a nation we strive for a peaceful future that has no place for violence. Those who took Lyra's life have no place in our society.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I want to use this opportunity to express my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Pierre Zakrzewski on his awful killing in Ukraine. I want to reference the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh in Palestine. The murder of Shireen makes me fearful.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Whatever Israel gets away with, it always goes further. The Minister referred to the recent attempt by a European Parliament delegation to enter Israel and Palestine. In 2014, following the most recent bombardment of the Gaza Strip at that time, I was part of a European Parliament delegation that sought access into Gaza, access which was denied by Israel. Of course, further bombardments and worse atrocities followed. This week, we saw that Israel now feels it has the authority and ability to essentially deny an entire official European Parliament delegation access to Palestine. That speaks to what happens when Israel gets away with something; it always goes further. Therefore, I am very fearful of what is in store for the Palestinian people. It is getting to the point when people rightly ask how much further these guys can go. Israel has now, in front of the world's media, murdered a journalist in cold blood.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> I want to put on the record my appreciation of the strong language the Minister used today and has used on a number of occasions in respect of Israel. I again relay my own experience in the European Parliament. I know his use of the language to describe the actions of Israel is among a minority among EU foreign ministers. It is something I deeply regret. In many European states, the Israeli lobby and the misguided policy of appeasing Israel is the order of the day. We cannot allow that majority, as it may be, within EU foreign ministers to prevent us from speaking on behalf of the majority of humanity across the world. The Minister's words must be followed by strong actions on behalf of the Irish people and I urge him to heed the calls heard today.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I am truly happy to have the opportunity to speak on a very important debate on the role of journalists in conflict. The saying that truth is the first casualty of war has always reflected reality. Winning the propaganda war is generally considered almost as important as progress on the battlefield in any conflict. That is particularly true of holding on to home support for the actions of government and agents of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Let us look no further than the narrative of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, which is peddled daily by Putin and his echo chambers across the world, that there is no war, just a special military operation, and no imperial ambition of conquest, just a campaign to denazify. Joseph Goebbels said that the bigger the lie, the more it will be believed. I am afraid there is more than just a semblance of truth to that statement. At a time when news is instant and even visual evidence can be easily manufactured, the importance of the impartial voice and eye is critical to our understanding, causes and outcome of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Free journalists with free access are our best shield against the big lie. One journalist with such an eye and voice was Shireen Abu Akleh. A Palestinian witness to truth, respected across the journalistic world, Shireen was a household name throughout the Arab world as she reflected the daily life and experiences of Palestinians under Israeli rule, for her network Al Jazeera. Shireen Abu Akleh was shot in the head on 11 May as she did her work as a journalist, reporting on a raid of the West Bank city of Jenin by Israeli defence forces. Her employer, the much respected Al Jazeera network, called it a blatant murder, a heinous crime that intends to prevent the media from conducting its duty. There must be an independent thorough investigation of this shocking and disgraceful act. No civilised nation should seek to impede full accountability for this obvious public act of violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The disgraceful scenes at Shireen's funeral, when Israeli military personnel attacked the funeral procession, kicking and hitting mourners with batons, was the final act of disrespect, as well as an act that clearly showed they believed they acted with complete impunity. A journalist doing her job, clearly wearing a helmet, wearing body armour with the word "PRESS", was shot dead. It was an assault on all journalists and all who try, in the most difficult of places and the most difficult of places, to ensure the truth is made known to the world. It falls to us to take up Shireen Abu Akleh's mission by ensuring that her final story is told truthfully and that those responsible for her death are brought to justice. As an aside, I hope the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, which will pertain in this jurisdiction to those in any way associated with acts of human rights violation, will be enacted by the Oireachtas in this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Various different versions of what is said to have happened have come out since 11 May, provided by many spokespersons for the Israeli defence forces. That must end. Investigators who are clearly impartial must be allowed to bring the truth into the public domain with rigorous and impartial analysis of the facts. They must now be allowed to set about this work. Journalists in every conflict zone put their lives at risk so that the rest of us might get the real picture of unfolding events. Democratic governments and parliaments must afford those journalists doing that job the best protection they can in carrying out this most difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I began by saying that the truth is often the first casualty of war. The capacity to disseminate information was never greater than it is today. Every person with a mobile phone is a potential publisher, film maker and film distributor. In a potential and actual sea of information and data, how do we as individuals and communities determine what is true and what is not? The responsibility of social media platforms to be accountable for the content they distribute is a matter that is under debate in this Parliament, the European Parliament and across the free world. Democratic nations should not franchise this responsibility to commercial actors. The recent debate about the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk and his view of providing an unregulated, or at least a loosely regulated, media platform brings additional focus on this matter. It is not acceptable that such an important function could be given to an individual who has simply amassed sufficient wealth to buy a hugely impactive mechanism for communication. I know individual nations are limited in what they can do to control such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The notion that in the final instance it would be a matter for any wealthy individual to determine what is presented to the world as truth is clearly unacceptable. Most people now turn to trusted sources, and ultimately, to trusted journalists, as the only way of ensuring the information they access is accurate, true and fair. Many previous speakers have instanced the work of journalists and Irish journalists, and their support teams, including cameramen and sound people who travel with them. They have not only put themselves in harm's way, but have actually died bringing us the truth. They need our protection and support. When there is a blatant assault on a journalist, we need to be united and clear in our condemnation of that, but we must have some international mechanism to bring authorities who commit or permit such atrocities to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I welcome the very strong series of statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House today. However, we need to go beyond that, and have a mechanism where the civilised world can act in unison against acts that undermine the capacity of all of us to hear and see the truth. I recall, many years ago, reading Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's<i> One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i>. Solzhenitsyn was an individual who suffered greatly. He was sent to the Soviet Gulags. He was fixated by the truth, and how the truth was perverted in Soviet Russia. Unfortunately, the truth is still being undermined and perverted in the current Russia. He said: "The simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie". Our job is to ensure we do not condone the lie, accept it, or allow it to remain on the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">Ireland has responded in an open and generous way to the people fleeing the war in Ukraine. In three months, the State has provided accommodation to 23,000 people fleeing the war. Private citizens have accommodated thousands more, and communities across the country have stepped up to the plate in welcoming Ukrainians and helping them to settle in. We would not have had this response were it not for the work of journalists who have communicated the horror of the war so effectively. They are journalists who, on a daily basis, put their lives at risk for the sake of truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The initiation of war in any context is immoral, unjustified and reckless, but this is especially true in the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The UN has estimated that almost 4,000 civilians have been killed to date. Over nine journalists have lost their lives. I want to pay tribute to all journalists who put their lives at risk to let the world know what is happening in this war. Today, I want to mention, in particular, our own Pierre Zakrzewski. Pierre and his colleague, Oleksandra Kuvshynova, lost their lives in March 2022, when their team and others came under fire outside Kyiv. Pierre has done a particular service to the cause of truth, with a distinguished career covering war in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Today, I also acknowledge the work of another journalist working in a conflict zone, Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot dead earlier this month while wearing a blue vest with "PRESS" written on it as she covered a raid by the Israeli defence forces on a refugee camp in Jenin in occupied Palestinian territory. Shireen Abu Akleh was one of the most prominent Palestinian journalists, if not the most prominent. Over 25 years, she covered the injustice of the occupation so effectively and gave the ordinary Palestinian a voice. The circumstances of her death demand an immediate, impartial, independent and effective investigation. We also saw the circumstances surrounding her funeral. It is impossible not to take it out of the context of the occupation. We must ask ourselves what kind of circumstances allow a police force to charge and beat the mourners at a funeral, to the point where the pallbearers lose their grip on the coffin. The circumstances are, of course, unusual. They are the circumstances of a cruel, prolonged and stifling occupation, where the Israeli defence forces, the police force and the Israeli Government have for too long operated in an environment of impunity. </p>
          <p eId="para_268"> I lived and worked in occupied Palestinian territory for three months as a human rights observer. With the movement restrictions; the permit system; the layers of security at checkpoints; the random arrest and torture of people, sometimes children; the demolition of homes; the growth in illegal settlements; the administrative detention in prison; the random beatings; the humiliations; the unlawful killings; and the unlawful killings with no hint of an investigation or a consequence, it is one of the most elaborate and cruel systems of oppression in operation in the world today. It is people like Shireen Abu Akleh who did and do they best they can to portray the reality, inhumanity and cruelty of the occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Many organisations working on the ground in occupied Palestinian territory are also trying to bring the truth to the world. In March 2022 I returned to the West Bank because NGOs working on the ground are finding it an increasingly difficult space to operate in. The documentation and challenging of the range of human rights abuses is increasingly coming under pressure from the Israeli Government. Last October, Israel unjustifiably designated six such NGOs as terrorist organisations. Two of these organisations are supported, and continue to be supported, by the Irish Government. I was glad to meet with representatives of the organisations in Palestine and to publicly offer my support for their work. I wish to take this opportunity to call on the EU to reinstate the funding of the six organisations after it was withdrawn following the Israeli designation. </p>
          <p eId="para_270"> I want to briefly refer to the work of the two organisations in question, which are supported by the Irish Government. Al-Haq is a leading Palestinian human rights organisation that focuses on the documentation of human rights and international humanitarian law violations and, via the publication of studies and reports, undertakes advocacy work at local and international levels. Addameer documents human rights violations, conducts regular prison visits, offers counselling and guidance and engages in advocacy to oppose torture and arbitrary detention, particularly at an international level. Special attention is paid to women and child prisoners. Indeed, Ireland’s human rights and democracy programme in the region is offering crucial support to a number of other NGOs working on the ground in Palestine that are challenging and bringing to light the unacceptable human rights situation and promoting democracy. I commend the work of all NGOs that document and highlight the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and particularly commend the groundbreaking work of B’Tselem and Amnesty International.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> To conclude, the role of journalists in conflict zones is crucial one. We must do everything we can to protect journalists. Part of this is ensuring and pressing for accountability when they are restricted from doing their job or killed.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">I think it is entirely appropriate that every so often, as parliamentarians in a democracy, we set aside time to consider the role of journalists in wars and conflicts across the world, and to remember those journalists, reporters, cameramen and all those involved in the media who have been killed in circumstances related to their work. As we know, the first casualty of war is the truth. We rely on the bravery of journalists, often risking their lives, to tell us the truth about what is actually happening on the ground. It is reported that this year alone, some 27 journalists have been killed. Some have died in war zones. Others have been killed, kidnapped, tortured or imprisoned because they have reported on the activities of the ruling authoritarian regimes, while others have been caught up in the warring factions in failed states. Like others, today I would like to remember some of the journalists who have paid the ultimate price.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Shireen Abu Akleh was a Palestinian journalist who was shot in the head by Israeli forces in the West Bank. Aged 51, she regularly exposed herself to danger in order to report on the issues of concern to Palestinians. When she was shot, it was clear that she was a journalist, in that she had the word "PRESS" displayed on her jacket and helmet. The circumstances of her death need to be independently investigated. I fully support the calls by the EU and the UN Security Council for this to be done. There are indications that Israel is targeting Palestinian journalists working in the occupied Palestinian territories. This cannot be tolerated by the international community. The incidents which took place at the funeral of Shireen Abu Akleh, where Israeli police baton-charged the mourners carrying her coffin, were shocking and deeply offensive to decent people everywhere. </p>
          <p eId="para_274"> We also remember Pierre Zakrzewski, the French-Irish citizen, who worked as a cameraman for Fox News and died with his colleague when his car was hit by Russian shelling outside Kyiv on 14 March last. We salute his bravery and that of the other journalists killed in Ukraine and thank them and their families and friends for the service they have given to democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I also draw attention to the plight of political prisoners jailed by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, some of whom have died in captivity due to their ill-treatment. I also refer to the violation by the Moroccan authorities of the rights of pro-independence Sahrawi activists, including journalists, in Western Sahara.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> We can never be complacent about the survival of democracy and the threat posed by autocratic regimes. Media pluralism and freedom of the press are so important for our democracy in the context of the rule of law. They need to be safeguarded and protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> It is entirely appropriate that we have this debate here as we need to remember these brave journalists. We have only had the opportunity to mention a few but they are representative of the profession in general. We cannot be complacent about our democracy. Journalists play a crucial role in that. Even within the European Union, the rule of law must be upheld. I have no doubt that member states will ensure that is done in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I join my colleague in welcoming this discussion on the vital role of journalists in conflicts across the world. At the outset I pay tribute to the many very brave journalists and photojournalists who report and inform us from the many dangerous conflict zones around the globe. They carry out an indispensable and invaluable role. It is important that we stand in solidarity with journalists and continue to support their fundamental work. We must never take for granted the crucial role played by journalists, media workers and the free and independent media.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> At least seven journalists covering the war in Ukraine have been killed. There are ongoing investigations into the deaths of seven other journalists to determine if their deaths were work-related. One of those lost was Pierre Zakrzewski from Leopardstown in south Dublin. Most recently, on 11 May, there was the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin which must also be condemned. I welcome the Government’s call for a swift, thorough, and independent investigation. Her death and the subsequent appalling scenes at her funeral were disgraceful and cannot be ignored by the international community. </p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I understand An Garda Síochána is assisting its French colleagues in an investigation into the death in Ukraine of journalist Pierre Zakrzewski. Mr. Zakrzewski, who was 55 years of age and from Leopardstown, was killed when the car he was travelling in was hit by Russian shelling outside Kyiv on 14 March. He was working as a cameraman for the American channel Fox News. Two of his colleagues were also killed and injured. Mr. Zakrzewski held both Irish and French citizenship. The investigation into his death is being led by the French authorities with An Garda Síochána providing a supporting role. For now, this support is likely to be confined to the sharing of documents, including those related to the post mortem. Unlike in Ireland, French authorities have the power to investigate and prosecute the deaths of its citizens abroad. The French investigation is being led by the national counterterrorism prosecutor’s office, known as PNAT, and the central office for the fight against crimes against humanity, genocides and war crimes, which is a division of the French national police. Mr. Zakrzewski was born to a French mother and a Polish father and grew up in south Dublin, where he attended St. Conleth’s College and UCD. He was married to Michelle, a former BBC journalist, and covered conflicts in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I wish to offer my condolences to Michelle and the extended Zakrzewski family.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, which is an independent, non-profit organisation that promotes press freedom worldwide, at least seven journalists covering the war in Ukraine have been killed. The CPJ is investigating the deaths of seven other journalists. Scores more have faced shelling, shooting and detention as they work to provide vital information about the invasion. It should also be noted that Russian journalists have been detained and threatened during Moscow’s crackdown on independent Russian media and many have fled the country. All states, not just Russia, must uphold basic standards to protect the standards of journalism and the safety of journalists while they carry out their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are raised regularly with me by constituents. On that note, I welcome students from Cabinteely Community School and their teacher, Mr. David Traynor, to the Dáil today. It should be noted that Ireland has been ranked sixth in a new press freedom index published by Reporters without Borders. While this is welcome, it is important that we redouble our efforts here in Ireland and use our influence abroad to continue to support the work of journalists and photojournalists.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I would like to express my condolences to the family and colleagues of Shireen Abu Akleh who was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank earlier this month. She was shot in the face by an Israeli soldier because of the job she was doing in shining a spotlight on the genocidal actions of Israel. The Israeli spin machine started immediately. Israel’s Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, has lied. Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, has lied and the Israeli army has lied. Bennett said that the Palestinians did it. Lapid said that Israel wants to help the Palestinians get to the truth. The same Lapid once said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_284">We need to get the Palestinians out of our lives. What we have to do is build a high wall and get them out of our sight.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Israeli army said its soldiers do not target journalists. Apparently, the 16 Palestinian journalists who have perished over the last 30 years were unlucky. We need to remember that they were not targets but were unfortunate. We saw the disgraceful behaviour by the Israeli army at Shireen Abu Akleh's funeral. It was reminiscent of the North of Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. It was behaviour designed to remind the Palestinian people of their place. Surely Israel can see that its actions are provoking a violent reaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> I would also like to express my condolences to the families of Irish cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and his Ukrainian colleague Oleksandra Kuvshynova who were killed in Kyiv in March. Journalists are often referred to as the fourth estate. They help us to see through the propaganda of war and to see the actions of warmongering nations. The international community continues to talk out of both sides of its mouth. One person’s aggressor is another’s friendly nation. Most ordinary people see through this. There must be an independent investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> The Israeli Government’s attitude is in total contrast to that of the Ukrainian Government, which yesterday sentenced a Russian soldier to life for the murder of a civilian. The message we should be sending to rogue states is that there must be consequences. Instead, we have the likes of Israel and Britain, whose soldiers act with impunity. I refer to soldiers like lance corporal David James Cleary, better known as soldier F, who is accused of murdering civilians on Bloody Sunday. The families of these civilians are waiting over 50 years for justice. Britain must have used up the alphabet at this stage with soldiers hiding behind letters. It is almost four years since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and still there is no justice for his family. There must be consequences, it must happen, and the truth must be protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">I want first to offer my sincere condolences to the families, friends and co-workers of Shireen Abu Akleh. We know in this House that the Israeli Government and its so-called defence forces are no strangers to hiding the truth of the cruel and inhumane crimes that they perpetrate upon the Palestinian people on a daily basis. They have executed a Palestinian reporter for Al Jazeera for factually reporting news of a raid by Israeli forces on the Jenin refugee camp. It is simply wrong. This level of aggression towards a clearly identified journalist who was travelling together with other journalists - they were wearing the internationally known blue helmets and flak jackets - is simply a war crime. The international community must call on Israel to be held to account for its actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> Shireen Abu Akleh was shot execution-style with a single bullet to the face which Al Jazeera claims was fired by an Israeli sniper. Given the circumstances, this is hard to argue against. This was not an unfortunate journalist who died while reporting from a war zone and was tragically killed in the crossfire from both sides of a conflict. It was murder at the hands of the Israeli regime. She was clearly identifiable and identified as a journalist. Yet again, Israel has shown its oppressive nature and its disregard for human life. Action must be taken and taken now. The people of Palestine and indeed those in other areas of the world suffering through occupation and war must wish those oppressing them were treated in the same manner as the Russian people and its government in the war in Ukraine. </p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Government must use its position on the UN Security Council to bring about sanctions on the Israeli defence force, IDF. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, needs to offer more than empty rhetoric.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_291">George Orwell is said to have written, "In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act." Shireen Abu Akleh was murdered by the forces of the Israeli state precisely because she committed her life to sharing the horrific truths of Israel's cruel treatment of the Palestinian people. She was wearing a bright blue vest marked "Press" and was standing with other journalists when she was killed. Journalists present on the scene have since reported that as Shireen Abu Akleh and her colleagues were gathering to report on the operations of the Israeli forces, there were no Palestinian militants or fighters present and no skirmishes ongoing at that time. As she was felled by the accurate bullet of an Israeli sniper, Shireen Abu Akleh became the 16th Palestinian journalist to have been targeted by the Israeli forces in this manner since 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> To compound the killing of a person who was a danger to their forces only in her attempt to tell the truth, the Israeli army and Government then initiated a lie, namely, that Shireen was killed by the wayward bullet of a Palestinian militant. When this was proven to be a lie, in no small part due to the testimony of other journalists, one of whom also was targeted that day, and the work of the Israeli human rights organisations that traced video evidence, the Israeli Government asserted that it does not target journalists. Sixteen dead Palestinian journalists and the fact the same army bombed the media offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press in Gaza only last year make this statement very hard to believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> In our discussion today, it is appropriate that we acknowledge and condemn the deliberate and targeted killing of journalists throughout the world, wherever it occurs. So far in 2022, 28 journalists have been killed while carrying out their work, the highest number of whom, nine, were killed in Mexico. An increasing number are being viciously targeted by the forces of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. It would be untrue to suggest that Irish people did not look with particular revulsion at the slaying of Ms Abu Akleh, and the subsequent assault on those who carried her coffin in the days that followed, and ask what we can do to hold those responsible for this atrocity to account. We simply must end the cycle of impunity for those who target journalists for seeking to tell the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Last week, when Opposition Members sought this debate to condemn the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Taoiseach rightfully proposed including the slaying of all journalists in conflict zones and made specific reference to the Irish journalist, Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed while reporting on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Taoiseach was right to make this inclusion but, in doing so, he highlighted the hypocrisy in the response by Ireland and the European Union to such atrocities when applied to the state of Israel as opposed to the response to the horrors of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In the case of the latter, we very swiftly engaged in a system of boycotts of Russia, issued sanctions and divested Russian investments. The Palestinian people would be right in asking why they are not afforded the same standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Ireland, Europe and some quarters of the United States undoubtedly have condemned the deplorable killing of Ms Abu Akleh and the immoral actions of the Israeli forces in baton-charging mourners at her funeral. Time and again, however, we have witnessed that the Israeli Government and army care not one iota for our condemnation. The time is surely arriving to turn our backs on the actions of a state that meets all the criteria under international law for inflicting a system of apartheid on the people of Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> There simply must be consequences for those who target journalists, whether in conflict zones or elsewhere. Scott Griffen, deputy director of the International Press Institute, wrote yesterday that the most important thing that can be done in cases targeting media in violent acts is accountability. He went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_297">It sounds very simple but it isn't - we know that in at least 90% of cases in which journalists are murdered, those responsible are not held to account. The failure to respond quickly to attacks on journalists and to hold those responsible for the initial attacks creates what we call a cycle of violence, a cycle of impunity where those responsible feel that they can act without consequences, and we see it as an open invitation to attack journalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Someone who attacked a building last year may go on to attack a journalist 12 months later. Mr. Griffen's colleague, Pauline Adès-Mével, agreed that ending impunity is crucial to ending the killing of journalists. She said: "If there is no judicial response, the number of killings will continue to grow and grow and grow."</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> In his previous contribution, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined the steps he thinks the Israeli authorities must take to bring those responsible for the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh to justice. What does he intend to do if the Government's call once again falls upon deaf ears? Do we simply add the deliberate killing and targeting of journalists to the list of injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people that we are willing to condemn but not to act upon? In this Chamber today, we are paying honour to those who lost their lives in order to speak the truth. In doing so, I implore the Minister to pay the fullest honour to them and to describe the actions of the Israeli state as what they are, in the most truthful terms, that is, as constituting the crime of apartheid. Whether something is apartheid is not about phraseology; its definition is enshrined in international law and Israel is meeting the relevant conditions. The most truthful thing we can do is call that out. Apartheid has no place in the world. States that choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I turn briefly to the issues being faced by journalists in Western Sahara. The Moroccan authorities continue to violate the rights of pro-independence Sahrawi activists through ill treatment, arrests and harassment. Amnesty International reported that in May 2020, Sahrawi journalist and human rights activist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was arrested in Laâyoune, Western Sahara, and detained for more than two days. Three security officers interrogated him about his work for the Sahrawi human rights organisation, the Nushatta Foundation, and repeatedly beat and assaulted him. They forced him to sign a confession to trumped-up charges of throwing stones at police officers in April that year. Two days later, he was charged with breaking orders relating to the health emergency status and to offending public officials under Article 263 of the country's penal code. His trial opened on 18 November but was postponed to an unknown date, as reported in the Amnesty International Report of 2020-21: The State of the World's Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Amnesty International also reported that in May 2021, the authorities arrested Essabi Yahdih, a Sahrawi journalist and director of an online media company, Algargarat Media, at his workplace in Western Sahara. They interrogated him about his journalistic work and accused him of filming military barracks in Dakhla, a city in Western Sahara. On 29 July, he was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine. In prison in Dakhla, he was denied medical attention for pre-existing hearing and sight conditions, as reported in the Amnesty International report to which I referred. Human Rights Watch has reported harassment of journalists such as Nazha El-Khalidi, who was arrested twice simply for reporting on Sahrawi protests against Moroccan human rights abuses. Morocco has been using the Israeli spyware, Pegaus, to spy on journalists. These abuses against journalists are part of a wider pattern of human rights abuses and repression by Morocco directed against Sahrawi activists, such as the treatment of Sultana Khaya who, Front Line Defenders report, has been repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted by the authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, is in place in occupied Western Sahara but it does not currently have a human rights observation mandate. While the political solutions for the referendum on self-determination remain deadlocked, it is essential that MINURSO be given that mandate. Until recently, the Irish Army provided two officers to MINURSO but they have since been withdrawn. It is a pity this was done at a time when we could use our UN Security Council seat to implore MINURSO to protect human rights in the Western Sahara region. When the MINURSO mandate comes before the Security Council in October, it is essential that we use our voice on the council to push for a human rights observation element to be included.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I am grateful to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. Journalists working in conflict situations risk their lives every day. They do so in the name of truth, accuracy, transparency and fair reporting. Sadly, they sometimes pay with the ultimate sacrifice, that is, with their lives. Today, I particularly remember Irish journalist, Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed when his car was hit by Russian shelling outside Kyiv on 14 March, and Shireen Abu Akleh, an Al Jazeera journalist who was shot and killed by Israeli forces while on assignment in the occupied West Bank on 11 May. Pierre and Shireen join a long and shameful list of journalists murdered while doing their job. Across the world, there is a growing threat to press freedom and it must be addressed at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Today, as we all know, marks three months since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. An article in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> yesterday puts the civilian death toll at 4,600, including 232 children. These figures do not include deaths in Russian-occupied territories because we simply do not yet know what horrors have occurred there. We can observe from satellite images and, indeed, continued media coverage that the situation in these occupied areas is catastrophic. In addition, we do not know the number of soldiers and military personnel who have been killed, a large number of whom were civilians a few short months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">However, we know that at least 23 journalists have died during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That number is, sadly, likely only to grow in the coming months, at a time when quality journalism has never been more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> It has often been remarked upon that this war on European soil is unlike others before it. Never before have the media allowed us such a window into a conflict zone, to see and hear from political leaders, community workers and civilians doing their utmost to survive and shed some light on the hell through which they are living. None of this would be possible without the journalists working day in and day out to uncover the truth of what is happening in Ukraine against a backdrop of Russian fake news and disinformation, which continues to be fact-checked, called out and discredited. That is what we need our quality journalists to do. Journalists who remain on the ground are risking their lives and I am very grateful for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> As we know, women journalists are at particular risk, as the Minister remarked earlier. The murders of Lyra McKee and Veronica Guerin highlight the risks that women journalists face on our own shores. They face a disproportionate level of attack and abuse and are especially vulnerable targets when it comes to conflicts, both offline and online. The attacks by Israeli forces at the funeral of Shireen Abu Akleh are a prime example of this. Not even in death was Ms Abu Akleh shown the respect she deserved - respect befitting a world-renowned journalist. I urge the Minister, in every way possible, to ensure the Israeli forces are held accountable for their actions, justice is served and Ireland continues to pull its weight on the world stage in upholding the importance of press protection and freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Before I was elected to this House, I had the opportunity to travel to some conflict zones. I got a very small taste of some of the fear, intimidation and threats that others receive. I found myself in Fiji during a military coup. I was in Kosovo while it built up a brand-new democracy and I was in Palestine during conflict. I stood in the West Bank in places such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah. I crossed the border at Qalandiya and I went through the checkpoint there alone, in the darkness of night. I stood in Hebron during Passover when hundreds of heavily-armed Israeli soldiers burst out of a military zone and took over a Palestinian town. I watched helplessly as those Israeli soldiers banged on the doors of Palestinian homes, forced their way in and illegally occupied these homes to get to their rooftops in order that their snipers could police what was going on below. All of this was simply to watch over a group of tourists visiting a holy site in that town. I counted approximately eight Israeli soldiers for every one of those tourists. I recall standing on a side street in Hebron under a caged roof that was burned through in places by acid thrown down into the settlement. I stood there with my cousin, who worked for an NGO in Palestine at the time and is currently in Syria. We counted seven snipers who were aiming weapons at us, no matter where we walked. The difference between those Israeli soldiers and soldiers I have come across elsewhere in the world is that I knew instinctively they were not there to protect me or the people around me, or to keep the peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Seeing the real-life experiences in other countries ingrained in me a deep respect for our democracy, as well as a deep respect for and admiration of the journalists who fight to protect and uphold it. I welcome that we will continue to use our voice in the EU and on the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the Council of Europe to strongly condemn and call for actions necessary to protect journalists at home and abroad. In a time when news is instant and freedom of speech is threatened on a daily basis, winning the propaganda war has become almost as important as winning the ground war in a conflict. Significant press freedom and responsibility are tied up in the responsibility of social media platforms and their duty to monitor their platforms' content because these go hand in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Globally, we are sadly failing to uphold the reputation of quality journalism by allowing an avalanche of disinformation and harmful opinions to be passed off as freedom of speech or citizen journalism. Social media platforms are, by and large, failing in that way. The recent moves by billionaire, Elon Musk, to acquire Twitter and allow absolute freedom of speech, as he calls it, do not fill me with hope for the future or the future of regulating social media and protecting quality journalism. I am grateful to the many journalists and media personnel who risk their lives in conflicts every day and for the bravery, conviction and advocacy of NGO workers such as my cousin, Brona Higgins, who are on the ground in war zones. Their sacrifice should never be overlooked and the importance of their work should never be underestimated.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">It is vital that we are here to speak about the issue of journalists in conflict zones throughout the world. The recent shooting in the face of a woman journalist in Palestine, Shireen Abu Akleh, has focused our attention on the danger that a great many journalists and others face while being a voice for the voiceless and often exposing the terrible atrocities that happen in many parts of the world. I remember watching film clips from conflicts in different places many years ago. I especially remember the image from Vietnam of a naked child running as he burned with napalm and how that changed America's attitude toward that war. There are many other instances and examples of journalists, cameramen and people at the site of an atrocity being able to bring the message out to the world that it was wrong and things had to change. Thankfully, in some instances, it did change.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> We have all heard and are very much aware of issues such as the examples given by the previous speaker of what she experienced in Palestine, yet how we deal with those examples and the reality for the people who live in Palestine and how we deal with other conflict zones are very different. There is certainly something for the European Union to do in that context. We have to recognise that people who are suffering considerably as a consequence of terror and aggression, be they in Ukraine, Palestine or anywhere else in the world, deserve to have our voice heard strongly for them and to have us stand witness for them. That is what many of these journalists do but we have to back them and be there for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The efforts made by many in this House to try to pursue that sense of dignity and respect for people who find themselves in those circumstances have been found to be singing in the dark, which is unfortunate. Many Deputies, especially on the Opposition benches, have been speaking about issues in Palestine, which does not get the attention it deserves. We know what has been happening in Ukraine, as we can see it very clearly. It is being reported very well, which is excellent and wonderful. We all stand four-square behind the efforts to ensure that Russia's aggression there comes to an end but aggression everywhere has to come to an end. We have to be equally strong in our voice in terms of how we can bring that aggression to an end everywhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">As Deputy Kenny said, the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh as she covered an Israeli raid in the West Bank was a serious violation of international law and potentially a war crime. She was clearly identified as a journalist. She was wearing press insignia but she was targeted by sustained sniper fire, as Members have said. The attempt by the Israeli regime to muddy the waters and claim she had been killed by a Palestinian is typical of its refusal to treat the Palestinian people with dignity and respect. The obscene and violent actions of the Israelis at her funeral are only further testimony to this. This is far from the first time that journalists covering the occupation of Palestine, or other conflicts, have been targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the worst the world has ever seen due to the war waged by Saudi Arabia and its allies. Journalists in Yemen have been detained to stifle coverage of the war and its fallout. Many reports come from Ukraine of journalists being attacked and denied safe passage. A Dublin-based photojournalist was killed when trying to carry out his job in that country. Journalists such as Shireen Abu Akleh are often the only independent observers on the ground in conflict zones besides NGO volunteers. In the absence of the ability to report without fear or favour, the valuable insight into conflict, abuses and dire humanitarian conditions is hidden from us and we are forced to rely on the often biased reports of the belligerents in the conflict. According to the UN Secretary General, "The fundamental role of journalists in ensuring access to reliable information is essential to achieving durable peace, sustainable development and human rights."</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Journalism can be a dangerous profession, not just in far-off conflict zones but even in their home countries. Veronica Guerin, Martin O'Hagan and Lyra McKee all lost their lives in Ireland. The safety of journalists is not an abstract concept but a core principle of international law and it should be respected as such. Campaigns of disinformation have never been as effective or as dangerous as in the modern world. Social media has left us more vulnerable to an information war than ever before. Our best defence is a free press and that is what we should work towards.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">On 14 March, Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irish-Ukrainian journalist, was murdered by Putin's murderous forces in his savage war on Ukraine. In the last week or so, we have seen Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian journalist who spoke out fearlessly for 25 years to try to get across the truth of what is being done to the Palestinian people by the apartheid state of Israel, be murdered in a premeditated fashion. We have seen the utterly shameful scenes of Israeli forces attacking the pallbearers and mourners at her funeral in a premeditated way. Something that has not been mentioned is that they raided the deceased journalist's house a short time after word spread that she had been executed to seize Palestinian flags. It went beyond disrespect for the person they had just executed.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Journalists are murdered by brutal regimes because they want to hide the truth of the crimes those regimes commit, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, oppression, persecution of their enemies and so on, and to silence the truth and criticism. Between 2011 and 2020, 900 journalists were killed worldwide, including 50 last year. It is shameful. We must condemn it as criminal and hold to account those who carry out these crimes against people who are doing us all a service by trying to bring us the truth about war, conflict and the abuse of people by brutal regimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Why is the response different? It is so blatant. When war crimes are committed and journalists are murdered by Putin's regime, it elicits an instantaneous response from the European Union, the United States and our Government, demanding and imposing sanctions, cutting off trade links, arming those who resist Putin's invasion and doing everything else they can. They understandably and legitimately say that it is not acceptable and they must act. However, when a Palestinian journalist, who is the latest in a long line of Palestinian journalists killed, wounded, injured and beaten by the apartheid rogue state of Israel, we get condemnation but no action. Is the life of a Palestinian journalist worth less than the life of a journalist elsewhere? Are the Palestinian people any less deserving of accountability, justice, truth and a response from the international community, our Government and the European Union to a regime that commits crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Palestinian people? They are not, yet the difference is clear. The Government condemned Shireen Abu Akleh's execution and the barbaric scenes at her funeral, but there was no response.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The Government will not call Israel an apartheid regime. There is no talk of sanctions. Even though the condemnation has been quite strong, it is not anything like the sort of condemnation and action that followed the actions of Putin's bloody regime. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that when the state that commits the war crimes, murder and execution is an ally of members of the European Union or the United States, we take a different attitude. The war crimes committed by our so-called allies or the allies of our allies, whether the United States or the European Union, are somehow less deserving of a response, including the sanctions and accountability that should follow for those crimes. It is plain that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> One would not even feel the need to underline that so much, except what they did to Shireen is part of a systematic campaign of attacking journalists. Some 144 Palestinian journalists have been wounded by Israel since 1992. They were beaten, shot, tear-gassed and so on. Since 1992, 19 journalists have been killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, of whom 16 were Palestinians. During the Gaza assault by Israel last year, Israel targeted and destroyed a building containing Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. This is a systematic campaign by the state of Israel to kill, execute, beat and silence journalists who are trying to expose the truth of the apartheid regime, yet we refuse to impose sanctions. When will the Government impose sanctions on Israel for its murder of journalists, brutal war crimes and crimes against humanity and the Palestinian people?</p>

          <p eId="para_322">Journalism is an art form. Many of us admire the great journalists who have exposed the brutality of some terrible regimes. It is a skill in itself. It is a skill of telling the truth to us all. Those words could summarise Shireen Abu Akleh. She was a journalist who enjoyed great trustworthiness and respect across not only the Middle East but the whole world. Two weeks ago, Israel murdered her in cold blood. She was just one of many journalists targeted by the Israel Defense Forces over the past 20 years. Believe it or not, the Israel Defense Forces have a systematic policy of targeting Palestinian journalists because journalists expose the brutality of the Israeli system. To make matters worse, the Israel Defense Forces stated over the weekend that they will not investigate Shireen's murder. Criminals such as the state of Israel do not have a great track record of investigating themselves. That says everything about Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> What is happening is incredible not only with regard to journalists but also the citizens of Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Israel does not even recognise the International Criminal Court in respect of extrajudicial murders which Israel carries out. My question to the Minister is very simple. We have said this many times in the Chamber. Why is there no sanction against Israel? Why are there no consequences for Israel's actions? The Government pays lip service to what Israel does but there are no consequences. There could be simple things done. One is expelling the Israeli ambassador. There are a number of other things, particularly economic sanctions. There seems to be a lack of guile in how we treat Israel. We must recognise what it is. Israel is an apartheid state. If the Government does not recognise that, there is an issue. It is not just us saying it. Many NGOs such as Amnesty International, B'Tselem and others are exposing Israel for what it is. It is an apartheid, racist state. Why will the Minister not recognise that it is an apartheid state? Most importantly, why are there no sanctions against Israel not only from Ireland but from the European Union?</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I am sharing time with Deputy Niamh Smyth. I am happy to be given the opportunity to speak in this debate. In this House of our peaceful democracy, we weave in and out of the corridors intermingling with journalists working freely to report and analyse, to critique and reflect to those outside in an honest way, and to report faithfully on the facts in front of them. We are privileged to live in such a society. It is a great responsibility for journalists too, to report faithfully and to acknowledge errors if and where they occur. Surely that is everyone’s responsibility but especially those in whom faith is placed to report accurately.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Because of that privilege we all share, we must take time as we are doing today to reflect on those less fortunate, those living and working in war and in particular those who try to report faithfully the honest truth to the outside. The role of journalists, and their support teams, camera people, producers and editors is so important to those of us who it is to be hoped will never experience conflict in ways we have seen in the likes of Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Israel, Iraq and so many other places. If the work of journalists in general is fundamental to the democratic state, it is even more important in situations of conflict to tell the individual stories of war. I acknowledge the sheer bravery of these people to go willingly into such dangerous situations, to tell us the stories of conflict so that we are not ignorant to the struggles faced by so many across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> An academic study published in <i>Media, War &amp; Conflict</i> journal in 2009 highlighted the increasingly common violence against journalists over the previous two decades, a trend that has not abated since. From it, we learn that the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, which is a press protection movement that advocates for and aids detained journalists, reported that two journalists were killed during the First World War and 66 journalists were killed in the Vietnam conflict. In more recent conflicts, from Bosnia to Sierra Leone to Afghanistan, multiple instances of insurgents deliberately targeting journalists have been reported. The trend is even more disturbing in Iraq. Since the war in Iraq began in March 2003, up to 2008, more than 127 journalists and 50 media workers have been killed while on assignment. Those figures from the 2009 study are now clearly out of date.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> Reporters without Borders tells us that between 300 and 700 journalists have been killed in air strikes or executed since 2011 in Syria. It is not possible to confirm an exact number due to many reasons, including lack of record-keeping and lack of transparency. Such a high number shocked me in the course of preparing for these statements. We do not hear enough about this generally across the world. Those figures do not even include the number of journalists arrested or abducted and now missing in the course of their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The increased demand for on-the-ground news coverage of war has made journalists a target for increased attacks. The blurring of lines between war and terrorism has led to previous international conventions on the protection of journalists to be ignored, resulting in increased endangerment. The Committee on the Protection of Journalists has reported that those journalists murdered in war are often killed in acts of reprisal or to prevent them from successfully reporting on the conflict, because of the key role journalists play.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> There are three journalists who have died recently whom I wish to highlight today and then I would like to speak about the day-to-day realities of reporting in conflict. The death last week of Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank is the most recent, tragic death in a long list of journalists who have given their lives for their work. She was a brilliant and effective journalist killed in the course of her work. I would also like to mention another journalist, Ali Al Samoud, who was wounded in the attack that killed Ms Abu Akleh.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> In my own constituency earlier this year, we had the profound loss of Pierre Zakrzewski, a cameraman who had covered conflict across the Middle East, Asia and Africa before his untimely death in Ukraine. It was very early on in Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, where once again we were entirely reliant on journalists for hourly updates and on-the-ground first-hand accounts of the cruelty and devastation.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> At home here in Ireland, two journalists have been killed due to and in the course of their work. Just three years ago, we saw the tragic death of Lyra McKee, who was murdered while observing riots in Northern Ireland. It is a stark reminder of how hard we need to work to maintain peace on this island. Of course, we cannot speak on this subject in this House without remembering the death of Veronica Guerin in 1996, and her work reporting on drug and gang related crimes in Ireland. It is not directly within the terms of this debate but her bravery was no different from those mentioned before.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> There are so many journalists who have been killed. The world saw this so acutely in 2002 when <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> journalist Daniel Pearl, investigating al-Qaeda, was captured and beheaded in Pakistan. There are so many others who can be mentioned. The House will note I have tried to focus on the journalists themselves and the course of their work without trying to attribute blame in any particular way. I simply acknowledge the difficulty of the work they are doing. It is very important to focus on their work, not just their deaths. Work today is ongoing in Ukraine in particular that is beyond brave.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> On the day that Ukraine was invaded, 24 February, I had a Topical Issue matter in the Dáil with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the invasion of Ukraine and what we as a country could do to be supportive. It was my privilege to be able to welcome my friend, a Ukrainian, and her family, into the Gallery and to meet the Minister following the debate. This lady’s brother is Vitaly Sych, chief editor of <i>The New Voice of Ukraine</i>, a leading newspaper. On that day three months ago, she did not know whether he would survive the conflict. She was worried he would be particularly targeted due to his work as a journalist. A decade earlier, a friend of theirs, also a journalist, had been killed by Russians. In spite of that fear, Vitaly has continued to speak out and be extremely vocal on the Russian invasion. He is still there. Just two days ago he was speaking to CNN following his return to Kyiv from Lviv, describing the state of the streets, the remnants and damage caused by street fighting in the main city. He spoke of people returning to their homes to find them broken into and looted. I would like to read an extract from his blog from Ukraine, which is on <i>atlanticcouncil.org</i>, describing the reality of what he is doing on a day-to-day basis:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_335">When my wife hurriedly woke me up in the early hours of February 24 and I first looked out of the window, I could not believe my eyes. The familiar panoramic view from our apartment on the twentieth floor overlooking the Dnipro River was now dotted with huge columns of black smoke. Our entire building was shaking from explosions as missiles rained down on the outskirts of Kyiv. The unthinkable had happened. Even though we all knew Russia had amassed a huge army on the Ukrainian border, I remained convinced until the very last moment that it was all a geopolitical bluff. Like so many Ukrainians, I could not believe anyone would launch a full-scale military invasion in the center of Europe. Such things simply did not happen anymore. Not in 2022. I grabbed my phone and was immediately confronted by footage of Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaiming the start of a “special military operation” in Ukraine. His speech was completely unhinged and full of wild historical distortions. “This is war,” I said to my wife. For weeks I had downplayed her concerns about a possible war, often while gently teasing her and making sarcastic remarks. Despite my apparent confidence, my wife had remained unconvinced. She kept the tank of the car full, evening purchasing and filling an extra petrol canister. She packed changes of clothes and personal documents for all the family and bought lots of dry food. I thought this was over the top and said so. Sadly, she turned out to be right.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_336"> The day had barely begun, but it was already time to get our eight-year-old twins Peter and Anna out of the city. We had read numerous reports from the British and US intelligence services describing in detail how Russian security forces had compiled kill lists of Ukrainian journalists, activists, and politicians hostile to Moscow who were to be rounded up and executed during the initial stages of the occupation. My wife and I knew my name must be somewhere on those lists. A brief look at my Facebook profile or a glance through the magazine I manage would be enough to get me into trouble with the Russians. My magazine’s last cover page before we were forced to suspend publication due to the war had featured Putin alongside senile Russian dictators Lenin and Stalin. All three were portrayed in wheelchairs styled to invoke a well-known Soviet photo of Lenin’s last days. The headline read “Kremlin Madhouse.” This was entirely in keeping with the spirit of the publication. It was clearly unwise for us to stay in Kyiv.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_337"> After more than three days of almost non-stop driving that felt like three weeks, we finally reached the border. Our farewells were mercifully short. As we kissed and hugged our goodbyes, I had no idea if I would ever see my family again. They crossed into Slovakia and were finally safe. A week later, The Irish Times would publish an article about my family's escape headlined "Now we have a chance to cry."</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Until recently, the two children, Peter and Anna, were in school in Dundrum. I believe they now have to return to Ukraine because the Ukrainian Government has decided that state employees have to return to work or else forfeit their positions. These are the incredibly difficult decisions that journalists, but also their families, have to make on a day-to-day basis. These are the realities of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Vitaly remained on the Ukrainian side of the border, entirely alone. Like everyone else there, he was facing a future of uncertainty. He returned to Lviv and his wartime life began. In Lviv, he was living in an apartment with his magazine partner. He got a text message asking if he was still alive. He said he immediately understood that the noise that had woken him up was the sound of Russian ballistic missiles. He states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_340">I peered out of my window and saw smoke rising from somewhere in the downtown area of Lviv. Five Russian missiles had hit the city, leaving seven dead and dozens wounded.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_341">[…]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_342">This was the third Russian airstrike on Lviv, a city close to the EU border that is generally regarded as safe. "Are we still going to do our radio show today?" I asked Serhiy. "Why not?" he replied. So we did. Since settling in Lviv during the early days of the war, we have already broadcast more than 40 episodes of the show. We go on air every day, always around lunchtime.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Vitaly also talks about the location problem he has in respect of living and doing his work. He observes that location is the most important feature, as with all real estate, but that in his case it is definitely a problem. The apartment they are renting is close to a huge military base and on the top floor. He states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_344">The threat of Russian airstrikes is no longer hyperthetical. Indeed, the ambassador of Kazakhstan was living just a few blocks away until recently but was advised by his security team to move out of the neighborhood. This apparent danger is a source of amusement to locals. When they find out where we live, they joke that our landlord should actually be paying us. To make matters worse, the apartment is on the top floor of the building.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Several deadly Russian missile attacks have killed dozens of Ukrainian soldiers in the area. Sirens go off in the city and everybody knows how to react now. Vitaly has now moved back to Kyiv with his family. I just wanted to highlight what he is doing as an example of the role of journalists in conflicts and the challenges they face from day to day. It is such an important matter to reflect upon but it is important to do so not just in respect of Ukraine, Israel and Iraq but also elsewhere around the world. The same challenges are faced in conflict zones by all journalists and we have to commend them for their bravery today.</p>

        <speech by="#CathalBerry" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_346">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this really important debate on the importance of journalism in conflict zones. Even in peacetime, we all appreciate in the Chamber the important role that journalists play. First, they keep the public informed. Second, they act as a counterweight to much of the disinformation on social media. Third, and perhaps most important, they keep the government and, indeed, the opposition in check, hold them accountable and prevent the accumulation of absolute power. Therefore, even from a peacetime perspective, the role of journalism is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Journalism is doubly important in times of conflict all across the world. Journalists keep the public informed as to what is happening on the front line but also keep decision-makers informed. They pass a lot of information from the very front line back to key decision-makers and pile on much pressure for peace talks in the end. Owing to journalists' excellent testimony and reporting, they actually act as a deterrent against war. They assist in holding people to account in the end because of their documentary evidence, videography and photography. They act as a deterrent and promote human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> If we think of all the conflicts over recent centuries, we realise journalists provide an historical record. In some cases, they record excellent examples of bravery and, in other cases, the brutality. In all cases, they remind us conflict is absolutely unnecessary. This is a very important lesson that we should remember.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> As a teenager in the 1990s, I remember listening to the testimony of Orla Guerin when she was reporting from the western Balkans during the break-up of former Yugoslavia. Teenagers, as we all know, are not easily impressed but I recall being very impressed by the quality of her reporting, the unbiased nature of what she was saying and how she was completely disregarding her personal safety. It left a lasting impression on me. The new generation certainly identifies with Donie O'Sullivan, the Irish CNN reporter who reported so well on the insurrection last year in Washington and who continues to report from there. When working in Syria with the UN some years ago, I was sharing a hostel with Tim Marshall from Sky News. I was very impressed by the quality of his reporting and his absolute commitment to providing a truthful account and ensuring the story was not only recorded accurately but also reported to the people who needed to hear it. We should always remember that when journalists enter conflict zones, they are completely unarmed. They are armed only with their microphones, video cameras and notebooks. That takes a completely different type of courage, a completely different type of brave, and we should certainly recognise and respect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> The services journalists provide are not provided for free <i>per se</i>; their profession costs them a lot. The website of Reporters Without Borders shows reporters have suffered severe casualties, even in the past few months. It is only May in 2022 but already 48 media workers have been killed while doing nothing other than their job. The vast majority have been journalists. On top of that, about 500 journalists and media workers are incarcerated all across the world, again for the same reason, which is for doing nothing other than their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> It is appropriate now to consider and remember Pierre Zakrzewski, the Irish citizen who was killed in Ukraine with his Ukrainian colleague back in March, and also Shireen Abu Akleh, who was murdered in the occupied Palestinian territories only a couple of weeks ago. On the latter case, I echo the comments made by some of my colleagues today on the excessive use of force by the police. I welcome the fact that there is an investigation taking place. Prosecutions and accountability must come as soon as possible thereafter. We must also remember journalists who are fortunate enough to survive. They do not suffer only from physical scars because post-traumatic stress, separation from family, the estrangement of children and substance abuse can follow afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> What can we do more as a country, society, Legislature and Parliament to support the excellent work that journalists do? We know where the journalists are being held. We have diplomatic relations with some of the countries in question and should not be afraid to use all the leverage we have, particularly from a trade perspective, to ensure the journalists are released, particularly those who are held without charge completely arbitrarily and who have in some cases been abducted and incarcerated for no reason other than providing good journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said the State is providing funding to provide some equipment for journalists across the country. Items of equipment such as body armour and helmets are a necessity in conflict zones. When looking at the current video footage, I am always concerned when I see soft-skin vehicles being driven by journalists. There are up-armoured Toyota Land Cruisers available that provide considerable protection from small-arms fire. Every responsible media outlet should be providing that equipment for its employees, particularly those it is sending to conflict zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> The Minister also mentioned training. We should certainly consider this. There was a three-day hostile-environment awareness training, HEAT, course run in the Curragh for journalists going to conflict zones. It was run until the pandemic but was then stopped. It could be resuscitated, provided the military gets the appropriate resources to run it. We also need to regulate big-tech companies more to combat false information and fake news on social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> The last requirement, education, is the most important. From a transition-year student's point of view, we need to do more to inform the younger generation and give them the skills to discern what advertising, fake news, opinion journalism, propaganda and quality journalism are. We have a bit of work to do in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I fully appreciate, recognise and respect the role of journalists in conflicts. They provide a great service to democracies. It is now up to democracies to provide a better service to journalists and support them in their work.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The Israeli security forces shot journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in cold blood when she was out doing the most ordinary of things, namely, her job. It is another name and another atrocity in the face of international tolerance of extrajudicial killings, imprisonment, demolition, displacement, illegal settlements, the harassment of children, the destruction and desecration of sacred olive groves and the murder of young children for the crime of playing football on a beach. I could go on. One might ask what is the shooting of a single journalist in that litany of depravity, but it is a lot. Killing her and knowing they would get away with it meant killing her witness and her power to bring the truth about the treatment of Palestinian people into international focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> Her funeral was its own witness. No objective person could be unmoved by the scenes. Murder was not enough; degradation and dehumanisation followed. I give particular attention to the pall-bearers, especially one gentleman who, despite being repeatedly beaten to the ground and kicked, rose like a hero to prevent what he saw as the ultimate degradation of Shireen's remains and her coffin hitting the ground. While others run from bombs and gunfire, Shireen and other war reporters run towards the front to bring us the news as it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> An Irishman, Pierre Zakrzewski, was killed by Russian forces in Ukraine while doing his job. We owe Pierre a huge debt of gratitude and I underline to his family and friends the high regard in which he is held by all of us here. He will not be forgotten in Ireland. In Ireland, we owe war journalists and photojournalists so much because, without Gilles Peress in Derry, we would not have the iconic photographs of human rights protesters under fire and the white flag held by Father Edward Daly. Bloody Sunday would have been buried as the British Government tried to bury the Ballymurphy massacre that took place a few months earlier. Gilles Peress told the Saville inquiry how amazed his bureau chief in Paris was that he got a picture of an unarmed man shot dead by British forces. We are lucky he was there to capture those moments and that he is still here to remind us what is at stake and at risk through the intransigence, pride and recklessness of some.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Today we remember all journalists who have lost their lives in the job of telling truth to power. We remember and thank them. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">We are dealing at the moment with attacks on democracy and truth and the necessity for real journalism. Many have mentioned the issue of the social media giants, the working of their algorithms and how they, at times, facilitate the telling of mistruths. We have a duty of care and protection for the vital work, particularly in conflict situations, carried out by journalists. In our country, we remember the courageous work carried out by Veronica Guerin, Lyra McKee and Martin O'Hagan. Unfortunately, these people paid with their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> When we talk about modern-day conflicts, we think of Irish citizen Pierre Zakrzewski, who died in Ukraine, and we cannot but think of Shireen Abu Akleh, who was executed or assassinated - use what term you want - by the so-called Israel Defense Forces. We have all called out the actions of Vladimir Putin and his regime in Ukraine. A huge number of sanctions have been imposed, and rightfully so, but the problem is we are dealing with an Israel that is willing to execute journalists and to carry out the heinous act of attacking a funeral. We have seen that happen before in Ireland and South Africa, and it is generally by regimes that have nothing to offer and that are failing and trying to oppress a community. They generally fail. That is the only good news we have at this point. Israel is a rogue state that has executed journalists, engages in the annexation of land and operates apartheid policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> We would like to see action across Europe. We do not necessarily want to see unilateral action but sometimes there is no choice. Sometimes the majority does not have the right to be wrong and we have to take action. I call on the Government to call out Israel. Beyond that, we have to look at sanctions. Then we can go beyond Ireland at that stage.</p>

All of us will speak from a personal and collective point of view of the importance of reporting by the media from conflict zones around the world in a brave manner that stands to all of humanity. It is important to ensure there is clarity, the exposition of crimes and a living, unchallengeable record of this. In the emerging age of social media and the use of disinformation and misinformation as a form of hybrid warfare, the role of independent, verifiable journalism during times of conflict has never been more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I will speak on the murder of Pierre Zakrzewski in March by a Russian bomb in Ukraine. Being a joint Irish-French national, he was known to many in his Chamber, or at least many in this Chamber have been able to tell his story. He grew up in Leopardstown in my constituency. The family was gratefully appreciative of the assistance given by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the repatriation of his remains, of the compassion shown and of the presence of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at his funeral in Foxrock.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I spoke to a number of his friends and acquaintances from the area, who asked me to relay a couple of points about the scenes he saw over a lengthy career as a photojournalist around the world in many conflict zones, not just recently in Ukraine. They mention that on what may have been his last day alive, Pierre found a two-month-old baby, alone, injured, on the ground, among rubble and ruins. His first reaction was not to take a picture or to report it. It was the first reaction any human being would have: to bring that baby to safety and find it a safe family and support. While he managed to bring the baby to receive medical attention, sadly that baby was killed. Pierre himself was killed the very next day.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> It shows the reality of what journalists face in conflict zones and the effects that remain with them long after they leave. I am told that, when visiting various war and conflict zones over his career, Pierre told friends and family he rarely felt scared. He was confident in the internal protections of journalists and felt relatively safe with his team and their journalistic credentials. However, he told those close to him that the war in Ukraine was completely different and everyone was a target. The rules of respect for journalists and safe zones were disregarded by the Russians and Pierre ultimately fell victim to this, as did the many medics and humanitarians who have been killed in this vicious war. It is clear from everything I have heard about Pierre that he died doing what he loved. This was his passion and vocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Today and every day when we watch the news or open Twitter and see videos and photos from these war zones, we need to remind ourselves of the sacrifices made to bring this footage to us. I commend the recent change in editorial policy of RTÉ such that when acknowledging reports from conflict zones, they do not just acknowledge the on-screen reporter or journalist but also the camera and production crew with them. That is extremely important. We cannot sit idly by and allow this to continue, in Ukraine or any other war zone. Pierre's friends told me he often said when speaking of his time reporting on war zones that when you think you have seen the worst excesses of man's inhumanity to man, you realise the strength of the human spirit. We are seeing in Ukraine an horrendous conflict that will have an impact on our society and homes for many years. The sooner the conflict comes to an end and the people of Ukraine can be liberated and protected, the better for everyone across this Continent and planet, not just those directly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> It is all well and good having statements but statements have to come with protections and with the legislative will and political desire to ensure the protection of journalists as they report from conflict zones and from extremely difficult situations domestically.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">We must ensure they have that freedom of integrity and are covered properly by modern defamation laws that allow them to report the truth and not be muzzled by the financial arm of criminal or political movements that wish to silence their truth. The debt we in this State owe to the bravery of so many domestic investigative journalists in the fields of crime, conflict zones, politics or elsewhere is one that we in this Chamber may not appreciate as great. That gratitude, however, needs to be shown in the form of proper professional protections. Deputy Berry rightly mentioned the extreme conditions training at the Curragh that used to be made available to all journalists and members of the National Union of Journalists. That is absolutely something that should be brought up. Only last week, I spoke to a British friend of mine who works for a British newspaper and is doing exactly that sort of training because he is about to be posted to Ukraine for four weeks. That is the sort of protection we need to give to journalists.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_373">Like other Members, I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue. The killings of Shireen Abu Akleh, Lyra McKee, Pierre Zakrzewski and many others remind us just how important journalism is to the freedoms that we are fortunate enough to have in our society. The safety of journalists is one of the cornerstones of freedom of expression. The killings of those journalists remind us of the extraordinary risks that people reporting from conflict zones have to face daily. Many journalists have paid the ultimate price for seeking to bring us the news so that we can a form proper understanding of what is happening in these conflicts.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> On average, 90 journalists each year are killed in conflict situations and many more are imprisoned as a result of their work. An appalling figure is that 60% of those killed were targeted. They were not accidentally caught in crossfire. There is systematic targeting of people who seek to provide objective reporting of what is happening, and 87% of those crimes are not solved. Journalists are in a highly dangerous game of roulette as they seek to bring us information that is fair and objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The tragedy is that the power of the digital age has made doing so even more risky. While preparing for these statements, I read a report that detailed how three quarters of women operating in conflict zones had reported online violence. This was systematic intimidation and threats online against journalists who were being targeted. One in four of those cases turned into offline violence. The targeting online was the precursor to exposing people to that sort of violent attack. All present have seen the power of social media to whip up a storm of anger against individuals. We have to be extraordinarily careful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> It was good to hear the remarks of the Minister on what is being sought and pursued within the UN. We need to uphold stronger principles to protect journalists in these situations and find protocols that get more international acceptance that this is something we treasure. We have to uphold the right of journalists to have the freedom to express their point of view and not to be taken off air. The Minister stated that more than 150 journalists have had to leave Russia because they could no longer continue to operate their trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> What is particularly worrying is that there is no objective and independent investigation into these killings. In the case of the death of Shireen Abu Akleh last week, there have been two ostensible investigations with completely different results but still no opportunity for an independent investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> We must also consider the online platforms and their responsibilities in cases where they are being used in conflict situations to target journalists who are trying to speak the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The second dimension of this debate is the extreme difficulty in reporting in conflict situations anyway. It is said that the first casualty of war is truth and that is undoubtedly the case. Any glimpses we get into the reporting within Russia of this war highlight clearly how diametrically different is the reporting and presentation of the war that is being presented to ordinary Russian people who believe it is about protecting their safety and position.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> We need to try to create an environment where journalists can operate more freely and be heard. Not only do they risk their safety daily, but they also take risks in the context of protecting their sources and communications, as well as validating claims that are being made to them. They are often caught between a frightened population, overbearing patriotism, a well-honed war machine with its spinners, and the demands of a hungry 24-hour media that wants to be first. Those pressures are extraordinary on the journalists who are trying to carry them. Martin Bell spoke of the pressures of being in that position. He described the role of those who fund journalism, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_381">They aim to be first and fastest with the news. Their nature, too often, is to be fearful, feverish, frenzied, frantic, frail, false and fallible.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Those are the words of probably one of the foremost journalists in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Journalists take on an extraordinarily difficult role but when democracy and freedom of expression is under sustained threat, as it is at present in many parts of the world, it is vital that we support the importance of journalism in trying to make sense for us of these extraordinary conflicts. While we try manfully to bring forward change at UN level and in other international forums, we have to strive to ensure that when the conflict ends there is no impunity for those who struck down journalists in the midst of the conflict. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure that people will continue take those risks to bring a fair and balanced picture to those who need to make sense of extraordinarily difficult conflicts. If we cannot make sense of these conflicts, there is little chance that we can resolve them.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">Journalists are our eyes and ears when it comes to the many conflicts across the world. They have an important role not just in reporting what is going on in these conflicts, but also in dissecting the cause of the hatred or economic opportunity that prompts or prolongs conflict, or examining how certain conflicts are used for purely economic gain, bigotry or discrimination. Many regimes see that as a threat to their purpose. The work of journalists is seen by some of these governments as putting an unwelcome focus on the true purpose of the ambitions of the regime and the lengths to which it will go to realise those ambitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> That is just one more danger faced by journalists who already put themselves in danger to report the truth. We have seen this in the case of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera journalist who was murdered - not killed, as some others say - by Israeli forces as they conducted a military raid near the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. She was murdered despite being clearly identifiable as a journalist, as were three others who were fired upon as attempts were made by the military to disguise the truth of what is happening in the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> We have seen the great work being done by journalists to shed light on the devastation and atrocities being carried out by Russian forces, the Government of which insists to this day that it is a special operation. We need those journalists to break through that propaganda. They are achieving that, but it has already come at a grave cost to a high number of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Journalists in conflict areas face another obstacle in their work and that results from the inaction of governments elsewhere to address the injustices the journalists expose. As the saying goes, the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. Apart from that saying being gender exclusive, it is a message that holds true. </p>
          <p eId="para_388">Governments throughout the world have watched on as the Saudi Arabian assault of Yemen continues. Since the war started in 2015 it is estimated that 370,000 people have died. Meanwhile so-called allied countries have been selling weapons to the Saudi Arabian regime openly, adding to the horror and grief in Yemen. Journalists who put themselves in the way of harm have to contend with the willingness of members of the international community to turn away from conflicts because of the financial arrangements they have in place with the dominant power.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> These journalists and the people whose plight they are reporting on deserve more than the self-serving attitude that is adopted by countries across the world which do not want to affect the <i>status quo</i>. We have seen it in our own country and other areas around the world. Journalists in conflict zones must be thanked for their work and commitment. They deserve to be listened to and for the injustices on which they shed light to be addressed by those powers that watch on and maybe, just maybe, governments might take action.</p>

        <speech by="#SorcaClarke" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Deputy Sorca Clarke<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">It has been well observed that truth is the first casualty of war. It has been equally well observed that the only antidote to propaganda purported in a time of conflict is the truth. In areas of conflict journalism has a vital role. When covering war or conflict professional journalists do not just circulate facts and information. They also frame and promote deliberation and debate. By supplying credible information the media also has a vital role to play in promoting democratic principles. As we have seen the global reporting of atrocities being committed can be a significant contributory factor in bringing parties to the peace table.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> However, conflict reporting has been a risky occupation and attacks on the press take many forms. Kidnapping, threats, arrest, imprisonment, harassment - with women in particular being targeted – are becoming all too common. Between 2010 and 2019 almost 900 journalists were killed while doing their job. In November 2020 the UN Secretary General stated that the fundamental role of journalists in ensuring access to reliable information is essential to achieving durable peace, sustainable development and human rights, and recalled that all civilians, including journalists engaged in professional missions, must be respected and protected under international humanitarian law. Although many have lost their lives covering conflicts, far more are also murdered for investigating issues such as corruption, trafficking, political wrongdoing, human rights violations and environmental issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Ultimately the reason we are having this discussion today is because of the brutal and senseless murder of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. When covering an Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, she was shot dead. Eyewitnesses who were present at the scene said she was killed by Israeli forces. This killing has rightly attracted global condemnation as did the shameful events at her funeral. There can be no double standards here. There can be no box ticking masquerading as accountability particularly in a week where we have seen another soldier, in another conflict, sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a civilian. This action needs accountability and Israel needs to be held to account for the actions and the murder of that veteran journalist.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">The extraordinary courage of journalists and media workers reporting from conflict areas in Ukraine and other parts of the world reminds us once again how crucial their work is in providing timely, trusted and fact-based information to the public. This debate should serve as an opportunity to celebrate their vital contribution and draw attention to the increasing pressures, threats and attacks they face while also calling for the protection of all journalists by ensuring they are supported to ensure freedom, independence and pluralism of the media generally. The death of nine journalists and media workers in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion underscores for us all the level of danger to which those covering conflict are exposed. To maintain freedom of the press, which is essential for democracy, journalists must be able to complete their jobs safely. Yet, media workers are increasingly facing danger and even death particularly in conflict zones and in some countries around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> In 2021, the European Federation of Journalists reported six assassinations of journalists in Europe. Journalists have also been violently attacked when covering demonstrations or investigating allegations of corruption, organised crime and environmental malpractice. In 2021, according to the International Press Institute, 45 journalists were killed while undertaking their jobs throughout the world. So far this year that figure sits at the unfortunate figure of 28 journalists killed in the line of duty. The most important thing that can be done in cases targeting media in violent acts is accountability, according to the International Press Institute. In fact the institute data shows that in at least 90% of cases in which journalists are murdered those responsible are not held to account. This creates a cycle of impunity where those responsible feel that they can act without consequences and see it as an open invitation to attack journalists. This points to an urgent need to ensure a meaningful judicial response. Otherwise the number of killings will continue to grow. Additionally journalists are also routinely targeted with online threats and hate speech. Female journalists in particular face vicious, sexualised and malicious online attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Independent journalism is imperilled by increasing crackdowns on press freedom, targeted surveillance and judicial harassment of journalists, high levels of impunity for crimes against journalists, editorial capture by political or business interests and mounting financial difficulties for many news outlets.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I am glad to be able to speak on these timely statements on the situation regarding brave journalists. The death of nine journalists and media workers in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion underscores for us all the level of danger to which those covering conflict are exposed. Today we remember Irish cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed in Ukraine when his vehicle was hit by Russian shelling on 14 March. He was working for the US network, Fox News, in Horenka. Mr. Zakrzewski was a brave veteran warzone photographer who had covered multiple conflicts, including Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Unfortunately the killing of journalists is not limited to conflict situations. Furthermore the recent shooting of the reporter in the West Bank is among the numerous killings of media workers worldwide. Last year, 2021, a large number, I think it was 40 journalists, were killed under attack. It is just unbelievable. We have to protect and salute those brave journalists who go out to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I remember as a young person I listened to the brave Robert Fisk reporting from Beirut. Little did I think years later I would be visiting him. He was the first person who I remember reporting from war zones. It is important to remember that as well as in war zones, there are issues in this country that have not been reported on and are not allowed to be reported on. There were 51 lives lost in Whiddy Island, Bantry, in 1979 and we have not had any proper inquiries. That was whitewashed. We lost two young men off Helvick Head 15 years ago this week, John O’Brien and his friend Pat Esmonde, and we have failed to get a proper investigation. None of the board members of our Marine Casualty Investigation Board has seagoing experience. I am not trying to diminish anything that is happening with the Russian war in Ukraine, or any other war zone, but we have to wash all our dirty linen, including our own. It is our duty to expose what is happening. There are many other situations in this country that have not had proper investigations. The case of Fr. Niall Molloy in County Offaly had one cover-up after another. It is not all confined to war zones.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I really appreciate this opportunity to speak on this because the role of journalists in reporting from places of conflict is so important. For example in the Ukraine war, we will all be expecting and hoping that people will be brought to justice for the criminal acts that are taking place. The killing of the Irish cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, was so upsetting not just to his own family but it was a tragedy for the professionalism of journalism and camera people in this country and throughout the world. To think that nine journalists have lost their lives since the start of this war, this illegal invasion of peaceful people, and the fact that 28 journalists have lost their lives since the start of 2022 quite simply because they are guilty of doing their job. It is a respectable job, the operation of reporting on what is happening and letting us see. Nine journalists died in Mexico obviously because of the serious drug problem there and the fact that the drug cartels believe they can do whatever they wish. The authorities in Mexico seem completely incapable or worse, unwilling, to do anything about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">To those good people who have lost their lives and their families, it is a tragedy beyond belief to think that they could not go about their duties. The role that journalists are playing and the evidence that they are gathering and giving to the rest of world may prove important during war tribunals that will happen, please God, sooner rather than later, when these people will be brought to justice for the criminal acts they are perpetrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> These people deserve our support because of their courage and bravery. They are putting themselves in harm's way to make sure we are informed fully and for that we should be eternally grateful.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">Journalists must be commended on their courage and bravery in tackling many of the issues in conflict zones around the world. I believe 28 journalists have been killed so far in 2022. I offer my condolences to their families and friends. It is sad that so many journalists are targeted with online bullying, threats and hate speech. I understand that female journalists are attacked even more viciously on a regular basis, both online and offline.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Many of our news outlets are harassed in the courts when they challenge controversial issues, particularly around business interests. Media coverage gives an uncovered issue visibility and, unlike some social media, the accountability is where the individual journalist is willing to put his or her name to the story. One of the most famous journalism partnerships was Bernstein and Woodward, when they uncovered the Watergate scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The most famous investigative journalist in Ireland will always be foremost in our thoughts, namely the late Veronica Guerin, who targeted underworld crime and gave her life to protect us. I offer my condolences to her family also.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> My final tribute is to Charlie Bird, who has given a lifetime to his work as a journalist, and is on yet another mission to get answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> In Ukraine, we have seen journalists go out and put their lives on the line to give us the true story of what is happening. They have to be commended on the bravery that they have shown and be respected for what they are doing - leaving their families to give us news.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> We can see on social media that within two minutes false news comes up but there is no accountability. At least with journalists, they put their names to their stories. They do not always get it right but at least their name is there. They are doing their best and they are willing to put their name on the line for it. Journalists need to be commended on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">Fáiltím roimh an deis ráiteas a dhéanamh anseo inniu faoin ról ríthábhachtach atá ag iriseoirí i dtuairisciú limistéir choimhlinte ar fud an domhain. Time after time, journalists confront the worst that is happening around the world. They are determined, sometimes at great risk to themselves, to report honestly and truthfully not only on difficult and dangerous conflicts, but also on corruption and the violation of human rights. The fundamental purpose of journalism - the pursuit of the truth – is absolutely vital to us as citizens. Without it we would be left in the dark, at risk of being overwhelmed by disinformation, biased commentary and conspiracy theories.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> It is important to stress at the outset that risks to journalists fundamentally emanate not from the vocation of journalism, but from threats to journalists from states and criminal and paramilitary groups. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, reports that over 1,523 journalists have been killed since 1993 in the course of doing their jobs. This is a stark and troubling number. To echo the words of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, earlier, we are no strangers to such attacks on our own island. Let us recall the terrible killings of Lyra McKee, Martin O’Hagan and Veronica Guerin. They were each courageous and respected journalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I have also been struck by the courage of Irish journalists and camera operators, along with all the support staff, who provide us with essential reports from conflict zones around the globe. This is particularly evident in the continuing conflict in Ukraine. The death of Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irish camera operator, alongside 24-year-old Ukrainian journalist and producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova in Ukraine, demonstrates this courage. Pierre's funeral was held in Ireland in March. He grew up in my own constituency in Leopardstown. Pierre was an inspiration; he was larger than life, according to some of his friends and colleagues. It was through his journeys around Europe in his teens, and later in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that Pierre's fondness for photography and politics developed into freelance journalism. It was relayed at his funeral that "his qualities were endless ... he lived his life for the benefit of others". It was also conveyed that Pierre was full of vision, innovative in his work and in the world, a truth teller, full of empathy and what many referred to as "a humanitarian". Journalists working in war zones often share some of these attributes, but the dangers they face can be great.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> In a separate but no less terrible incident, the shooting of Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank earlier this month is a stark reminder of the dangers journalists face in conflict zones. Equally, I condemn the actions of Israeli police at the funeral of Ms Abu Akleh. These were horrific scenes of police brutality at a very sensitive event. The Palestinian-American was a household name across the Arabic-speaking world. I, too, am backing the international calls for an independent investigation into her killing.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I also note that a delegation for relations with Palestine, which included two Irish MEPs, was recently informed by Israeli authorities that it would not be allowed to visit the Gaza region "as a delegation". The delegation of six MEPs, including the Green Party South MEP, Ms Grace O'Sullivan, and the Sinn Féin Midlands North-West MEP, Mr. Chris MacManus, were due to arrive in Israel over the weekend <i>en route</i> to Palestine via Tel Aviv. However, at the last minute, the group was informed that the mission would not be able to go ahead. The President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, is currently visiting Israel and has pledged to raise this issue. I echo the concerns raised by my party colleague, Grace O’Sullivan MEP, as well as by the European Parliament President.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> All threats to journalists, whether in the form of physical or online attacks, represent a threat to media freedom and the freedom of the press. We know that a free, independent and pluralistic media is a vital component in holding a state and powerful institutions to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> It has been said before that the first casualty of war is truth, and we have witnessed that in recent times. The steps taken by the Russian state against its own independent media represent a clear demonstration that it fears the truth about Russian aggression in Ukraine being shown and explained to Russian citizens and is evading responsibility for what is being done by Russian forces in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The framework for supporting an independent media includes a robust legislative and constitutional foundation for press freedom and an overarching framework for the regulation of the media that protects press freedom and promotes media plurality. As Minister with responsibility for media, I am keenly aware of the responsibility I and the Government have in providing the necessary legislative safeguards that promote a strong and independent media sector. The Government recognises that journalists and other media actors play a central role in enabling the full enjoyment of freedom of expression and are critical to the healthy functioning of our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> We must reinforce the protections afforded to journalists and other media actors engaged in work that is instrumental for the healthy operation of democracy. Media freedom is a core European value that is given expression in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and is a cornerstone of democracy. Without freedom of the press, a well-informed citizenry cannot exist. Without a well-informed citizenry, democracy cannot function in any meaningful sense of the word. Journalists are a central component in our civil society, and a free media has been a powerful force for positive change and democratic transformation everywhere. All forms of attacks on journalists and other media actors must be regarded as attacks on democracy and strongly condemned.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> As we know from our own experience on this island, threats to journalists are not confined to countries that would traditionally be classified as zones of ongoing conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">In recognition of the growing number of threats to journalists across the EU, in September 2021 the European Commission published a recommendation on the safety of journalists. The recommendation calls on member states to vigorously investigate and prosecute all criminal acts, making full use of existing national and European legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> To support the recommendation, first announced in the European democracy action plan, the European Commission has also indicated that it will propose a European media freedom Act in response to growing concerns regarding diminishing media plurality, which can have a chilling effect on independent journalism. The Commission has indicated that the European media freedom Act will seek to ensure that the EU media market functions better by improving legal certainty and will set out a mechanism to increase the transparency, independence and accountability of actions affecting media markets, freedom and pluralism within the EU. I support collaboration between member states in order to safeguard media freedoms across the EU and look forward to working with the Commission and other member states when that Act is published.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has indicated, Ireland assumed the Presidency of the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe last week. The Council of Europe has played an importance role in promoting the independence of the media and security of journalists. The work of the steering committee on media and information society of the Council of Europe has been particularly important. Last June, I attended the conference of Ministers responsible for media and information society, which adopted a resolution on the safety of journalists, setting out the importance of protecting journalists and an enabling environment for media freedom. This steering committee on media and information society is holding its 21st plenary session next week, at which the topic of journalist safety will be further considered, particularly in light of the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> All states have a duty to respect, protect and promote human rights, and it is crucial that journalists and other media actors as part of civil society have the space in which to do their jobs free from violence and intimidation. A free and independent media is indispensable for democracy. I absolutely condemn any threats or attacks on individual journalists or on the foundations of the sector as a whole. We must treat these attacks with the utmost seriousness. Tá sé ríthábhachtach do struchtúr ár sochaí go leanaimid ar aghaidh ag déanamh gach iarracht chun tacú le preas daonlathach agus saor agus chun sábháilteacht iriseoirí a chosaint, anseo in Éirinn agus thar lear.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Leddin<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_422">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak. Much too often we take for granted this opportunity to voice our ideas and opinions freely and without repercussions. It is not a luxury afforded to politicians in many other countries around the world and it is even less likely that the people reporting on the business of politics, state affairs and international conflicts would be given the same assurances.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Our discourse in this House can be biased, ideological and charged but the message of a journalist is not a personal story or subjective thought. Instead, journalists act as conduits, narrating a story based on their observations and discoveries. Being objective in the face of traditional state-run propaganda is more than just a challenge to reporters; it is very often a question of life and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> In our collective memory, there are numerous records of the enormous sacrifices made by journalists reporting on the Troubles. This is not something of the past. Lyra McKee was shot dead just three years ago. She was a woman and someone's partner and child. She was a reporter of truth and hers was a life forever lost to a cowardly hand that could not tolerate the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Trustworthy news contributes to the protection of civilians and brings the reality of conflict to the attention of the international community while exposing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. As I am speaking, we are witnessing the Russian state propaganda machine broadcasting the successes of the "special military operation" in Ukraine while Ukrainian and western media rightly call the invasion a war. A few weeks after Putin's invasion of Ukraine began, a law was enacted in Russia making it a criminal offence to publicly transmit, including by means of social networks, any "deliberately false information about the deployment of the military forces of the Russian Federation". That includes reporting on casualty figures that depart from officially approved numbers and using the word "war".</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Misinformation and propaganda are no longer the domain of the traditional media in totalitarian regimes. There is now an even greater threat of misinformation and manipulation masquerading as first-hand information and independent reporting through social media platforms. Most of it is never subject to any form of scrutiny and far removed from what is objective reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> In 1990, the International Federation of Journalists published its first list of journalists killed. In the 30 years since, a further 2,658 journalists have been killed, with approximately two journalists or media workers dying every week. As colleagues mentioned, most journalists are murdered in reprisal for what they write as opposed to being killed by the hazards of reporting from combat zones. According to the International Federation of Journalists, nearly 75% of journalists killed around the world did not step on a landmine, get shot in crossfire or die in a suicide bombing but were instead murdered outright, such as being killed by a gunman escaping on the back of a motorcycle, being shot or stabbed to death near their home or office or being found dead having been abducted and tortured.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Daniel Pearl, Anna Politkovskya, Pavel Sheremet, Daphne Caruana Galizia, Lyra McKee, Pierre Zakrzewski and Shireen Abu Akleh are the names we might recognise of too many who have died while working as journalists in the past 20 years. However, the risk to local journalists, whose names do not resonate in the media, have an impact beyond incidents. This sends a signal to countless others that they or members of their family could be next. These names are more than that; they are sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, friends and colleagues. They have dedicated their lives and paid the ultimate price for their work as journalists for exercising freedom of expression and holding governments and groups to account. It is not enough simply to remember them and speak in their honour. Their murderers must be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> There are journalists reporting from around the world today and providing the public with accurate and timely information. We must provide a safe and enabling environment for freedom of expression and guarantee freedom of the media to ensure these people can effectively perform their professional duties, especially in times of crisis.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_430">I appreciate the opportunity to take part in this discussion on journalists in conflict zones around the world. I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for his detailed speech and confirmation that the promotion and protection of all human rights remains a key foreign policy priority for Ireland. We will hold him to account in that regard, particularly in respect of the many countries not promoting human rights, including Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I note we have assumed the Presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, as the Minister clarified. We became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949, the year we became a republic. I could not put it any better than the Minister so it is important to repeat what he said. He indicated the most recent figures from Reporters Without Borders provide a "grim" background to today's debate, with 939 journalists and media workers killed across the globe during the ten years from 2011 to 2020. Last year alone, 50 journalists were killed and 302 were imprisoned. Many people have paid tribute to Lyra McKee, Martin O'Hagan and Veronica Guerin, which is right, along with Simon Cumbers and Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed with a colleague on 14 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The figures are grim, as has been said, so what is our role, as an actively neutral country, in the promotion of peace and the protection of journalists, who are an absolutely essential part of a vibrant democracy? We cannot have a democracy without courageous independent journalists. We have seen the work of Orla Guerin, John Pilger and Robert Fisk, who died recently. It is really important we understand the role of independent journalists is vital. We can compare it to the role of journalists who have allowed themselves to be embedded at different points in different wars - Iraq comes to mind - and we realise the importance of protecting independent journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Journalists operate under constant threat and in constant fear of their lives. They lose their lives. It is important that the narrative from any dominant power is questioned, and that is what they do. We do not have narratives just from the bad guys.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">There are narratives that are self-serving for all powers and at all times they must be questioned. We fail to do so at our peril as it endangers our democracy. If we look at what is and is not covered as a story, the abominable illegal invasion of Ukraine has to be covered without a doubt but the focus has been taken off many other wars. I know it is difficult but if we determine our foreign policy and neutrality by what is nearest to us and geographical proximity, which is the most human thing to do and it is right to give humanitarian aid, then we are in danger of losing the respect we have. This is one of the main reasons we got a seat on the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> A number of conflicts are not receiving attention at present. There are many reasons for this, one being they are not top of the list of journalists' priorities. I say this only to highlight it. There has been an appalling loss of life in Yemen and it is ongoing. The figures mean so little at this point because they are so high. This war is backed fully by Saudi Arabia, with which we are friends. Then we have Tigray, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Congo and Somalia. I ask that we bear in mind always that we have a very important role as one of three remaining neutral countries to use our voice at all times to question. Part of this questioning has to be done by investigative journalism. The other part has to be done by democratically elected Deputies in the Dáil and parliamentarians elsewhere. The protection of journalists has been recognised for a very long time. We can go to the Hague Convention and declarations as far back as 1899.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> In Ukraine we have lost seven journalists since the invasion. The Committee to Protect Journalists, which has been mentioned, is investigating the deaths of seven others. In addition, 14 journalists have been jailed in Russia, which is proceeding to introduce the most draconian legislation to silence journalists even further. Again, there is a role for us as a parliament to support good journalists in Russia and the people on the ground who do not want this war. They want the war to stop. We need to hear their voices also. We need to stand with them in stopping the war because it has to stop at some stage and the sooner the better. There is a role for all of us in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> On 11 May, as has been mentioned and it cannot be mentioned often enough, Ms Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. She had been a journalist with Al Jazeera for 25 years. She was known for her courage in documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule. Words cannot cover what happened to her in life and death. It brings into acute focus the impunity with which the Israeli Government operates, and I distinguish the Israeli Government from the Israeli people. I know there are courageous people in Israel who have spoken out repeatedly about the apartheid regime - the words of Amnesty International, not mine - operating there. The government there acts with impunity. We have a report from Amnesty and the Government is still analysing it. We are still waiting for a response from the Government. I read the report. I never expected a busy Minister to read it in the first few days after it came out but it has been weeks since it was published and we have no response to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> The failure by the Israeli establishment to carry out an independent investigation into Ms Abu Akleh's killing is nothing short of shocking and appalling. It has come back and said it was an active combat situation. I do not know how we are not calling this out for what it is. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has certainly issued very strong words. What is the next step? Last week, we heard IDA Ireland has a liaison person on the ground in Israel to bring us closer in terms of trade. The comment on this was that it is nothing unusual. Unusual or not, it is most unacceptable that we would tighten our links in this manner while this is going on. We are letting it happen in our name.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I want to mention Malta, which is another neutral country. A journalist was killed there, right on our doorstep. She was 53 when she was killed in a bomb in October 2017. She had spent 30 years as a journalist uncovering networks of corruption in Malta and abroad. Her car exploded. There is finally a public inquiry but it was precipitated by a resolution passed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which shows how important that organisation is. It found the state was responsible for her death. I know there are processes in place at present. A 437-page report found the state had created an atmosphere of impunity generated by the highest echelons.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I want to mention Julian Assange, whom this and all previous Governments have utterly ignored. In 2010, this extremely courageous man published almost 500,000 documents from Chelsea Manning. Included was a video in which two US soldiers in an Apache helicopter gunned down a group of unarmed civilians. There is any number of examples of what this man did. The UK Supreme Court is stating he can be extradited. We are awaiting an announcement from the relevant minister. This man is being extradited while at the same time the UK Prime Minister is addressing Russia, and rightly so, on journalists. He is completely ignoring what is happening with Julian Assange and what he is doing in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> I also want to mention Jamal Khashoggi and what happened to him in 2018. We have let this go by also without any action following our condemnation of the role of Saudi Arabia in this, while we tighten up our relationship with that country. We divide the world on the basis of who is and is not our friend. It is them and us. That is an extremely dangerous foreign policy.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Thomas Byrne)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_442">Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí uilig as an díospóireacht chuimsitheach inniu maidir le hiriseoirí in áiteanna ina bhfuil coimhlint iontu timpeall an domhain. I add my condolences to the families of Shireen Abu Akleh and Pierre Zakrzewski and his colleague Oleksandra Kuvshynova. They are three of the most well-known journalists who have been killed in conflict recently. I send sympathies to their families and to the families of the other journalists killed in the Ukraine conflict this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> This is a timely debate, not only because it follows the murders of journalists but this evening Ireland has called an informal Security Council meeting focusing specifically on the protection of journalists. In addition to our work at the UN and EU, earlier this year Ireland joined the Media Freedom Coalition. This is a cross-regional collaboration of 52 countries that co-ordinate to promote the safety of media workers and to hold to account those who seek to harm them. This complements Ireland's work as a founding member of the Freedom Online Coalition, which, since 2011, has protected the right to freedom of opinion and expression online.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Many areas of conflict and many journalists have been mentioned. I do not think we should categorise them with "but something else" as some speakers have during the debate. I will mention many of the circumstances and journalists who have been mentioned. In Afghanistan, press freedom has been severely curtailed since the Taliban's seized power last August. Human Rights Watch has found that 70% of media outlets have closed. Reporters without Borders has recorded 80 cases of detained media workers and at least two journalists have been killed. In Afghanistan, of course, women are very disproportionately affected. Ireland has consistently used its voice at the Security Council on human rights in Afghanistan, including the rights of journalists. We will do so again in today in New York with other Security Council members. Deputies are aware that journalists and their families are among the almost 500 Afghan refugees now safely in Ireland under the refugee protection programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">There are also a number of Ukrainian journalists here as part of that programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> In Myanmar, there have also been attacks on civilians, including reporters. The military has closed independent outlets, interfered with access to the Internet, blocked social media platforms and proposed a cybersecurity law that would empower the state with greater surveillance capabilities. Through multilateral organisations, of which we are a member, Ireland has called on the military to release those arbitrarily detained and cease violence. We also want full accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> In Hong Kong, which I believe was not mentioned in this debate, since the closure of <i>Apple Daily</i> last year, there has been a raid on the offices of <i>Stand News</i> and the arrest of its staff and the self-closure of <i>Citizen News</i>. The national security laws have been followed by the targeting and suppression of independent media, thereby eroding protected rights and freedoms under the Basic Law. We have spoken out in support of media freedom and free speech in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Mexico is apparently the most dangerous country in which to be a journalist in 2021, according to NGOs. We are working closely with the European Union and others to protect journalist, condemn killings and call people to account. The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, headed a United Nations NGO round-table meeting which discussed security issues for journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Deputies mentioned countries in Africa, including Eritrea and Somalia. We are also working to ensure a vibrant media space can exist. The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. Simon was a journalist from Meath who was killed approximately 20 years ago in a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. We have an Irish Aid programme that enables journalists to report on stories of contemporary life in developing countries that would otherwise not be told. More than 400 assignments have been funded by the Department under this fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I note, in particular, the strong statements, rightly so, on the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh. Her killing, which ended her professional witness to the situation in occupied Palestinian territory, led to justifiable outrage and anger in Palestine, in the Dáil and globally. It is vital that journalists are protected to report on the effects of conflict on the lives of ordinary Palestinian citizens. Israel must immediately comply with calls from the international community to hold a thorough and transparent investigation into the killing of Ms Abu Akleh. It is vital that this case is addressed in the appropriate multilateral fora.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Ireland was actively involved in agreeing a statement at the UN Security Council condemning the killing of Ms Abu Akleh. This was the first statement by the Security Council on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since May 2021. It was a very significant statement which Ireland was actively involved in and we will continue to highlight this case. Ms Abu Akleh's family deserves justice and to see those responsible held to account. Additionally, at this time of heightened tensions, the authorities must do everything possible to ensure there is no further escalation of violence, particularly at potential flashpoints in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Ireland has condemned in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, as well as Belarus's part in it. We stand in unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine and media workers, a number of whom have been killed, including Pierre Zakrzewski, who was Irish. They work tirelessly to provide accurate and truthful accounts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ireland will make its voice heard to ensure that those responsible will be held to account and brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> As the Minister and Opposition Deputies mentioned, Ireland's role in the UN Security Council provides enhanced influence, as does our Presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. My first engagement with the UN Security Council, which was via a virtual meeting in January 2021, was on media freedom in Belarus, another very important issue. Our role on the Security Council, in the European Union and through the Presidency of the Council of Europe amplify our voice. If Ireland is elected to the Human Rights Council, I am sure we will be well placed to continue to protect all human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and press freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> It is clear from this debate that the Oireachtas stands four-square behind and in unwavering solidarity with all those who seek to protect journalists and promote media freedom. At the General Affairs Council, the issue of the protection of journalists within the European Union is of concern. Deputy Connolly mentioned the case of a journalist in Malta. There have also been reports on the murder of a journalist during an attack in Slovakia. The Slovakian Government is very concerned about that. There have been other cases, including in Ireland. We must ensure that journalists are protected. By giving us accurate information, they protect us.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> We very much appreciate Deputies' contributions today and assure them of the Government's continued determination to use all avenues available to protect journalists and press freedom, both in conflicts and elsewhere.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_457">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, for taking this debate. I also thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who contacted me earlier today as a courtesy to let me know he was unable to be present. However, as the Bill relates to a planning matter, it falls within the Minister of State's portfolio, so the right man is here for the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> As the Minister of State knows, in 2017, the Oireachtas committee on housing completed a report on the need to regulate short-term lettings. There was strong cross-party support for the introduction of a regulatory regime that would facilitate genuine peer-to-peer home sharing, particularly for people who wanted to let a room in their property for a number of weeks each year to supplement their income, support their mortgage payments, pay for school or college fees or even to pay for a holiday. The committee was strongly of the view that we needed robust regulation for commercial short-term lettings, those letting their property for more than 90 days or those letting second, third or fully commercial properties. That report received widespread public support and in 2019, the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Eoghan Murphy, introduced regulations that were broadly in line with the recommendations of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> While we broadly welcomed the regulations when they were introduced, a number of us highlighted a weakness, namely, that while their broad outline was correct, enforcement of the regulations would be a challenge. The regime the then Minister introduced was over-reliant on the planning enforcement of local authorities, which is slow and cumbersome and ultimately requires legal action. For this reason, we believed an additional layer of enforcement would be required for estate agents and letting platforms. It was my strong view at the time, and remains so today, that if somebody engages in the commercial activity of advertising a short-term letting, for example, an estate agent or online platform such as Airbnb, and profits from those advertisements, there should be a penalty if they advertise properties that do not have the exemption required for the genuine short-term letters or the required planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">It is important also to emphasise that the original regulations made a clear distinction. Short-term letting in rent pressure zones where there was a high demand for long-term lets would be discouraged, but beyond that, particularly in the more scenic parts of our tourist economy, it would be encouraged. Several years on, we know from the enforcement data that we were proved correct. The overwhelming majority of properties that are today listed, for example, on Airbnb, are illegal. They do not have planning permission. They do not have exemption certificates. Therefore, they are operating outside of the law, a law that had unanimous support across the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The Bill I am introducing today is a small, simple, but I think effective, tool to address that. Very simply, it will require any estate agent or short-term letting platform to require the host to give evidence that they have the exemption or the planning permission before they are allowed to be advertised. If any estate agent or online platform like Airbnb advertises properties and potentially profits from properties that do not have planning permission, they should be hit with a spot fine. I think the spot fine is the best way to do it, because the Minister could set a rate for a spot fine that would come in at or above the amount of money the platform would accrue if that property was let short term on a particular day. Spot fines could also be increased incrementally for serial offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> I wish to acknowledge the fact that in August 2021, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage did indicate he was working - or his hard-working, underpaid and undervalued officials in the planning section were working - on new regulations. He did not indicate at that stage that it may be a licensing regime by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. I would be interested to see if that is the case. I am sure that is probably not the direction of travel, and not the best one. I think enforcement is the key. Given that these companies, Airbnb in particular, are very large, wealthy global companies, the Oireachtas today should have a very clear message, namely, they should not be allowed to profit from, or facilitate, the advertising of properties that do not have requisite planning permission on the short-term letting market.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I wish to acknowledge the fact I understand the Government is not opposing the Bill. That is very welcome. My preference, of course, is that this Bill does not see the light of day. My preference is the Government accelerates its own changes, works collaboratively with us in opposition, and we get a speedy resolution on this. We did so with the USI student accommodation Bill both in this Dáil and in the previous Dáil. The commitment I give to the Government in exchange for its non-opposition to this Bill, if we can call it that, is if it works with us, we will assist it in speeding the passage of an appropriate and effective enforcement mechanism, crucially so that at this time, when the private rental sector is shrinking, we can ensure that properties should be in the long-term rental market are where they should be and not in an unregulated and illegal short-term letting market.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_465">I thank my colleague, an Teachta Ó Broin, for bringing forward this Bill and, as I have done previously, for all of the work that he does in the area of housing. It is a fairly simple, straightforward Bill requiring estate agents and online platforms, such as Airbnb and Daft, to advertise only those properties that are compliant with planning law. It also allows for the issuing of spot fines to Airbnb and other providers who advertise non-compliant properties. The situation where tens of thousands of houses and apartments that are non-compliant with planning laws are being advertised for short-term letting is an absolute disgrace. I am sure the Minister of State will agree it would be a disgrace at any time, but it is a particular disgrace now with the situation people find themselves in and the crisis people are facing. The law is in place and companies such as Airbnb are facilitating this non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The rental sector is in crisis. Renters need a break. It is time to get tough with these online platforms. Last week, I spoke to a 61-year-old woman who is living in her car in the Minister, Deputy O'Brien's constituency. If that is not going to set off some sort of flashing blue light emergency, I do not know what will. It is no way for people to live. We know there is a serious crisis there. As ever, Sinn Féin, as the lead party in opposition, is being constructive and offering solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Research conducted last week by <i>The Times</i> Ireland edition shows that Airbnb rentals now outstrip long-term rental homes in every single county. In Balbriggan, there are 165 properties advertised on Airbnb and just three available for long-term rental on Daft. Likewise, in Swords, there are more than 1,000 properties advertised on Airbnb and 11 available for long-term rental. It is not a case of a person renting out a room in their house short term. It is a case of people seeking to let out whole houses and apartments commercially all year round, but only on a short-term basis. These laws are being broken and nothing is being done, because local authorities are not monitoring to enforce compliance with the regulations. We have to get real here. We must get rid of this practice whereby people not complying with planning law are allowed to cause tens of thousands of possible rental homes to be taken off the market. I am not in any way surprised Airbnb is facilitating this kind of abhorrent behaviour because it is the same company that allows the advertising of properties in illegal Israeli settlements in the illegally occupied Palestinian West Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">I thank my colleague, an Teachta Ó Broin, for bringing forward this Bill. There is a crisis in the private rental sector, with rents continuing to spiral out of control. I listened to Newstalk yesterday and heard how the residents of an estate in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, received a knock on their doors in recent days to tell them their rent is going up by 70%. Imagine being told you have to find an extra €150 a week for rent. It is extortion, plain and simple. There are 12 rental properties in County Sligo currently advertised on Daft, and 563 advertised on Airbnb. Every month, the number of properties available to rent gets smaller and smaller. Last week, there were 32 properties available to rent in County Kildare on <i>daft.ie</i>. This week, there are 24. Just one of these properties is available at a rental cost within the housing assistance, HAP, limits. Meanwhile, there are 295 Airbnb properties available. In the meantime, the cost of renting a home is spiralling out of control. Rents are now even higher than at the highest point of the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The Bill is very simple and will be a most useful tool in ensuring the law is complied with. It is not about penalising holiday rentals. It is about maximising homes for need, not greed. If there are to be short-term rentals, they must be regulated. It is not just about Airbnb. Some landlords have been using <i>booking.com</i> and other sites to avoid the scrutiny of Airbnb. If there are elected representatives engaging in short-term letting, they should declare a conflict of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> In recent months there has been an explosion in the number of single people and families with children presenting as homeless. Notices to quit seeking vacant possession from landlords selling their properties now account for over half of all notices to quit. Many of these families do not qualify for social housing as they are just above the limits. The limits have not changed in many years. These families have been renting for years and never expected to be homeless. They have good jobs, but cannot afford the rents of up to €3,200 a month for a four-bedroom house, such as the one that has been advertised in County Kildare. This generation has been locked out of home ownership. This Government and previous Governments, including the Green Party and the Labour Party, are the reason for this. The Government cares more about the institutional investors and vulture funds than any ordinary worker and their family. When in government, we will change this.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">There is something fundamentally wrong with a housing system that sees families not in homes but in hotels, and tourists not in hotels but in homes. I refer to the survey published by <i>The Times</i> Ireland edition last week, which showed that Airbnb rentals now outstrip long-term rental homes in every county. The Minister of State and I share a constituency. A quick look at Airbnb shows that there are currently 94 properties available for short-term let, while Daft is advertising 12 for long-term let across both counties. That is before we get to the issue of affordability. It is clear further action is needed to regulate the short-term letting sector. The housing crisis is having a disastrous effect not only on our younger people starting out but on every single sector across the country. We all know of areas where large employers are buying up available properties simply to ensure their staff actually have somewhere to live. It is soul-destroying for those looking for a genuine home to see so many properties available to short-term rent for holidays while they are desperately trying to put a roof over their head for them and their family. Our rental sector is in crisis, renters need a break, and we need to strengthen the enforcement of the planning regulations for short-term lettings that were introduced years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> This Bill, while simple, will be effective because it will require estate agents and online platforms to advertise only those properties that are compliant with the planning and development regulations. It will also allow for the issuing of on-the-spot fines to Airbnb and other providers who advertise non-compliant properties. The Bill is not about banning genuine peer-to-peer home sharing. However, we cannot ignore the fact that further action is needed. We need stricter regulations to ensure the properties being advertised without exemptions or planning permission are removed from the short-term letting market and there is a real disincentive from doing so in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">It seems at this stage the Government is completely tone-deaf when it comes to the crisis in the rental sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I and, I believe, many people were shocked when they saw nothing was done in the budget for renters. I am equally shocked nothing has been done for renters since. We have a completely crazy situation in Galway city where there are in excess of 1,500 Airbnb properties to rent but only 44 places or properties to rent long term. That is greatly impacting on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> We also have a situation where the average rent is in excess of €1,500. A quick visit to an Airbnb website to tot up a month's rent for such a property will show it will cost more than €2,500 for a single room and in excess of €5,000 for an apartment. This shows the completely crazy situation in respect of Airbnb properties in Galway city.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The Minister of State is as aware as I am that notices to quit are through the roof in Galway at the moment. The Government inaction on this issue is having an impact on and messing with real people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I had a clinic yesterday and the Minister of State will know well that constituent after constituent who came into me raised the issue of housing. There are young families in bed and breakfast accommodation that is completely substandard, where black mould is growing and the mattresses are completely dirty. This situation exists but the appropriate laws are not being enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I hope the Minister of State will listen tonight to constructive criticism from the Opposition to ensure this law is passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I welcome the introduction of the Short-term Lettings Enforcement Bill 2022 and commend Deputy Ó Broin on his work on this issue. The rental sector, as we know, is in crisis and renters need a break, but unfortunately, as we see time and again, the Government is not listening. Sinn Féin has brought motions before this House to alleviate the pressure on renters by giving them a month’s rent back in their pockets, beginning a massive housebuilding programme and bringing forward many other measures to try to help deal with this housing crisis. The current short-term letting regime relies on a planning system and standard planning enforcement through the courts that can take a very long time to progress and resolve. This new Bill allows for the issuing of spot fines to Airbnb property owners and other providers who advertise non-compliant properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> This is something I raised time and again when I was a councillor on Fingal County Council. Nothing was done, however, because the council did not have the resources to enforce the law. A law that is unenforceable is a waste of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The figures at the moment in Dublin are completely staggering. A total of 2,704 properties are advertised on Airbnb while just 436 are available for long-term letting. In Blanchardstown, in Dublin West, there are more than 100 properties on Airbnb and only 30 properties available for long-term letting. It can be seen where the crisis lies and where the putting in place of a very simple measure can deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> While the purpose of the Bill is not to shut down short-term letting sites and platforms, it will make them more compliant and ease the availability of properties in the rental sector. Here is another opportunity for the Government to back renters and ordinary workers and families in this sector and show it is listening. I listened to the Minister on the radio yesterday when he said he was planning to bring forward legislation. As Deputy Ó Broin has said, we are ready and willing to work with the Government to get this sorted but, mark our words, this must be sorted. Families cannot wait any longer.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I thank an Teachta Ó Broin for bringing this Bill to the House and for his continuing work on the issue of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The current state of the rental market means we must do whatever we can to ensure as much supply as possible is available to the thousands of individuals and families who are in immediate need of accommodation. That is why we have brought forward a Bill that simply calls for the laws that allow property owners to rent their properties on short-term leases to be enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> In many counties, especially in my own county of Tipperary, rental properties that are available to rent are very few and far between. Families are being issued with notices to quit and are then facing a rental market where demand is outstripping supply to such an extent that many families who never considered homelessness as a likelihood are now finding that prospect to be a very real possibility. Many properties that are available to rent are of little use to these families as they are only available for short-term lettings, typically through Airbnb.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The number of properties in County Tipperary recently available on short-term lets on Airbnb outstripped the number of properties for long-term rent on <i>daft.ie</i> by a ratio of nearly 20:1. That gives us an idea of how many properties advertised for rent are not available to families who need long-term rental.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Under current law, namely, the Planning and Development Act 2000, if a person is letting out his or her property for less than 90 days a year, he or she requires a letter of exemption from the local authority. Any person letting a property out for 90 days of the year, or letting out a second property, needs planning permission or a change of use planning permission retention. This current short-term letting regime relies on the planning system and standard planning to be enforced by the courts. Figures released to Deputy Ó Broin earlier this year by a variety of local authorities show that the level of enforcement of and compliance with the regulations is exceptionally low.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Given the current state of the rental market and severe lack of suitable accommodation for thousands of people throughout the country, it is crucial that those property owners who comply with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 can make their properties available on short-term lets of 90 days or less. That is why we are bringing forward the Short-term Lettings Enforcement Bill to put stricter legislation in place to ensure estate agents and online platforms only advertise properties that are compliant with the planning regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Our legislation will also see the Minister giving local authorities the power to issue spot fines to short-term letting providers and estate agents who advertise non-compliant properties. This will act as a further disincentive for the advertising of properties that are breaking the law. It does not limit genuine peer-to-peer home-sharing but seeks only to ensure the laws are enforced that prevent unscrupulous landlords from reducing the long-term rental market by bypassing regulations. Renters need a break and every avenue must be pursued to do this.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterBurke" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_490">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill on behalf of the Government. As the House is aware, new arrangements to regulate the short-term letting sector under the planning code were introduced in July 2019. The principal aim of the legislation was to return much-needed accommodation being used for short-term letting purposes in the designated rent pressure zones, RPZs, to the traditional long-term rental market, thereby increasing supply in the long-term market and helping to stabilise rents in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> As has been outlined, Deputy Ó Broin's Bill comprises two amendments to the existing 2019 legislative provisions on short-term lettings: first, to make it an offence to advertise or let a house, or part of a house, in a rent pressure zone where that letting does not have the necessary planning permission or exemption, and second, to enable the Minister to make regulations permitting on-the-spot fines to be issued to persons, estate agents or online platforms that advertise or let properties for short-term letting purposes, contrary to the statutory provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> While the Government is not opposing Deputy Ó Broin's Bill and while also acknowledging it is well intentioned and has some merit, it is considered that amending the Planning and Development Act, as proposed, is not the most appropriate mechanism to achieve the goals set out in the Private Members' Bill. In this regard, I would make the following points. First, in light of the fact the current provisions, as operated by local authorities under the planning code, have not been as effective as envisaged, the Government has agreed a specific action in Housing for All, action 20.4, "Develop new regulatory controls requiring Short-Term and Holiday Lets to register with Fáilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that homes are used to best effect in areas of housing need". Officials from my Department and the Department with responsibility for tourism, along with Fáilte Ireland, have been working on new legislative arrangements to replace the current short-term letting provisions with a new registration system for short-term lets to be operated by Fáilte Ireland, which it is intended will become operational by early 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> While the precise details of the new arrangements remain to be finalised, it is envisaged they will incorporate somewhat similar proposals to those in Deputy Ó Broin's Bill in placing restrictions on the advertising of short-term letting properties by their owners or agents on online platforms as well as restrictions on the online platforms themselves, with associated penalties. These new arrangements will go further than what is proposed in the Private Members' Bill and will be easier and less cumbersome to enforce, with local authorities and the planning code no longer having any role in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> The proposal for the application of on-the-spot fines for non-compliance with the short-term letting provisions would be out of step with the existing approach and practice under the Planning and Development Act. On-the-spot fines are generally applied on routine minor offences with fairly nominal penalties. Planning offences are generally regarded as being more substantial, requiring conviction by the courts and the application of more substantial penalties, including fines, imprisonment or both,as appropriate. It is considered that such a departure from the existing approach under the Planning and Development Act would not be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">To give an example of the types of penalties that can be applied in this area, the courts just last week issued a fine of €1,000 to the owner of a short-term letting property in Dublin for operating without the necessary planning permission or exemption, with the €3,500 legal costs of the planning authority also being awarded against the property owner in question, in addition to the latter having to bear his own legal costs relating to the case. In any event, it is considered that the issuing of on-the-spot fines in this area could best be examined in the context of a new registration system to be operated by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, rather than such fines being introduced in the final months of the current short-term letting provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Like all Deputies across the political spectrum in the House, one of the key overriding priorities of the Government is to address the negative impacts of the current supply-constrained housing market on our society, particularly in those areas where housing demand is most acute. The proposed new registration system for short-term lets will be specifically targeted at assisting supply in the private rental market. The Government looks forward to the publication of the necessary underpinning legislative provisions in this regard in the coming months and their subsequent urgent enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> One of the key solutions to the current crisis is to increase supply, which is what the Government is singularly focused on doing. I listened to Deputies on the opposite benches, one after another, going through the situation in their various constituencies. That is what I deal with in my role and I see the huge constraint in supply. I held a clinic yesterday morning that was attended by a huge number of people in very difficult, vulnerable circumstances pointing out the lack of availability of rental supply. This is the first point I want to make in response to Deputies. As politicians, we are all dealing with the vulnerabilities of our constituents and trying our very best to respond to them as quickly as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Second, it is quite amusing to hear Deputies cite the huge supply constraint in their constituencies and then advocate for a refundable rental credit. That would put more fuel on the fire of a constrained marketplace and encourage prices to go up, which would affect the most vulnerable. Such an approach is diametrically opposite to the role of the help-to-buy scheme, for example, which incentivises supply of new properties and has enabled well over 20,000 families to get the keys to a new home. Looking at the current rental market, we see a situation whereby thousands of landlords, 85% of whom are renting out one property, have left the marketplace. The response to that from the Deputies of a certain party sitting opposite me is to tax those landlords more by imposing a second home charge, as set out in their party's pre-budget submission, of €400 on all second properties. All Deputy Ó Broin has to do is look at his party's pre-budget submission to see that proposal. It is a reflection of where Sinn Féin is coming from in respect of a market in which landlords who are renting out only one property and who are needed to secure tenure for renters are departing.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I will outline what the Government has done. We have introduced tenancies of indefinite duration in an effort to protect vulnerable renting citizens in our State. Second, we introduced a number of Bills throughout the Covid crisis to protect the most vulnerable and ensure people could stay in their tenancies at a time when a massive challenge faced the State. We also introduced new measures of tenure such as cost rental provision, which will be a huge asset in providing long-term, sustainable tenure below the market rate. This is key in assisting citizens to have security of tenure into the future. These measures are part of our singular approach, which is about driving up supply. If we look at the metrics in terms of the commencement notices that have been issued over the past year, we see that the constant trajectory is one of increased supply. There are diggers on sites and builders are constructing more homes to ensure we are within touching distance of getting to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, requirement of providing more than 33,000 homes per annum. I am very much aware that much more is needed, but our construction industry is trying to ramp up construction and deliver it at pace. The State is delivering record levels of social housing units through the local authority system, including by changing the delivery mechanisms, on which we are absolutely focused.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> When it comes to the vulnerable people I meet in my clinic every week, as I always say in this House, no one has a patent on compassion. We are all meeting vulnerable people every single week. That is why comments such as that we are putting vulture funds higher up the ranks than citizens do a total disservice to this debate. As a politician, where I am coming from is to try to do my very best in my constituency. I can look the people coming into my clinic in the eye and say there is huge hope. I can point to my town, where some 300 units are currently under construction, to show there is hope on the horizon. I know it is a very tough time at the moment but we are working from a low base to increase supply at pace. That is the way to a better future. We all need to work together, including on the Bill brought forward this evening, which I welcome. I want to be very clear that I welcome it. It is the comments that surround the debate and that are made for the social media clips with which I have an issue. Saying that we are placing a greater premium on a vulture fund than we do on the citizens we meet every week does a huge disservice to politics.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_501">I thank the Minister of State for his contribution, although I found some of it quite bizarre. It seems to be Government policy now to claim that every time we on this side of the House speak, it is about social media clips. I do not do social media clips, in fairness, but I do stand up for my constituents. As he said, we all have people and families coming to our constituency clinics who are in absolute distress. The homeless action team in Limerick is under massive pressure, with 80 notices to quit issued last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Government is losing control of the situation and we are in a crisis. A look at <i>daft.ie</i> shows there are ten properties available to rent in Limerick city. The monthly rental cost for a basic three-bedroom apartment in Dooradoyle, an area popular with families, is €1,600. Year on year, according to <i>daft.ie</i>, rental prices have increased by an average of 15.5% in Limerick city, with a three-bedroom house now costing nearly 13% more than it did this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> We in Sinn Féin have long argued that renters deserve a break. They deserve some security and to be paying less than some of the extortionate prices currently being charged. We have proposed a number of actions that could and should be taken to alleviate the stress on renters. The Minister of State has dismissed some of them but I will restate the ones I have raised in this debate and in other debates over the past two years. Our proposals include a three-year ban on rent increases and a rent rebate that would put one month's rent back into the pockets of hard-pressed renters and ensure greater security of tenancy for renters. We have proposed to resource the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to enforce the Government's rent regulations properly and introduce real tenancies of indefinite duration. There is a rental crisis and a lack of accommodation throughout the State. As of 1 May, the number of properties available for rent across the country stood at 851, which was a 77% year-on-year decrease. We have a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> In the short time remaining to me, I will speak briefly about the plight of residents in the Shannon Arms apartment complex in Limerick city, who are facing a most unscrupulous attempt to evict them in order that landlords' profits can be increased. These residents, many of them young families, are facing eviction. They have been treated in the most undignified way, with intimidatory tactics used and threatening letters issued. This is happening after some of the families have been at the location for more than a decade. Some of the tenants have already been bullied out, with their apartments apparently relet as short-stem stays to maximise profit. Given the lack of rental properties available in the city, many of the residents will be facing homelessness if an intervention is not made. Landlords in the complex, some of them well-known multimillionaires who often appear in the media, have placed the whiff of extra profit before their moral responsibility to their long-term tenants. As we are debating short-term lettings and a diminishing rental stock, I appeal to the Minister to intervene in this matter and ensure this community of families is protected from Dickensian-type landlord behaviour.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">There has been a significant reduction in the number of landlords offering new tenancies as rental costs have surged. According to the RTB, rental costs for new tenancies have risen by an additional 9% since last year. With the large volume of landlords leaving the rental sector each year, there is an acute shortage of properties for those looking to rent. Not only is it hard to find a place but, if they do, people find they have to spend a large percentage of their income on accommodation costs, with properties in Dublin North-West averaging at up to €2,000 per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> There is no doubt that Airbnb is having a detrimental impact on the limited available housing stock. The easy profits that can be made from short-term rentals are only going to encourage landlords to move their properties out of the long-term market. There is a consequence of this for the housing market that has been described as the Airbnb effect. It reflects the impact Airbnb has on local housing markets. This is increasingly a cause for concern, particularly in respect of housing stock and house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The growth in Airbnb, both here and abroad, is proving to be damaging for local housing markets. It will result in an increase in the value of an area to the detriment of locals who cannot afford to buy property where they grew up and where their families and communities reside. Locals are being pushed out of their own neighbourhoods due to financial constraints at a time when there is a dire need for affordable housing stock. An increasing number of properties are being advertised for short-term lettings and the number of such properties is far in excess of long-term rentals being advertised.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> There is also a concern that many properties are being advertised without proper planning permission or exemptions. The Bill being brought forward this evening by my colleague Deputy Ó Broin will ensure that those entering the short-term letting market are compliant with planning regulations. The Bill will amend section 38 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and will require estate agents and online platforms to only advertise properties that are compliant with the Act. This is an important step to ensure full compliance with planning regulations and will go towards preventing rogue operators operating in the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">I will start by commending my colleague Deputy Ó Broin on bringing forward this legislation. The Bill mainly stems from the report published in 2017 by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government which made unanimous recommendations for the then Government to regulate the short-term letting sector. It illustrated the economic and social impact of how Airbnbs that are let over 90 days per year artificially affect the supply of bona fide renter properties. The Short-term Lettings Enforcement Bill 2022 will regulate to that effect by requiring estate agents and online platforms not to advertise properties other than those that are compliant with planning regulations. It also allows for the issuing of on-the-spot fines to Airbnb and other providers that advertise non-compliant properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> This legislation comes at a time when the rental market is becoming a dysfunctional, out-of-control, money-grabbing industry. The latest Daft.ie report shows that my own county of Wexford saw an astonishing 14.2% year-on-year increase in rent. This is inflating and adding to the already high cost-of-living crisis currently being faced by working people and their families. They are facing extortionate energy costs, increasing carbon tax, rip-off insurance and soaring childcare costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> We know rents will continue to rise, causing more single people and families to return to their family homes to sofas or garages. Worse still, those who do not have that unfortunate option are facing the streets. Research recently conducted by <i>The Times</i> Ireland edition shows that Airbnb now outstrips long-term rental homes in every county. In Wexford, there are 490 properties advertised on Airbnb, compared to only 11 on Daft.ie. This is why constituency offices throughout the country, including mine, are inundated with people unable to secure rental properties for themselves and their families. The scarcity has created an unprecedented increase in rents that middle- and lower-income families just cannot afford. Urgent action to regulate the short-term letting sector is needed. All Deputies must have the courage to take on the rental crisis and the awful impact it has on our citizens and to do the right thing by supporting this Bill today.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">I happy to speak on this Stage and I commend an Teachta Ó Broin on this Bill. As a Deputy in north Kildare, where people are struggling to find a place to rent or to buy, I believe the boom in short-term lets exposes much of what is wrong with us in this State, politically and socially, because of a particular kind of political priority. This priority puts the desires and greed of the short-term market over the basic human needs of people, workers and families who are desperate to rent or buy a home. Both renting and buying are becoming impossible now when wealth funds hoover up developments and, in the latest development, developer risk is to be underwritten by the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Recent statistics show that Airbnb outstrips long-term lets in every county. This short-term market is putting the kibosh on workers completely. Quite simply, we have to give our renters a break. This Bill will do that, not by cajoling or asking nicely, but by using the law to fine agents and platforms that advertise properties without the appropriate planning permission or exemptions. Short-term lets would have to comply with the Planning and Development Act 2000 and where they did not, a spot fine would ensue. We simply cannot have people working harder and harder, in the vice of a cost-of-living crisis, only to find that people who use the short-term market are literally holding the key to a property that could be somebody's home.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> We have to get our priorities right, which means prioritising human and social need over market and corporate greed. As we know, figures that were released to my party colleague Deputy Ó Broin by local authorities in Dublin, Sligo, Cork and Galway showed an exceptionally low level of compliance with planning law when it comes to lets of under 90 days. It sticks in my craw, as a politician and a Teachta Dála for north Kildare, to see my constituents, some of whom are in their 60s, sleeping in their cars or sofa-surfing at this stage of their lives. The short-term let market has divided and now conquered the rental market. It is socially unacceptable and morally repugnant that our renters are treated in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I am taken aback by the contribution of the now departed Minister of State, Deputy Burke, when he said that the Government was not opposing the Bill. He said that while he acknowledges "that it is well intentioned and has some merit", he has something better up his sleeve, apparently for later. I heard Deputy Ó Broin on KFM this morning liken the current situation to hoarding food in a famine. It is exactly that. I cannot believe the number of notices to quit that are coming into my constituency office in the past two months. It is an absolutely hopeless situation. We are not enjoying this. We have plenty to be getting on with, without highlighting the crisis we are in. We are in a real crisis and it is time for change.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_516">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on the Short-term Lettings Enforcement Bill 2022. It is very important that we have a proper ventilation of this issue in the Chamber this evening. Nobody is making any overstated claims about the utility of the legislation. It is not a panacea but it certainly is a contribution to what is a very live debate and important issue across our society. The issue of short-term lets is one, as the House will know, that has been ventilated very prominently by my colleague Senator Moynihan, who is the Labour Party housing spokesperson. She has been especially prominent on this issue in recent times. We have called for stronger regulations and tougher enforcement on short-term letting. It is within that context that this Bill will receive our full support.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I note that the Government is not opposing the legislation. That is welcome but as we say repeatedly, probably every Tuesday and Wednesday night in this House and sometimes on a Thursday evening, about the Bills that surface through the lotto, that is not the same as proactively supporting the legislation. We know reforms are on the way, as the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, pointed out. They will be devised by Fáilte Ireland. I hope they will be devised in close co-operation with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Let us see how that evolves over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> We know that short-term rentals are a scourge for ordinary people seeking an affordable place to live. These are predominantly, but not exclusively, Airbnb listings. Of course, there are other platforms such as Booking.com. They are squeezing renters out and not only do they further limit the already short supply of available dwellings, they also significantly drive up rental costs. That is simply how the market works. The pandemic, as was articulated earlier on, saw a temporary shift of a good few thousand listings from short-let platforms to the home rental market. Combined with a ban on evictions and temporary rent freezes, which the Labour Party believes should be introduced for a period of three years, renters were given something of a respite and relief but that respite was all-too brief. The easing of public health restrictions has seen a return to what might be termed as "business as usual" in the rental market and many rental properties have been put back on the short-term letting market.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> We know and debate in this House every day the problems that constituents and citizens throughout the country are experiencing with ever-rising high rates of rent. It is evident throughout the country. There is no doubt that short-term letting is part of the problem. Analysis by my colleague Senator Moynihan, conducted in March this year, further proves this point. It showed that nearly all counties had significantly greater numbers of properties advertised for short-term stays on Airbnb than properties available on Daft.ie. In my county of Louth alone, there were three times as many properties available as short-term lets on the popular holiday accommodation website, Airbnb, than there were advertised on Daft.ie. There were 89 properties on Airbnb, compared to 29 on Daft.ie. I hope we would all agree that it is simply unacceptable in the middle of a housing crisis that in every single county except for Dublin, we have more houses for tourism that we do for rent. </p>
          <p eId="para_520">Not only have we seen crowding of residential properties by Airbnb and similar operators, but we have also seen an apparent failure by local authorities to properly enforce existing regulations. That goes to the heart of the proposals from Deputy Ó Broin this evening. The 2019 regulations simply are not working. I believe they were introduced with the best of intentions. Warnings were provided by Deputy Ó Broin's party and my party, including my former colleague, then Senator Kevin Humphreys, that the regulations were not sufficiently tight, but I accept that they were introduced with the best of intentions. There is acknowledgement at the heart of Government that they are simply not working. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has put that on record in the media. He may have said the same in this House. It is clear to us all that they are not working and this Bill is a response to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Twelve counties did not issue any warning letters last year regarding properties for short-term let that were not on the register, did not receive exemptions or did not have planning permission and 11 did not launch any investigations at all. Louth County Council is continuing its efforts to crack down on illegal short-term lettings and to promote suitable medium- to long-term accommodation. It is one of only 15 councils around the country which have taken action against property owners renting homes to holidaymakers as the housing crisis worsens. It has been relatively proactive in issuing 12 warnings and commencing 84 investigations last year, with, as the Minister will acknowledge, limited personnel available. We know this is just the tip of the iceberg. No local authority across the country can keep pace with the numbers streaming back onto the market, whether they are legal and registered, with planning exemptions and planning permission, or illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I will use the example of Carlingford. It is a beauty spot in County Louth that we are all proud of. It is, rightly, a haven for tourists. A constituent was in touch with me last month and was concerned about the levels of short-term lettings and the unavailability of rental properties. She informed me that there were only two properties to rent in Carlingford. It has been a rent pressure zone since 2019. One house and one apartment were available. There were 45 properties on Airbnb. I looked at the figures for County Louth before I came into the Chamber. While looking at Daft.ie is not scientific and does not provide a comprehensive picture of what is available to rent, it is a reasonable picture of what is available to rent and in Louth, there were 17 rental properties. Not a single property was available in my home town of Drogheda. Some 113 were available on Airbnb for the month of June. That puts this issue in context.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Carlingford urgently needs long-term housing solutions for the people who live there. Their housing needs should not come second to those who are spending a week, a weekend or the summer in what is admittedly a beautiful and welcoming area. We need to be conscious of that. Areas such as Carlingford are home to many hundreds of people. They are places that people value. I get many complaints from residents of the Carlingford area. While existing residents of the Carlingford area welcome the influx of tourists, which is important for the local economy, we always need to be conscious that generations of families have made that area their home and it is not simply a place to which people go on holidays. Looking at the places for rent on Daft.ie compared with Airbnb, one would wonder. That illustrates why we need practical regulation of this area. I mean regulation that will actually work and is balanced. The balance is key.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> As I said earlier, many local authorities are swimming against the tide when it comes to the regulation of short-term letting. They are not really sufficiently empowered to do it. We all know the 2019 legislation is not working. This Bill is designed to make it work better and to give the 2019 legislation some teeth, but we all know that planning, enforcement and housing departments across the country are chronically understaffed given the ambitions the Government has for housing, which are unfortunately not being realised. I would appreciate an update from the Minister of State in his concluding remarks, if possible, on what funding has been allocated by his Department to allow local authorities across the country to properly enforce the 2019 regulations and legislation. Will we simply wait for the Fáilte Ireland regulatory regime to be introduced in 2023? The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, said that is when he expects the Fáilte Ireland regulations to be operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I am happy to support this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. This legislation is an important contribution to the debate. I repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> in this Chamber that if we are to provide supply in a quick fashion, we need to focus on bringing vacant units in our town centres, which are serviced and can be brought back onto the market quickly, back into use. I fear, given the background noise in the media over the last few days, that we are being conditioned not to expect too much from the vacant homes tax that has been long-mooted and which the Labour Party has proposed for a long time.</p>

        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_526">I welcome this Bill. The Social Democrats will support it. I thank an Teachta Ó Broin for tabling it. The general thrust and approach is to place responsibility on the platforms that advertise short-term lets. They clearly have a key responsibility to ensure that in order to advertise, or accept an advertisement, they should have proof that it is planning compliant. That should have been done several years ago when these regulations were first brought in. We can have a good discussion on Committee Stage about whether the on-the-spot fines need to be broadened and so on. I strongly support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I hate to be the one to state the bleeding obvious. Giving the responsibility for this to Fáilte Ireland tells us everything we need to know about how seriously the Government takes this. The job of Fáilte Ireland is nothing to do with housing need or rental supply. It does not monitor that and has no responsibility in that regard. It is not what it does. It has never done that and will never do that. As everyone in the country knows, Fáilte Ireland has key responsibility for promoting and developing tourism in Ireland. It does not have an interest in regulating housing or rental supply. It never will have an interest in that and it will not do that. Its function is not to maximise the supply of rental accommodation, which clearly falls with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Fáilte Ireland has no remit whatsoever to look after that, which is our primary concern and why this Bill has been tabled. We know, from the fact that the Government has decided to give this serious responsibility for housing and rental supply to an agency with no remit whatsoever in that area, just how seriously the Government takes this. It does not take it seriously at all. This will not work. We know that from how the Government is approaching it. It is farming out an important job to another agency with no remit, particular interest or priority in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> One can tell how seriously the Government takes any kind of function by looking at who it gives it to. When the Government is really serious about collecting tax, it gives the function to the Revenue Commissioners. When it is not serious about regulating the building industry, it says that the people to regulate the building industry are the lobby group and representative group for the construction industry. We know, when it comes to tackling short-term lets and how they impact on rental supply, that the Government has looked at who is interested in maximising the number of short-term lets in the country and the accommodation for tourists and given the responsibility to Fáilte Ireland. The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has departed. It appears from his comments that the Government intends to bring in a loose licensing system to be operated by Fáilte Ireland for short-term lets.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We certainly have not got any detail in the comments indicating that there would be anything beyond some sort of loose licensing system. If that is not the case, I ask the Minister of State to give us details as to how this would be a robust system. If it is a robust system, why has it been given to an agency that has no remit in this in terms of rental or housing supply? Why on earth is the Government taking that approach to something so important that needs to be dealt with urgently?</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> Not only does Bord Fáilte have no remit in this area; it is not the body monitoring housing demand around the country and will never be. It is monitoring tourism figures. That is its bottom line, to ensure the maximum number of tourists. That is absolutely at odds with trying to have balance in short-term lets and how they impact on reducing rental supply. Why is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage relinquishing its responsibility in this and giving it to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Bord Fáilte? Have any of the short-term letting companies been involved in lobbying on or devising what I consider to be at best an incredibly ineffective scheme? It is not going to work. If we were being cynical, we would think it has been designed to fail, potentially at the behest of industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> On tourism and the effects of short-term lets, not only do they effect people in their ability to rent and people who need a home; their dominance at this point is actually undermining the development of tourism in certain areas. People who want to work in key tourism industries and are looking to rent cannot do so because of the dominance of short-term lets in tourism areas. Even they are now facing pressure and it is causing problems for smaller businesses and employers. It is so unbalanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> What is happening with short-term lets is symptomatic of a broken housing system. Housing has been turned into a financial commodity and an asset. The people's needs in terms of a home are secondary to where people can make the best return. If we do not regulate short-term lets properly and protect rental supply, of course people are going to go where they can get the best returns. If they can make more money off short-term lets they will move to that. They have been moving to that and out of long-term letting of properties which gives people the ability to have a home and provides much-needed accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> We should be looking at best practice internationally on this. We should be looking at cities like Amsterdam, for example, where a ban on short-term lets was brought in in parts of the old city and canal area in 2020. They also brought in a very strong regulation system with that. Following the overturning of the ban in March 2021, they brought in legislation in November 2021 which provided that anyone buying a home for under €512,000 must be an owner-occupier and must live in the house for four years. They put in strong measures to protect their rental accommodation and their housing stock against this over-speculation and dominance.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I want to respond to some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, before he departed. He accused Opposition parties of adding fuel to the fire in terms of housing supply. Government policy is very much adding fuel to the fire. The Government is now spending more than €1 billion in subsidies going to investment funds and private landlords that are pushing up rents. That is going through long-term leasing and the HAP and RAS schemes. It is the same Government that is adding fuel to the fire through the favourable tax treatment and tax incentives for investment funds. It is the same Government that has decided in its wisdom to add fuel to the fire by giving €450 million in subsidies to developers and by guaranteeing their profit margins as part of those subsidies while at the same time removing a substantial amount of risk. That risk was part of the justification for the profit margins of those developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> It is simply not true to say that we have tenancies of indefinite duration. That is absolutely not the case. I find it disturbing if that is really what the Government believes. If it really believes its own spin on this, things are worse than I thought they were. A tenancy of indefinite duration as exists in other countries means that if a tenant is paying rent, is compliant and is not engaged in antisocial behaviour or anything like that, he or she is not subject to eviction. That is not the situation here. There is a long list of reasons that are used to evict people from their homes here. It is very welcome that we now have some cost rental in Ireland. Comparing cost rental in Ireland to other countries or to the Vienna model, though, the rent on a two-bed newly built apartment in the city in Vienna is about €660 per month. We are looking at double that sort of rent in cost rental in Ireland. One of the reasons for that is that a lot of the cost rental has been sourced from private sources. We are building in the private profit margins and high financing risks as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_536">I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett. Staggering profits are being made from short-term letting in the midst of the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State. According to the online publication, Tripe + Drisheen, citing the AirDNA website, a five bedroom house on the south side of Cork city yielded €71,400 income through Airbnb last year. According to the same sources, a two bedroom house on the south side of Cork city yielded an Airbnb income last year of €47,500. Long-term rental rates in Cork city are scandalously high and are pricing ordinary people out of the market. These short-term letting rates are a multiple of the long-term rates and are making their owners a fortune at the ultimate expense of people trying to find a place for themselves and get a roof over their heads, many of whom are ending up homeless. Little wonder that the ratio of short-term letting to long-term leases on entire houses, not just rooms, in Cork city is 17:1. The ratio for Cobh and Youghal in County Cork is 55:1. The vast majority of short-term lettings in Cork city and county are taking place in defiance of the planning laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I support the Bill because it makes that an offence and gives the power to the Minister with responsibility for housing to make regulations permitting the issuing of spot fines to persons, estate agents and online platforms. These spot fines should be sufficiently hefty to act as a strong and powerful deterrent. If and when this Bill is passed, extra resources must also be provided to local authorities to allow them to follow up and enforce the new powers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_538">I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing forward this Bill, which we support. When in Dublin there are 2,700 Airbnb short-term lets being advertised but only slightly over 400 long-term lets, we know the Government's policy is failing yet again. Despite some efforts being made to limit or regulate this area, they just have not worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Those who are pursuing profit from property are simply ignoring the rules, and we do not have a regime to do anything about it. These measures will at least attempt to address that problem. I refer to forcing estate agents or platforms that advertise short-term lets to at least try to establish whether they are within the planning regulations. I refer also to the establishment of the power to issue spot fines to those that do not do so or that offer short-term lets that are not within the law. I agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> We need to go further, however, because there is an emergency. This House agreed some time ago that we have a housing and homelessness emergency, but we just do not act accordingly. The Government most certainly does not although it pays lip service to it. An emergency means you do unprecedented things to address it. Not doing so is obscene and immoral in the teeth of this crisis. If we had a functioning housing sector and did not have 10,000 households in emergency accommodation, 20-year waiting lists for social housing and rents and house prices that the vast majority of working people cannot afford, we could operate in a different way. However, in the teeth of the incredible suffering that people are going through, we need emergency measures. Deputy Cian O’Callaghan is right that in the epicentre of the housing crisis, there simply should not be short-term lets available. They should not be allowed when we need people, including families and children, to be housed properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Let me raise the case of a woman whose case I have raised many times. Hers is one of many cases but I am referring to it again because I received a text from her today. She told me how her youngster, who is 11 years old, is now seeing a psychological counsellor to assess the impact on his mental health and his trauma because the family is three and a half years in emergency accommodation. She has been thrown off the housing list because her income is too high. She is not even entitled to the housing assistance payment now and her child is being damaged. That there are others making money out of short-term lets when this family needs a place to live is just obscene. We need emergency measures. If we had a functioning housing sector in which the State had built a sufficient amount of public and affordable housing, we might operate in a different way; however, in the face of an emergency, you have to do unprecedented things. We need to start doing them. Short-term letting should not be allowed, full stop, in the areas where the housing crisis is focused, which is in the major urban centres, including Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Seeing as we are talking about advertising, let me highlight something else. The development up in Cherrywood really drives me insane because it is the biggest residential development in the State. It is basically a new town. The State put in the Luas. The site is off the N11 and millions of euro have been spent on infrastructure. For a brief period, the development was in public hands, in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, but we flogged it off to developers and speculators. Finally, more than a decade later, housing is starting to appear there. There are apartments and so on. An outfit that was drawn to my attention this week – Hali, which has offices on Mount Street – is advertising studios for €1,500 and single-bedroom apartments for €1,800, going up from there. They are not exactly cheap. It gets worse, however. With regard to Cherrywood, two people came to me this week. Both are working and on reasonably decent incomes. One, a young woman, is earning €3,000 per month and does another job for which she earns another €500 or €600. The other, a man, is in the same boat. The two emailed Hali and said they wanted to rent one of its apartments. Hali said it was pre-approving them. Later, after months of emails, they were told they were progressing brilliantly, that it was all looking good and that they should just send in their bank documents, and this and that. At the end of the process, however, this crowd just turned around and said it was not giving them the apartments. There was no explanation whatsoever and the people affected are absolutely gutted because they are so desperate. They looked up one of the directors of the company and saw that, in a tweet or post, Hali referred to how it was very glad to be doing work with big corporations to house their talent in some of their apartments. It is a new twist to the housing tale that the apartments are being let <i>en masse </i>to big corporations that gazump ordinary individuals who have been engaging in good faith to try to rent them. They are gazumped because the company is interested only in money. That is the problem with our whole housing policy. Irrespective of whether short-term lets or this kind of behaviour is in question, these companies cannot be let dictate what happens in our housing sector and the availability of rental property. The State has to dictate.</p>

        <speech by="#VeronaMurphy" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the issue. When it comes to housing, the various rules, regulations and proposals being debated by the Government and the main Opposition party are, as the saying goes, like “two bald men fighting over a comb”. I do not have a great deal of confidence that either side is identifying the root causes. The Bill deals with what I would describe as cosmetic issues given that the crucial issues are more structural and need to be the focus of our attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> The housing situation has been allowed to deteriorate over the past 15 years or so owing to a series of poorly designed regulations and Government interventions, which in their totality seem to have made the overall problem even worse. The latest plan to award developers grants is yet another white-elephant solution. A developer with an apartment where demand is expected, such as Cork city, will receive a grant, yet a developer in Cork county will not. What is the aim of the policy? Is it to stop developers from going out of business? Is it to ensure the apartments get completed? Perhaps it is both. Why, then, should it matter where the apartment is located? That the Government has now deemed it necessary to provide such heavy subsidies for the construction of apartments in the areas with the greatest demand should be a major wake-up call when it comes to the types of dwellings that are being pushed by planning authorities and county councils via the local development plans. If they cannot be built and sold in the areas with the highest demand without the Government having to subsidise them, what hope is there for those forced to build high-density dwellings in areas of low or no demand?</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The main cause of the problem is the planning regulations. If a developer wants to build in Wexford, it will be told by the planners that there must be 35 dwellings per hectare, as is soon to be enshrined in the county development plan. The demand for those types of units in Wexford town is very low and therefore a developer will not risk a major investment under such conditions. Apartments are very costly to build by comparison with houses. If there is no demand, why would they be built in towns like Wexford?</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Back in June 2020, I had an exchange with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on the issue of density requirements. I will repeat what I stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_547">The issue of minimum density at the edge of town and greenfield sites has caused significant problems outside of the M50 concerning the supply of housing. The imposition of such densities necessitates the construction of apartments at locations where they are just not viable. The application of these densities by An Bord Pleanála is unlawful and it undermines the statutory standing of every county development plan, as no specific minimums have been set out in the specific planning policy requirement, SPPR, or in the ministerial guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">After a bit of tooth-pulling, I eventually managed to extract from the Minister of State confirmation that there are no minimum density requirements, despite An Bord Pleanála applying minimum density standards of its choosing. We now see the executives of county councils being contacted by the regulator. He is also imposing minimum densities, despite the Minister of State's confirmation that they do not exist. This regulator is a zealot and seems to be a law unto himself. The typology of houses built at higher densities is not what is required. There is not sufficient demand for such housing in rural constituencies. People want family homes with front and back gardens, not ghettos, as they will become.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Leaving aside the planning regulations, we need to look at other Government actions and how they worsen the problem of cost. Many Government regulations have resulted in dramatic increases in the cost of housing, increased transport and labour costs, increased carbon tax, the stagnation of our forestry industry for timber due to poor administration, extra regulations on material types, insurance increases, etc. All of this affects the cost at which a builder can construct a house. That extra cost naturally gets passed on to the buyer. The cause-and-effect relationship of Government decisions does not seem to be given near enough thought. There are a few Government supports for first-time buyers, such as the help-to-buy scheme with its €30,000 maximum grant. If a first-time buyer wants to ultimately live in a standard house with a bit of space like a garden, why would they waste all their first-time buyer's grant on a small apartment in an area in which they do not want to live? It is unattractive for a couple who want to start a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> An article by Fiona Reddan in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday explains why very few people are buying apartments as their forever home and how they are built with the buy-to-rent sector in mind. It is worth a read because she spoke to real people. We need to build dwellings people want in the places they want to live. It should not be based on the Planning Regulator going on a personal crusade to enforce his version of planning laws and Joe Public or Cork County Council having to take judicial review proceedings to put him back in his box. </p>
          <p eId="para_551"> There are many advantages to living in rural areas but the Government places barrier after barrier in the way of many people. It wants to herd everyone into high-density apartment blocks with no transport infrastructure to support them. Many rural Government Deputies no doubt live in beautiful rural detached homes set on half an acre, where they raise their families with the support of close-knit communities, with family up the road and lifelong friends next door. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a great way to live. How many Deputies would happily swap that for a poky apartment with no garden on the outskirts of their local town? I would say few of them would be pleased about that prospect, yet many of them are happy to impose this Hobson's choice on our young people. When young people eventually gather up enough money and meet all the criteria to qualify for a mortgage, they might find themselves in competition with the local authority to buy an affordable house. </p>
          <p eId="para_552"> This Bill is another example of focus on the wrong problem. I do not see the practical problem this Bill would solve. In fact, it may serve to reduce the number of properties available for let in zones which are already under serious pressure. It might solve a technical administrative problem but it will not make things easier for people looking for somewhere to live on a short-term basis. This comes back to my point about the two bald men fighting over a comb. It is foolish to continue to regulate when each regulation is making the problem worse. An Bord Pleanála thinks it is above the law, the officials think they are working within the law and the Planning Regulator, Mr. Cussen, does not know the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The Government approach to housing regulations is like Father Ted trying to fix the dent in the car. With every attempt to solve the problem by tapping at the dent, he is inadvertently making it worse until the car is so broken that it is almost unrecognisable. That analogy perfectly illustrates the current mess the housing market is in. We need to stop tapping at the dents of our housing crisis and rethink our whole approach to the issue. Let us start from the bottom up - with planning. There is a major demand for housing and usually when there is a major demand for something, the free market will spur into action and meet it. However, the problem with housing is that the market is not being allowed to operate and is being restrained by the Government's ambiguous legislation, county councils' maladministration and the regulator's legal interpretations. Start here and stop blaming those who are trying to right the wrongs.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_555">I thank members of the Rural Independent Group for allowing me to speak ahead of them on this by way of exception. I appreciate that. I agree with Deputy Verona Murphy on a number of issues, but certainty not on the Planning Regulator and the manner in which he has been portrayed. It ignores how the Planning Regulator's role arose. It was because of a planning tribunal that cost a fortune, went on for years and found systemic corruption at every level of the planning process. Perhaps I am misquoting a little bit, but that was the gist of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I agree with the Deputy that there is a housing crisis but disagree that the market is being inhibited and cannot get its chance to provide. It is because the market has been given free rein that we have a housing crisis. There is no other explanation for it. We handed everything over lock, stock and barrel to the market to provide and it utterly failed to do so. We have changed housing from a human right and the most basic necessity into a commodity to be traded on the market. Unfortunately, Fine Gael and the Labour Party copper-fastened that in 2014 or 2015 when they enshrined the housing assistance payment in our legislation and said there was no other game in town. That was the language used at Galway City Council. Encapsulated and enshrined was that if you were on HAP, you were then appropriately housed. That was the market getting full ownership of the Government's responsibility to provide public housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I agree with the motion brought by Sinn Féin. Once again, I find myself thanking that party for bringing it. It is bringing in a Bill to amend the Planning and Development Act and to allow for the enforcement of existing legislation and regulations on short-term lettings which are not being enforced. I know the Minister of State has inherited a situation but can he imagine that Sinn Féin, and we are supportive of this, is introducing basic legislation because the existing regulations are not being enforced? What kind of a farcical situation is this? The regulations were brought in on foot of a report by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018. It made 13 recommendations for the then Minister to regulate the short-term letting sector. The 19 regulations were introduced on foot of that. Also recommended was that a study of the impact of short-term letting on Ireland's housing and rental market be commissioned. It was commissioned and that study recommended that we needed further research.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Whether this legislation is wrong or right and sorts out the problem or does not, we have no choice but to support it because it puts the focus on the madness of what has been created. If the Minister of State has any say, let us go back to what the problem is here, as with climate change. When the National Parks and Wildlife Service was set up, it was determined that it would fail. It was under-resourced, under-financed and demonised, just like the Planning Regulator is being demonised. We are ignoring what has happened. When we looked at climate change we set up the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which should have been the focal point, but it was left under-resourced and so on. When we then go to housing, we see we have a jigsaw and we bring pieces in. During Covid we were supposed to have a fundamental change and brought in some measures protecting tenants. They are all gone now. </p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I turn to the CEO of Galway City Council. I never knew why we had to change from managers. I believe a city council is there to serve and a manager is there to manage those services. We have gone down the corporatisation road on everything and now we have a CEO. He stated in an update to councillors on 16 May that some 2,000 private landlords were leaving the rental market in Ireland every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Half of them are issuing notices of termination because they are selling the property. "The exodus of private landlords from the rental sector is being mirrored in Galway City with the latest figures showing that 37% of Notices of Termination issued ... [and so on] are for the purposes of sale with the consequent further depletion of private rented stock." It goes on and on. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> Karina Timothy, the western regional services manager for Threshold, stated in a local newspaper that the rental market was at crisis point and unsustainable. She pointed out that, theoretically, Galway city and several other areas are rent pressure zones. Theoretically, there should not be an annual rent increase of above 2%. She stated it was clear from the report showing double-digit rent rises that the zones were not working. As regards County Galway outside the city, it is clear that rents are rising even more rapidly there. Yesterday or the day before, I heard of a four-bedroom house for rent in County Galway and asked people to guess what was the rent for that house. They guessed it was €1,500 or €1,800. The rent is nearer to €3,000. That is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> We have reached a stage where what has been created is an obscenity. I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is present, for that but I will blame him if he does not stand up and say that he will not be part of the proposed solution that is market-driven and creating the problem. I will support him if he stands up and says that. It is time for change, just like it is time for change in the context of having learned from Covid. We need fundamental and transformative change in respect of climate and housing. The primary message is that having security is the most fundamental aspect of a democracy, but we do not have it in Ireland. A person very close to me whom I will not name - he or she would not thank me for doing so - may be homeless next week. Fortunately, I might be able to pick up the pieces a little bit, given that I am earning a salary. I am using this as an example. That person is expected to put on a suit and go into work but he or she has no place to stay from next Tuesday. There is no place to get in the cities of Dublin or Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Let us look at the Locked Out of the Market report published by the Simon Community. I tire of quoting from it but it is my duty to do so. "The Simon Communities of Ireland’s quarterly Locked Out report shows yet another stark decline in the availability of affordable properties." One property was available within the HAP limits and it was in the suburbs of Galway. There were no properties in Galway city centre. There is €280,000 to deal with homelessness in Galway city and county. Government expenditure on HAP, RAS and leasing is more than €1 billion. Is the Minister of State aware that when I and other Deputies on this side of the House repeatedly tried to raise the issue of HAP rising continuously, we were laughed at? HAP should go. Obviously, it cannot go tomorrow, but it has to go. It is artificially keeping the market sky high.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Evictions are increasing. It is all here in this information from Focus Ireland. I pay tribute to Rory Hearne on his continued analysis of the situation. One in four children in Ireland, or 281,000 children, is growing up in the private rental sector. These children are in precarious and insecure living conditions. Obviously, that is very stressful and leads to all sorts of development regression. It is even more challenging for children with special needs. Half of all one-parent families are in poverty after they pay their housing costs. Half of all one-parent families are renting.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> I refer to the Aran Islands. A person wrote to me to say he or she would love to stay on one of the Aran Islands. There are no properties available there. There are no properties in Ceantar na nOileán. There is house after house, however, left derelict. There is no policy for the islands yet. In 2019, with the help of the Dáil, we passed a motion for a policy for sustainable living on the islands. That policy has not yet come to pass. We are still being told it is coming. I gCeantar na nOileán, i gcroí-lár na Gaeltachta, tá neart foirgnimh agus tá siad ag titim as a chéile. Tá scoil á dúnadh i Leitir Calaidh, tá cinneadh déanta ag an mbord bainistíochta agus tá daoine as an Úcráin ag iarraidh cur fúthu cibé cén áit is féidir leo seilbh tithíochta a fháil ach níl tithíocht ar fáil. Níl an chosúlacht ar an scéal go bhfuil aon rud ar siúl ag an Rialtas ach Sinn Féin agus na daoine atá ar an taobh seo den Teach a mhaslú seachas seasamh suas agus a rá go bhfuil ciall cheannaithe aige agus nach féidir linn leanúint ar aghaidh mar sin. Instead, we get ridiculous back-and-forth comments that I will not even repeat.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> We have a housing emergency. It must be declared and appropriate action must be taken to right what has happened. That can only be done with acknowledgement. The Minister stood there earlier and asked for our co-operation. I will give him none. His ideology is to the private market. If the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, stands up and tells me his ideology is practical - to provide public housing on public land - he will have my absolute 100% support, but that is not what has been said and I am tired of the duplicity and hypocrisy of the language being used.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_567">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I thank Sinn Féin, and Deputy Ó Broin in particular, for affording us this time to speak on housing. Certainly, housing for people who do not have homes is very important. We need to discuss all aspects of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I do not agree with the Bill. It is basically a Bill for Dublin rather than one for rural Ireland. Maybe it is a more dominant issue for Dublin than it is for rural Ireland. The Bill will not sort the problem we have with housing. The way to sort the problem is to build more houses and to keep doing so. The local authorities should be afforded money to build houses, like they always did in the past, rather than having all these other schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> In Kerry, we are glad that in the past few days several houses have come on stream in Killarney. We thank Kerry County Council for building those houses in a very short time. They are very welcome indeed. I thank the likes of Michael Cronin - or Mike Jack, as we call him in Kerry - for all the houses he has built in Killarney and Milltown for Clúid. We should also recognise the great work KPH Construction is doing in Barraduff. More funding needs to be given to local authorities, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I will take one aspect of housing in Kerry that is under pressure. There are so many voids but the local authority is not getting the money to turn them around. When the tenant purchase scheme was operating properly, the money Kerry County Council got from selling a house to a tenant went straight into voids. That is not happening any more because the tenant purchase scheme was not fit for purpose in the first place, with the 80% figure. Even the new tenant purchase scheme is not a proper scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Many landlords do not want to let long term for various reasons. Between finding or building a house and paying for it, there is a lot of trouble involved in acquiring a house. It should surely be the right of the person who owns the house to do whatever they want with it. They may want to let it for a few months in the short term. I know many landlords or people who own houses who rent them for a few months and are glad of the few bob. I met a couple the other day who are letting their property for the legal 90 days. They are going to live with her mother for the 90 days. They are letting the house because they want to put money aside to send their youngsters to college. God almighty, they should not be stopped from doing that. They are a very respectable and honourable couple but they were encountering problems with letting the house. I hope it is sorted now.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The visitors who come to rural Ireland for a few months mean a lot to the local economy in rural places such as Gneevguillia, Scartaglin and Kilgarvan.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">It boosts the local pub or shop. That means something. We should not deprive those people of that. The other thing is these visitors want to experience rural areas. They perhaps left cities and hotels and gave half their life living in those very bright-light urban areas and want to experience a local place. If we hurt those people who operate what they call this Airbnb system, it would be wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The other thing is that a Bill like this is not enforceable. On asking the local authorities to monitor this, I know and respect the local authority we are dealing with in Kerry and they have enough to do. Their outlook should be to provide housing and that is what they want to do, rather than monitoring this situation and sending out enforcement letters and whatever. They have enough to do besides doing that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_575">First of all, I thank Deputy Ó Broin and Sinn Féin for bringing forward this Bill. The legislation contained within this Bill would require estate agents and online hosting platforms to check if property owners have the correct planning documents before advertising their properties on their websites. If not, the law would then mean the platforms would be fined the amount they would earn per day from the property being rented out from their website.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I know Deputy Ó Broin will not mind me saying this. He is extremely proactive in this whole issue, and I very much respect all of the hard work and commitment he has put into his role. I do not always agree with everything he proposes, and he knows that. At the same time, I support his work ethic in regard to this. The one thing he is trying to do is what the rest of us want to do. We want to ensure we have a situation where there are enough properties available for people who need them, whether they are to purchase or the local authority is providing them. However, at times, we may have to agree to differ on how we do that, because we are not all the same. I could not agree all the time with Sinn Féin’s policies when it comes to housing quite simply because I do not believe they are achievable in the way Sinn Féin wishes to do them. It would be great if they could be, but I just do not agree they can be done practically.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I see where the Deputy is coming from with this proposal and it is only giving legal effect to what is there already and making it more easily enforceable. However, I am always concerned about what I call the undermining of people’s property rights. I am acutely aware of what Airbnb is doing to places in County Kerry. On one hand, we might say we want it, but on the other hand, it is making it impossible. For example, if we take a place such as Dingle, which we all adore, it is terribly difficult for those working there in the hospitality sector or any other type of job to get a place to put down their head at night. It is terribly difficult not just in Dingle but throughout County Kerry and in other parts of the country. If you are a worker going to place and you want a flat, apartment, house or house to share, you practically cannot get it or you definitely cannot get it at an affordable price. That is wrong. We should be catering for all different sectors of society when it comes to their housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> However, we just have to be careful of one thing. I keep saying this and I will continue to do so because I want people such as those in Sinn Féin to follow this. I know they do not want to do harm to the housing sector, but what I see happening practically on the ground is people saying they will not be told what to do with their property anymore, so they sell it. When it is sold, it has gone from the rental market and it makes the problem worse. There are terribly genuine people here in the Dáil who are just doing what they consider to be right, but it actually could have the opposite effect. I know the Minister and the Government are acutely aware of that. I know the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is too because I have heard him speak about it and I have spoken to him about what I would call the exodus out of the whole rental market. We have to try to stop that because it will not benefit anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> On this whole thing about how it is wrong for people to rent out and charge exorbitant rents, the first thing we have to do is always remember that, whatever type of renting is being done, it is the people here in this House who are taking over half of it in tax. If people are paying €1,000 a month in rent, the Government is taking half of that €1,000. The Government cannot be giving out about it, because it is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the money that is being paid in rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> We have to tackle this problem from the ground up and not be aspirational about it. We have to be sensible about what we are doing and not drive people out of the market. We have to ensure there are properties are available for short-term lets because we want people to go into areas such as Killarney, around the Ring of Kerry, Killorglin, Cahersiveen or Kenmare, or all of the parts of north Kerry. I give that example only because it is the county that I am charged to represent, but it also applies to the rest of the country. We do not want to send out a message that we are driving the operators of Airbnb or short-term lets out of that business and we do not want them anymore. Of course we want them, but we want them to operate in a balanced way and in a way they are not taking over from everything else and making the problem worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Again, I thank Deputy Ó Broin, because what he is trying to do is a thing called his best, and you cannot be blamed for that.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_582">I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing forward this Bill. I agree with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that Deputy Ó Broin consistently brings forward legislation that at least sparks a debate and is very much trying to contribute positively towards this very important issue. For this reason, the Government will not be opposing this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I might try to just address some of the points raised by Members before I sum up. I refer to that last point raised by Deputies Healy-Rae. What the Government is proposing around the legislation and working in collaboration with Fáilte Ireland on will benefit the rural tourism sector as well as dealing with that challenge around short-term lets and properties that should be in the long-term rental sector and trying to tease that out. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I have a friend who has a fantastic rural tourism product down in Ballycullen at the foothills of Slievenamon. He is very much largely reliant on short-term lets and their platforms for his business. By far the bulk of his trade is coming from there. It is supporting the types of projects such as Croc an Óir, which has converted farmhouse and brings income into rural tourism economies. That is what the Government is going to do and to benefit as well as address this issue of the enforcement around short-term lettings. It is very much a collaboration between the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and our Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I wish to address a number of the other points raised by Deputy Connolly, in particular the issue around the market leading. Since the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, has taken office, he has consistently led, through Housing for All, on the delivery of social and affordable housing and empowering and resourcing local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver on social, affordable and cost rental housing. No other Government has given that level of commitment hitherto. There has been a marked change and it can be seen on the ground with the opening of many new housing projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Like Deputy Connolly, I want to take issue with the point raised by Deputy Verona Murphy on the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR. The OPR is very well up to speed on planning law and it was a disgraceful comment. The regulator is there to perform a very important function in terms of planning in this country, and those comments were out of order.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the issue of the large urban centres. However, as we have heard all Deputies contributing this evening, this is an issue that is affecting regional towns such as Sligo, Drogheda and Wexford and throughout the country. It is not just the larger urban centres. It is something that we are committed to dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> On the points raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan around the responsibility of Fáilte Ireland, as I said, it is a collaboration between both Departments. While the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has the lead responsibility, it is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in engaging on the progression of our own legislation. While Fáilte Ireland will enforce the registration of its system with the matters pertaining to planning permission, enforcement will remain the responsibility of local authorities. This is an important way forward. We have looked at other jurisdictions, particularly France, where there is a similar precedent for this type of approach. It is important to say it is a system we are basing on those of other jurisdictions. We are not relinquishing responsibility, especially around the rental market, cost rental supply and rent to buy. The Government is keenly committed to being still very much in control of how we manage these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Deputy Nash raised the point that it is not the same as proactively supporting legislation. We are supporting this, and I am making positive comments in that regard. The Deputy also asked about resourcing local authorities for the implementation of existing regulations that are still in place until the new legislation comes into effect and will be part of it. The resources we have put in place, an additional €2.5 million in this year's budget, are significant. Notwithstanding that there have been challenges around under-resourcing for local authorities' enforcement, the issue of enforcement around gaining access to properties is adding to the challenges that have existed to date. We are trying to achieve the separation of genuine short-term lets for the tourism sector from speculative short-term letting where there are rent pressure zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> While supporting Deputy Ó Broin's Bill, the Government is determined to pursue legislation that will go a long way towards trying to address these problems. We must consistently adapt and be in a position to respond continually as we see whether legislation is working in the way we hoped it would initially. I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing this Bill forward and for the useful debate we have had in the House on it this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> In the current housing supply shortage situation, which has been further exacerbated by the recent influx of citizens fleeing the war in Ukraine, increasing the supply of housing across all sectors of the housing market, be it private housing, social and affordable housing, long-term private rental housing as well as addressing vacancy, is one of the key challenges and priorities faced by Government. Every possible mechanism to increase housing supply is being examined on an ongoing basis, as is evidenced by the comprehensive suite of actions contained in Housing for All.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> The long-term private rental market is a key element of the overall housing market and has been negatively impacted by a significant number of properties that have moved from the traditional long-term rental market in recent years to short-term tourism-related market letting. The 2019 legislation introduced under the planning code was an innovative measure intended to reverse this trend and influence the return of much-needed accommodation being used for short-term letting purposes in the designated rent pressure zones to the long-term private rental market, thereby increasing supply in that market and helping to stabilise rents. However, there have been some issues with the practical implementation and enforcement of the legislation, which has inhibited the achievement of its underlying objectives. The proposals contained in Deputy Ó Broin's Bill relate to the placing of restrictions on the advertising of short-term letting properties in rent pressure zones without the necessary planning permission or exemption, and the application of on-the-spot fines where the existing short-term letting provisions are not being complied with, have some merit and are constructive. We welcome constructive solutions from the Opposition. It is on this basis the Government has decided not to oppose this Private Members' Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> However, as was outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, earlier, and signalled in Housing for All, it is now proposed to transfer the regulation of the short-term letting sector from the planning code to its more natural home, the tourism sector, with a new registration system to be established by Fáilte Ireland and operational from early 2023. It is intended that these new arrangements will be more effective, streamlined and easier to enforce than the current arrangements, delivering on the objective of increasing housing supply in the private rental market. To this end, necessary provisions to underpin the new registration system are being progressed and the Government looks forward to the publication of the new legislative proposals in the coming months with a view to their subsequent urgent enactment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">There were 14 rental properties on one rental website in Dublin 24 this morning. Three of them were basically sheds or granny flats in the bottom of someone's garden. However, many full properties sit on short-term letting sites, taken out of the rental market during a housing crisis and little more than profiteering.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The housing market is a machine with many moving parts. That is the way I see it. The problem at present is that not many of those parts are moving anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Every time Sinn Féin or others in opposition bring forward a motion or a Bill to help alleviate some of the damage Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have caused, we are told that it will not fix the housing crisis. We heard this tonight, some of it from members of the Opposition who consistently vote with Government. We accept this Bill alone will not solve the housing crisis. The vacant property tax that Sinn Féin has been calling for for years will not solve the housing crisis by itself. Just like the affordable housing motion Sinn Féin put forward to the Dáil two weeks ago, it all forms part of a solution. Rather than dismiss the Opposition out of hand, the Government might try to take on board some of what it says because right now its own attempts are simply not working. There is a general consensus, not only in these Houses but outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> For some bizarre reason, the Government appears to many to be totally paralysed in face of the housing crisis. Maybe it simply is not particularly interested in solving it. I do not know what the problem is but there is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I listened during the week to a Fianna Fáil Senator complaining without any shred of irony about having to sleep in his car. That is the reality facing many of my constituents every day. Only it is so awful, it would be comical.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> We need to ban short-term lets in rent pressure zones. We need a ban on rent increases on all existing and new tenancies. We need a Government to put money back in renters' pockets through a refundable tax credit worth a month's rent. The Government must also accept we need to see affordable cost rental delivered at scale. We need to be proactive. We need decisive action. We need to fix what is broken. The housing crisis is a multifaceted problem and we need a multifaceted approach for addressing what is clearly a housing programme that is not working and not delivering for ordinary people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_600">First of all, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan's comments on supporting the Bill and his acknowledgement of the constructive solutions Sinn Féin, in particular, Deputy Ó Broin, has been bringing forward. It is a pity other members of the Government have not recognised the solutions Sinn Féin is offering. As my colleague said, on their own they will not solve the housing crisis, but together, as part of a jigsaw, they come up with a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> To give the Minister of State a feel for where I am coming from, in Cork city, Airbnb showed there were 1,432 entire apartments and homes for short-term let today. On Daft, there were only 76 properties between Cork city and Cork county - the biggest county in Ireland. This goes to the heart of Deputy Ó Broin's Bill to ban short-term lets. The legislation exists. What Deputy Ó Broin has tried to do is improve the legislation by taking the burden off the local authorities and putting it where it belongs, with these companies which are profiteering.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> We have a housing crisis at present with 10,000 people homeless, and the Government is talking about the market solving the problem. It is talking about the Department's housing plan. Meaning no disrespect to the Minister of State, the housing plan is in tatters.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">For the second week in a row at my clinic on Monday, five families came to me about notices to quit. I have heard from more than 30 families who must be out of their homes by October. I am asking the Minister of State because I have no solutions for them. There are no houses to rent in Cork, and even if people could rent them, they could not afford them. What is the Government going to do for those families? I have a woman who must be out of a house on 6 June. Her husband works full-time and she works part-time. They have two children, one of whom has a disability. Where will she go on 7 June, because they will be homeless? That is happening under this Government's watch.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">Renters need a break. We have had five years now of month-on-month falling supply. It is not just landlords leaving the market as they are taking rental properties with them as they sell them. Rents have never been higher and they are now higher than they were at the very peak of the Celtic tiger and continuing to rise. We have had nine straight months of a rising rate of homelessness of adults and children. Half of the notices to quit are landlords selling and leaving the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> It gives me no pleasure to say it but there is a reason for this and it is 11 years of failed Fine Gael housing policy in the private rental sector. It was supported for five years by Fianna Fáil and, unfortunately, notwithstanding its good policies in opposition, the Green Party is now supporting those same policies. That is the reason we are in our current difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I have said from the very start of this debate that short-term lets are not the cause of the crisis in the private rental sector, but at a time when every long-term rental unit has the potential to prevent a family with children becoming homeless, the full enforcement of regulations formulated by a former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, is valuable at this point. We have never said it would solve the housing crisis or that the approach is a silver bullet, but at the very minimum, the regulations that exist should be enforced. I assure my colleagues from County Kerry about what they should know, which is that those regulations do not apply to areas not designated as rent pressure zones, including many of the rural areas about which they spoke. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae also posed a very important question. What is done for the workers in Dingle? If we have no rental units they can rent, who is going to staff the pubs where the tourists he wants in short-term rentals might go? He cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> It is always a shame when a Minister of State who starts a row leaves the Chamber before the row can be finished, but I should at least put on the record my responses to Deputy Peter Burke. He claims Sinn Féin's proposal for a refundable tax credit to put a month's rent back in renters' pockets will drive up rents. He conveniently forgets to mention, of course, that we would combine that with a three-year ban on rent increases for all new and existing tenancies, which would make rent increases impossible. He claims our proposals for a second home tax would make the lives of single property landlords worse, but he is wrong because we would abolish the property tax, so they would be no worse off than they are under this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> Again, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is correct that the Government has not introduced tenancies of indefinite duration and it is not honest to say that. The Government made a small technical change, welcome as it was, but until we remove the section 34 grounds for notices to quit, tenancies of indefinite duration do not exist in this jurisdiction. At the very least we should be upfront with people. It is incorrect for the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to say there is not a privileging of institutional investors. The very fact they pay no tax on their rent roll and single property landlords pay a high rate of tax is evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> There seems to be a difference between what the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has said and what the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, states. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, very clearly said local authorities and the planning code would no longer have a role in this area. There is value in giving planning authorities a role in determining whether properties in certain areas should be in the long-term or short-term rental market. They have a housing needs and demand assessment and they understand what is needed, so they can make those judgment calls rather than just giving a blanket "yes" or "no" inside or outside rent pressure zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> There is an argument that planning enforcement is slow, legalistic and expensive so we cannot have spot fines, but that misses the point. It is precisely because planning enforcement is so slow, legalistic and expensive that we should consider spot fines, which would be a much more effective approach, especially in cases like this. Notwithstanding all of that we will look at the Government's legislation positively when it comes forward. The one thing I have not heard from the Government is any sanction on platforms, estate agents or anybody else who facilitates and profits from the short-term letting of properties that are breaking planning law. I have concerns about this being done through Fáilte Ireland but I will discuss those at the appropriate time. Whether it is done through Fáilte Ireland or local authorities, it is not acceptable for an estate agent or a platform like Airbnb to advertise and take money from hosts who are outside the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> More than those of anybody else, the remarks of Deputy Connolly probably summed this up in saying how ironic it is that the Opposition is bringing forward a Bill to assist the Government in enforcing its own regulations. In the spirit of co-operation I outlined at the start, I urge the Government to work with us on this and engage in the process. Let us ensure that whatever legislation is brought forward fixes the problem. Where short-term lets are appropriate for tourism reasons, let us have them. Where genuine peer-to-peer home sharing is a good idea, let us have it. Let us not, however, allow thousands of properties that should be in the owner occupation or long-term rental market to operate above the law in the short-term letting market. It is not good or lawful. We should, collectively, stamp it out.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_614">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The programme for Government contains a broad range of policies and proposals that represent a coherent approach to enhancing and sustaining a more safe and just society. To deliver a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland, we must have a system that has all the necessary tools to ensure that, after due process has been served, the sentence handed down matches the crime. As part of my Department's work programme set out in Justice Plan 2022, there is a commitment to examine reforms on mandatory life sentences for murder. This is with a view to making provision for judges to impose a minimum number of years to be served having regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in the particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> To progress this matter, I will be consulting the Attorney General and other Government colleagues in bringing forward this reform, which will give the public greater confidence that in the most heinous murder cases, judges will have the discretion to set a minimum sentence of 20 or 30 years, or even more, recognising the reality that over the past ten years, many people serving life sentences have been imprisoned for at least 20 years and in some cases considerably longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_616"> I have asked my Department to look at cases involving offences other than murder, as we know life sentences could be handed down for serious sexual assault, rape and abuse, especially involving children, or in the case of multiple murders. It should not just apply for murder cases and we must ensure that where there are particularly heinous and difficult cases, this would apply to them as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> The recommendation from the Law Reform Commission's 2013 report will inform this process and I can outline that in a moment. As the Deputy may be aware, a life sentence in Ireland remains applicable even after release from custody, and a breach of parole conditions results in a return to prison. In terms of the timeframe for this work, I hope to be in a position to finalise proposals and bring them to Government in the coming months. I would like to have that done before the summer recess, while acknowledging the huge pressure many of my officials are under with their workload. We would very much like to bring it forward before the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> This initiative relating to mandatory life sentences should be seen in the context of the review of my Department's wider programme of prison and penal reform, details of which I plan to publish in the coming months. I can also go into those in further detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_619">I was looking at this recently and the issue in particular relates to the especially heinous murders we know of, many of which have made headlines over many years. There are serious cases and in the past we have seen people getting life sentences but being released after 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">It is not that terribly long ago since it was after even less time. It certainly did not equate to life and in some cases it was as low as seven years before people went before the parole board. This is an issue that many people have a problem with, particularly victims and families of victims of very serious crimes. The Minister also mentioned serious sexual assaults and cases of incest. These are very difficult issues of abuse where we need to look seriously at how long the sentences are and provide assurance to victims and families of victims that they are being looked after in how we deal with it. I looked at a number of cases, one of which was that of Adam O'Keeffe who was convicted of a vicious murder.</p>

            <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_621">It is important to put on the record that the average length of time a life sentence prisoner will serve is approximately 20 years. The length of time before such prisoners can come before the parole board is now 12 years, which has increased from nine years. The period of 20 years acknowledges that people do serve this length of time. For me what is important is not only making sure the sentences match the crime and that we give judges discretion but also the impact this has on victims or their family members or survivors. To know somebody is even being considered for parole after 12 years when such an horrendous crime is involved can be traumatic and retraumatise victims. Even though it seems like a long time it is not really and we know this. For me this is important. It is done in other jurisdictions. The Law Reform Commission notes the only completely mandatory sentencing in Ireland is life sentence for murder. It also notes that judges have no discretion here, most impose a life sentence and they do not even have the power to suggest a specific minimum sentence, unlike the position in other jurisdictions. For example, in Northern Ireland a judge can recommend a minimum term that must be served. It is about giving this discretion. It is not about telling judges what they should or should not do. It is acknowledging that, on average, people serve 20 years. We should not put undue pressure on victims and victims' families by allowing some people to come before the parole board after the shorter length 12 years or that a judge would make that decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">I appreciate that and we are on the same page in respect of this. We remember the Joe O'Reilly case and vicious murder of his wife Rachel. He received a life sentence and he has already been granted access to the parole board. He applied for temporary release in 2021 having served just over 15 years. There are many cases like this. There are particularly difficult cases, such as that of Graham Dwyer who was convicted of the horrific murder of Elaine O'Hara. He must serve a minimum of 12 years and we can be sure he will not be slow to go before the parole board as is the case with many of these people. We need to have a review. In the review of overall sentencing and how the penal system works I fully agree we have to try to find a process that reforms people who can be reformed and do all of that. We must also look to the victims and families who have gone through the huge torture of losing a loved one or, worse, where people themselves have been the victims of terrible abuse. There has to be proper recourse for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">There is a balance with restorative justice and making sure we are focused on trying to reform people, particularly where heinous crimes have been committed. At the same time I believe the punishment should match the crime. This is why I want to give greater discretion to judges. We have also seen changes in recent times for burglary. The maximum sentence is 14 years but for aggravated burglary someone can serve up to life in prison. There are also mitigating factors and repeat offenders. In 2015 we saw changes to the Act, including that bail could be refused. The Judicial Council has established a sentencing guidelines committee. Its first area of work will be on sexual assault. Various areas are being looked at with regard to sentencing, while not forgetting we have a reform programme and a penal policy we need to develop. This is about community involvement and engaging with people, acknowledging the fact that approximately 70% of people in prison have mental health or drug or alcohol problems. There are two sides to this. In the most heinous of crimes, judges should have discretion to impose a more severe sentence and make sure victims and families of victims are not put through the trauma of having to deal with something after 12 years, which is a relatively short period of time.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">I thank the Deputy for raising the question. As he will be aware, the Department opened applications for the new community safety innovation fund on 11 April. Reflecting the success of An Garda Síochána and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in identifying and seizing proceeds from criminal activity, the new fund will use money seized from the proceeds of crime to support investment in innovative community safety projects. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay of €2 million for this year and will be subject to a robust evaluation at the end of the first year to inform future decisions. The intention is that bids for further allocations will be part of the normal budgetary process.</p>
            <p eId="para_627"> It is anticipated that the type of projects which may be supported will include new additional activities not already covered by existing funding streams. These will be intended to tackle crime or reduce the fear of crime, improve community safety, support the creation of safe and resilient communities, and reduce re-offending or divert vulnerable individuals away from engagement in criminal behaviour. The fund will ensure that the success of An Garda Síochána and CAB is reflected back into new investments in our communities and on projects that will build strong and safe communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_628"> Community safety is about people being safe and, just as importantly, feeling safe within their communities. This, of course, goes beyond policing alone. The fund will ensure the best proposals get the funding they need and will encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local needs best. The development of innovative ideas will also allow best practice on community safety and youth justice to be shared with other partnerships and communities nationally as new proposals are developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_629"> The fund is open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for through other funds managed by Departments and agencies. The call for applications for the fund runs from 11 April until 8 June 2022 and grants will range from €20,000 to €150,000. An information webinar will be held at 4 p.m. on 30 May to provide information for potential applicants to the scheme. If the Deputy is aware of any suitable projects, I would urge him to encourage them to apply for funding. Completed application forms are to be returned by 5 p.m. on 8 June 2022 to a dedicated email address, which is CommunitySafetyInnovationFund@justice.ie. Further information is available on the Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">I welcome this funding from the proceeds of crime and the Criminal Assets Bureau. I can think of many initiatives and projects that could benefit from this funding, particularly in the area I represent which has been greatly affected by organised crime. The profits largely go unseen by CAB but the community will benefit from an element of them through this fund. From my understanding, there is no correlation between the funding and areas affected by crime. The initiative is welcome. Its precursor was the Dormant Accounts Fund from which many projects benefited.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this very important matter. A good chunk of the Dormant Accounts Fund will go into youth justice this year to help alleviate similar issues. The criteria for this fund are fairly broad and I encourage organisations to apply. The main reason that a project would not qualify for funding is if funding could be obtained from another Department or an organisation is already receiving funding for a similar project. Otherwise the scheme is fairly broad. The amount of funding is expected to increase over the years. The first year of the fund will really be about evaluating the projects. What will be important in this evaluation will be to see and assess whether the communities that most need the funding are getting it. This evaluation will happen at the end of the year once the funding goes out. It will be an important part of the evaluation. The Deputy is correct that the funding is not directed at particular areas but it will be a very important element. We will be very conscious when the funding goes out that it goes to areas that most need the support.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">We agree that the best way to tackle the causes of crime is to invest in communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">I would argue that social deprivation and marginalisation draw people into criminality. It can be very complex. Criminality involving drugs is extremely profitable. With the trappings come major amounts of money. There is an echelon who extremely well out of that and who generally do not live in the communities that are affected. Communities then feel the effects of that criminality. I do not have time to tease out the reasons. We must adopt a different approach to how we treat people who are drawn into crime. They are not bad people. They are just drawn in by the alternative economy. That economy can be a massive draw, especially in working-class areas. It draws in so many people who should not be there. In an ideal world, the funding of communities should not come from CAB sources. In a better world, where people are not drawn into crime, Government and State agencies would fund projects on their own initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">The point the Deputy touches on is correct. Nobody is born a criminal or with criminal inclinations. Young people are often groomed and drawn into crime. The key purpose of the Greentown Project, using evidence-based research, is to tackle the grooming of young people into crime. Money is often used to lure them into criminal activity. That is an important part of our youth justice strategy. The cause of young people getting into crime is also trauma informed, with them perhaps coming from very difficult backgrounds. It takes a lot of intensive work to help support those young people and redirect them away from criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> We see this funding as a starting point. It amounts to €2 million and is expected to grow. There will be an evaluation at the end of it to determine how the funding has been used.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I would like to get an indication from the Minister of State on the engagement the Department has had with the National Rural Safety Forum and the work that stems from it. Have there been any initiatives or progress following the meeting of the forum? The last time we raised the issue of rural crime in the House, Tom Niland from County Sligo was in a coma. I am glad to report that he has regained consciousness and is making progress. He is an example of many people living in rural areas who feel very vulnerable. It is important to state that the vast majority of people are safe in our communities but, in many cases, there is an element of vulnerability because they are so isolated. The general public want to see more being done to protect people in our communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter involving the National Rural Safety Forum. As he may be aware, the purpose of the forum is to develop a nationwide network for the distribution of consistent highly-effective crime prevention advice, increase engagement within communities, and prevent and reduce opportunities for crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> The forum is co-chaired by Assistant Garda Commissioner Paula Hilman and Mr. Brian Rushe, deputy president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA. My Department is represented at all forum meetings. Other organisations represented on the forum include Muintir na Tíre, Age Friendly Ireland, Foróige, the GAA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, the Irish Countrywomen’s Association, the County and City Management Association, Active Retirement Ireland, the National Transport Authority, Macra na Feirme, neighbourhood watch, ESB Networks and the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> The Deputy may be aware that on 27 April, the forum, supported by the Department of Justice, hosted a national community engagement day for the first time since 2020. It could not be held in previous years because of the pandemic. The day comprised well-publicised meet-and-greet opportunities at more than 300 venues throughout the State where members of the public could engage directly with representatives of An Garda Síochána, IFA branch representatives and other community groups in their area, including receiving crime prevention advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> People living in rural communities and, indeed, all communities in Ireland, deserve to feel and be safe. My hope is that events such as the national community engagement day can nurture the already strong bonds between An Garda Síochána, community representatives and the people they serve. I was delighted to take part in the day and met with Assistant Commissioner Hilman, IFA president Tim Cullinan and members of the public in Counties Wexford, Kildare and Dublin, during the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> A key pillar of the programme for Government is building stronger and safer communities.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department funds a number of initiatives around the country to help build rural safety. In co-ordination with our colleagues in the National Rural Safety Forum, I intend to develop and publish a rural safety action plan this autumn, which will complement the work of the forum and consolidate the many excellent initiatives that are already under way nationally on rural safety and through the National Rural Safety Forum.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">I welcome this initiative and the work that has been done, as well as the collaboration with so many rural organisations that represent people in rural communities. At the core of this issue, as I said as the outset, is the fear many people who live in isolated areas have. When they go to a Garda station to get a form signed, they cannot find a garda. It gives them little confidence that they will be able to get a garda when they are in real trouble. There are issues in large geographical areas where there are only one or two patrol cars trying to cover the area. Having gardaí on the ground in rural areas is the most reassuring measure for people. They should also be gardaí that people know. I recall growing up many years ago, as I am sure the Minister of State does, if you had a bald tyre or a tail light not working, you were afraid you would meet a garda on the road. There is no fear of that happening anymore. It is very seldom that you see gardaí on rural country roads. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. The way to do that is to have the gardaí knitted into and part of the community, so that they are known. People should be reassured that gardaí are there to protect them.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_644">I agree that it is not just about people being safe. People need to feel safe. In a number of the high-profile cases in rural Ireland, the Garda has had a number of real successes. However, we need to get to a point where such incidents are not happening and where people feel protected and safe in their communities. That means targeting those organised groups, many of which rob a number of houses and, unfortunately, carry out heinous acts against very vulnerable people.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> The law already treats burglary very seriously. The maximum penalty for burglary is 14 years in prison, and a sentence of up to life imprisonment can be imposed for aggravated burglary. In 2015, the law in this area was further strengthened by the introduction of legislation targeting repeat offenders, including the provision of allowing bail to be denied in appropriate cases. The Act also provides for consecutive sentences for the prolific burglars. The Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for presumptive minimum sentences for certain repeat offences. The law is very strong in this area. More gardaí were attested last week and, going forward, there will be further attestations in the coming year. An additional 800 gardaí were provided for in last year's budget. The civilianisation of An Garda Síochána continues at pace, which will free up gardaí for other activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">I am aware of much of that work. I know the aspect of deterrence is important. There are strong sentences in place, but the biggest deterrent of all is having gardaí in a local area where people know them and can see them, and that any stranger coming through the area will see their presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> Many communities have had to organise initiatives themselves. There have been huge successes with text-alert schemes and community alert in many areas. This is a reflection of the failings of the official structures, that they are not working, and, therefore, people have to come together to do it.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> We also need more emphasis on prevention. When criminals drive past a house they are thinking of targeting, if they see that there are cameras, lights on, and an alarm, it certainly deters them. Those kinds of preventative measures need to be put in place. Many people in rural areas cannot afford that. There needs to be consideration of what assistance can be given to help people put those protective measures in place on their properties.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">The rural safety forum is a real opportunity for those organisations to come together. Rural Ireland is strongly represented on the forum. Some really good discussions have taken place, from which many good ideas have come. We fund Muintir na Tíre for the text alert system. I know Muintir na Tíre is working on a number of alternative projects as well. We will continue to look at and review any proposals that come forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> We also have the first pilot local community safety partnerships, three of which have been set up across the country. They are about bringing together the different State agencies to ensure that our communities are kept safe. Keeping our communities safe is not simply about policing and An Garda Síochána. We have to make sure that our communities have those strengths in place, using all the State apparatus to ensure that rural communities are safe and that people feel safe within their homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. Delivering family justice more effectively is a priority for me and is a major element of my Justice Plan 2022. The report of the joint Oireachtas committee, to which the Deputy referred, made 38 recommendations across a range of areas in family justice relating to the family court structure; the specialisation and training of professionals, lawyers and judges; resourcing; transparency; and the voice of the child, which is at the centre of everything that we do. Key among these recommendations was the introduction of legislation for the establishment of a dedicated and integrated family court within existing court structures. As the Deputy mentioned, it was not necessarily recommended that we have a completely different court structure, but hubs within the current structure where there would be dedicated family law sitting days. Some would sit in the same court structures and buildings that we have currently, and some would fit into others. However, they would be completely separate, with sittings on specific days. The programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a family court Bill to create a new dedicated family court or hub within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres. What is really important here is that families deserve time. They are not getting that time at the moment, because our District Courts, in particular, are so busy. There might be time at the end of what has been a very difficult and long day for a judge. Families also need continuity. It may be the case that the family turns up and a different judge is hearing the case who has not heard it before, and does not have time to go through the details of it. We also need to ensure we have specialist training so that judges who are dealing with people know and understand the different challenges that families are facing. In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a family court Bill along the lines of the general scheme, which has been published. Drafting of the Bill is ongoing with a view to publishing it as soon as possible. The intention is that it will be published before the summer recess. We want to get the process moving as quickly as possible. The family court Bill will make provision for the establishment of a family court as divisions within the existing court structures, as I mentioned, providing for a family high court, a circuit family court, and a district family court, each dealing with family law matters as appropriate to its jurisdiction. We want to reduce, as much as possible, the number of cases going to the higher courts. The costs incurred by families are astronomical.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I welcome the fact the family court Bill will be published before the recess. The Minister has captured the essence of what the problem is. The family law system in Ireland, as it currently stands, is archaic. My difficulty - and the message I get from my constituents - is that those attending their local District Court on family law matters are obliged to sit in the court where there are a multitude of people on a variety of charges, including criminal charges. While the family law cases are heard in private, the very presence of the parties in the court is public. That can be very traumatic for reasons that are quite obvious. The least that people deserve, when they are attending court on a family law matter, is that their case will be heard in private, and that they have the privacy required.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">I absolutely agree. Unfortunately, when it gets to a court setting, there are situations where the process has most likely become adversarial, and in many cases - although, not always - other avenues, such as mediation, have been tried. Before Covid, people would sit across from each other in tight spaces, many of whom would be waiting all day for their case to be heard. At the end of the day, the case may be adjourned. Therefore, it is really important we have specific sittings, potentially in a different building or room from other court sittings, or on different days or times from other court sittings. That will be provided for specifically in this Bill. We are also engaging with the Courts Service on the operational aspects of the intended approach to the overall family justice strategy. Separate from this legislation, which is specific to the structure of the courts, there is a family justice oversight group that is chaired by a senior official from my own Department. The group has engaged significantly not just with the legal profession, but with family representative groups. There has been special engagement with children through Tusla. We have identified not just the actual physical infrastructure, but the ancillary supports and the type of supports required, including mediation, psychological supports, or even just ensuring that family members can get a cup of tea or food when they are in the courts. All of it needs to be considered to make it as family-friendly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">I thank the Minister. I acknowledge the fact that both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, are making reforms and are progressive. They have taken a lot of very positive initiatives in the Department to date. I am glad that the Minister has acknowledged that the current system is failing people. The District Courts are overcrowded. It takes an unreasonable amount of time for cases to be heard. Due to this pressure, District Court judges simply do not have the time required to deal with in-depth and sensitive family law cases. We should note that since the amalgamation of smaller local courts into bigger District Courts, the criminal case lists have become unmanageable, despite increased sittings. As we know, family law matters take time. That time is simply not available under the current system. These cases require a separate and dedicated family law court, as the Minister mentioned. In conjunction with this, I ask the Minister to give people greater access to mediation. The service is currently underfunded and unavailable to many people.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">On the Deputy's final point, and it is a significant point, we need to make sure that the system is well resourced. We can introduce legislation, but we also need to ensure that the structures and the judges are in place. I believe that in the Deputy's own county recently, a number of sittings had to be cancelled simply because the judge was sick. We need to ensure that through the separate process that is currently under way to look at judicial numbers, the system is resourced in the way that it needs to be. Separate from that, we must ensure it is not all about courts. As I said at the outset, by the time cases get to court, the process is adversarial for many people, and gets even worse. Cases cost people a lot of money, can be delayed and can take a lot of time. The family justice oversight group and its recommendations will place a particular focus on mediation and putting the child at the centre of the process. Obviously, bringing a child to court is very difficult. That, in itself, has implications. It is about trying to do everything that we can to prevent cases from getting to the stage where they are heard in court, while acknowledging that we cannot prevent all cases from getting to that stage. The legislation will be important. We must ensure that the legislation is resourced and the courts are identified across the country so that people have equal access, depending on where they are and where they live, so that they do not have to travel too far. We must also ensure that we have enough judges who are trained and who can deliver in this specific area. I thank the Deputy for his question.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I assure him that along with the Government, I am particularly committed to ensuring there is strong, visible policing throughout the country. The budget provided by Government to the Garda this year is the largest to date, with an allocation of more than €2 billion for 2022.  I have just come from an event in the Gresham Hotel to commemorate the establishment of the Civic Guard, which then became An Garda Síochána. The event focused on policing over the 100 years of the organisation. Core to policing from the start, in 1922, to now has been the really strong connection that An Garda Síochána has with our communities. In part, that is because it is an unarmed force. That, in itself, breaks down a lot of barriers. Protecting people and putting them at the centre of the work of An Garda Síochána has created that engagement. I was at the Garda College in Templemore last week, where 102 new members were attested. Prior to that 156 passed out. Approximately 50 to 60 will pass out in the next few weeks, and as of September, 200 will pass out every 11 weeks. In making sure that gardaí are visible, it is important we ensure there are more gardaí on the beat. We have increased the numbers in the last year or two. We will get to a stage, come September, where every 11 weeks 200 gardaí will be represented and sent right across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> Obviously, there are many ways in which they then can do their work. First, it is about ensuring they are spread out across the various different communities. That is a role for the Garda Commissioner. It is also about ensuring we have as many gardaí on front-line duties. In the last number of years, 800 Garda members have been reassigned to front-line duties because there are other gardaí who are coming in and doing work behind the desk and in the office. There is a budget of €147 million. A significant part of that is going into ICT, which allows gardaí to do their job more effectively out on the beat and to engage with people in a different way. Some €12 million has been invested in our Garda fleet, which means more gardaí out in our rural towns and villages.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">There has also been investment in bikes in towns and larger villages, so that gardaí can be seen on their bikes as well as patrolling on their feet. This is what people want to see.</p>

            <p eId="para_663">In order to get extra people on the ground, we need to tackle the issue where, if a garda is on a shift and if there is an arrest, for example, for antisocial behaviour, a car accident or whatever it is he or she has to do, approximately three hours of that garda's day then turns into paperwork. Those three hours are spent behind doors where he or she is not visible. To counteract that we need more gardaí on the ground. I understand that more people are being trained up and deployed but we need to ensure that they are covered in the towns, villages and rural areas around the county and not per head of population, as within the larger cities. This is because when gardaí are in a local area in a county, they have to travel up to 40 square miles to cover areas themselves and there may be only four or five gardaí on duty, if one is sick or engaged in paperwork.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> We need extra gardaí and to double their number in our stations around County Limerick to ensure that we have a police presence at all times, where people are sick or are otherwise engaged with paperwork behind a desk, after having completed their investigations during the day.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">The premise of the Deputy's question is how we can have more Garda visibility within our communities. This is number one about ensuring that we have more gardaí and, obviously, the more we have, the more we have in our communities, towns and villages, be it behind the desk, on front-line duties, working in the specialist units that are being developed, economic crime, online fraud, the new types of crimes that are being committed, domestic violence and, obviously, community engagement as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> There are other ways through which members of the Garda can be even more visible when one thinks about the fact that our Garda stations and teams are also online. I attended my own joint policing committee, JPC, yesterday where our sergeant talked about the Garda's own Facebook presence, how the force is engaging with people on Instagram, how it is communicating what is going on in an area, and how people can contact them. There is a visibility online as well as a physical one in communities with people.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> There has been the development of the community safety partnerships which is an important way in which all members of the community can engage with An Garda Síochána because it is not just our local councillors and representatives in a JPC, but it involves Tusla, our education providers, the HSE, local community groups and organisations, and minority groups. This is a way for people to engage with An Garda Síochána within the communities which, perhaps, has also not existed to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">I thank the Minister. I appreciate everything done by An Garda Síochána. I see how dangerous the job is, in that 4,000 members of An Garda Síochána were assaulted in the past five years and some 243 members were injured after having been assaulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> For us in Limerick to have a good Garda service but we need a headquarters. I informed the Minister last week that Newcastle West is without its headquarters. We were given a promise when the old station closed down in Newcastle West, with a population of 8,000 people in that area alone, but we have no headquarters now. These are now in two houses in Askeaton, where a Garda station has been operated from there. They do fantastic work there and, yes, the members are upskilling through the Internet and so forth, but they need a headquarters. We need a place where our gardaí can have a proper headquarters in order that the appropriate infrastructure is put in place. </p>
            <p eId="para_670"> I do not have a problem with what the gardaí are doing but have a problem with the infrastructure that is there to support An Garda Síochána. I would greatly appreciate anything that the Minister can do to help us get our Garda station back in Newcastle West.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">I agree with the Deputy that we need to protect the gardaí and to ensure that when they go about their business and actively put themselves in harm's way to protect us, they need to be supported. We can do that in many ways. We can ensure that they have the stations and the areas to work in appropriately, that they have the technology and equipment that they need, that they have the cars and the appropriate training, which the unions have raised with me on quite a few occasions, and in respect of the capital budget which I will be finalising, hopefully, in the coming weeks with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan. This will be a new capital plan which will set out for the next number of years what that expenditure looks like, not just in the physical infrastructure but the ICT also.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> There are a number of ways in which we can support members of the Garda to do their job. Supporting the Garda and encouraging more people to apply is reflected in the fact that more than 11,000 people applied in the most recent competition. This was completely fantastic and it will allow us to have that rolling in of 200 people coming out of Templemore every 11 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> What is also great is that about 40% of the applicants are women. The role is becoming more attractive to women even though it is a challenging one. </p>
            <p eId="para_674"> One also has a much more diverse application profile so that people need to see themselves in the gardaí who support and keep their communities safe. The fact that we have much more diversity and many more different backgrounds of people who were not born in Ireland who are now applying, is very welcome. That visibility, in itself, encourages people, particularly younger people, to engage with the Garda when they see themselves in the gardaí who serve them.</p>

            <p eId="para_676">My question to the Minister is about the scoping report into the death of Shane O'Farrell that was insisted upon by the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan, over two years ago. It is almost 11 years since Shane O'Farrell was killed in his home town of Monaghan. There has been a litany of failures by the State in delivering justice for the O'Farrell family. This delay is compounding that injustice and I ask the Minister to give the House a clear timeframe on the delivery of that scoping report, which is way too long overdue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_677">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As the Deputy will be aware, the retired judge, Judge Gerard Haughton, has been conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death. The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and, if so, to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> I am informed that the judge is on the verge of completing the scoping exercise and has begun the process to compile his final report. This is progress or is a change from the last time we spoke on this issue when information was still to be gathered. I am told now that this information has all been gathered and he has now begun the process to complete his final report, which will then be presented to me. I am told this will be very shortly but I do not have an exact timeframe. It has certainly moved on to the final stages where the report has been compiled. Once that process is complete, I understand the judge will submit it to me. Once I have received the final report, the advice of the Attorney General will be sought on publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> I will conclude by restating in the clearest possible terms that neither the Government nor my own Department is in any way opposed to the possibility of a further inquiry or an independent inquiry into the case if that is what is recommended. However, the Deputy will understand, I cannot and do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the work that has been done and I appreciate that it is going on much longer than people would like. I know that this has been greatly challenging for Shane O'Farrell's family. I would like to see it completed as quickly as possible and not to be answering questions in here where I am not able to give a direct timeframe. I am assured that this scoping exercise is at the very final stages and that I will hopefully have it before the summer term.</p>

            <p eId="para_680">I acknowledge that the Minister's answer is progress from the previous answers we have received. Being on the verge of completion is not an answer as to a timeframe. It then has to go to the Attorney General for his view and that will be sought before there is any publication of the scoping report.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> I remind people generally in the public that this scoping exercise was sought as part of the journey for reaching the truth for the O'Farrell family. That journey, however, has actually become an odyssey and it has become an enormous task to get this over the line. It cannot be overstated how painful that has been for the family and how anxious they are to see the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> Regardless of whether the Attorney General recommends a further inquiry, this will not go away because of the determination of the family and of those of us who support them. There will be the continued demand for a full public inquiry, which is based on the fact that we know there has been a litany of failures by the State and it is only due to the family itself lodging freedom of information questions that many of those failures of the State and of the justice system have been exposed. This, more or less, twisted the arm of the State to have this scoping exercise, which, I repeat, has been delayed inordinately.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">I thank the Deputy for her contribution. The very fact that this is an independent inquiry and that the retired judge, Judge Haughton, is independent in the work that he is doing means that I am not able to give the Deputy the timeframe because I do not have it. I know, however, that the report is at its final stages. I am aware that this may not be much comfort at the moment without having a set timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> What I have seen since coming into the Department is that the other section 42 inquiries are taking longer than anyone would like or had ever thought they would take. That perhaps is something we need to look at into the future if we are looking at further types of inquiries, or independent inquiries, that are led under the section 42 process. This process has obviously started and we need to allow it to continue to completion. I fully respect the independent work of the judge and I have no doubt that when it is finalised and that when the work is done, I will receive it as quickly as possible. I would also like that the advice from the Attorney General come back to me as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">I will ask that of him when he is presented with the report. I will seek his advice in terms of its publication but also the recommendations in it and where we go from here. I hope we will be able to respond at that stage to the Deputy and, most importantly, to the O'Farrell family.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">I have to accept the Minister's bona fides in this matter, as I have said. However, it is almost 11 years since the terrible killing of this young man. It should never have happened, as we all know. Had justice been applied as it should have been, the killer would have been in custody instead of being loose on the roads and able to carry out a hit-and-run killing. Many questions need to be answered by the State and the justice system. I hope the scoping exercise has attempted to answer many of those questions. However, if the Attorney General sits on the report for a long period, how will we in this House manage to push forward a result on behalf of Shane's family and, indeed, on behalf of all the families who are watching these kinds of inquiries because they, too, have felt a great injustice was done in cases that appertain to them? There has been a compounding of insult to the O'Farrell family by the delay in issuing this report. Some indication of how quickly the Attorney General will allow for its publication - or not, as he may decide - is needed. That decision needs to be given within a tight timeline. My view, of course, is that he absolutely must allow it to be published.</p>

            <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_687">I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me in, although I would have preferred if my question, which is almost identical to that of Deputy Bríd Smith, was grouped with it, as that would have allowed for more interaction. The Minister said her Department is not opposed to a public inquiry or other types of inquiries. I do not buy that. The reason there has been a scoping exercise is the Department and the Minister at the time, rather than adhering to the wishes of both Houses of the Oireachtas and establishing a public inquiry, put in place the scoping exercise, which has taken three years to complete. That is in addition to the six years the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, inquiry took to complete. Of the ten and a half years that Shane O'Farrell has been dead, it has been impossible for nine of them to ask a question of a Minister for Justice because, we were told, another investigation was ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> Shane's family has demanded a public inquiry, as have the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister said the section 42 provisions may not be adequate but she also seems to be saying that she has done no examination as to what a public inquiry might look like in this case. Are we looking at a further delay following the publication of the scoping exercise, which I would argue should be released into the record of the Dáil to give it privilege, regardless of what the Attorney General should say? Is the Minister suggesting there may be a further lengthy delay before we get the public inquiry that is so rightly deserved in this case?</p>

            <p eId="para_689">I want to place on the record again that, as Minister, I have absolutely no objection to a full public inquiry, nor does my Department. The Taoiseach has put on the record that he has no objection on behalf of the Government to such an inquiry. I have not seen the work done to date and I do not know what is in the report. I have not begun any scoping exercise because I have not seen the report and I do not want to pre-empt what is in it. It may recommend a public inquiry or it may not. I do not know. It is important that we allow Judge Haughton to continue the work he has started and to make sure that process is complete. If we need to do something more after that, we will do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> There are a lot of issues to be looked at, as Deputy Bríd Smith said. I have no doubt that all the concerns that have been raised, including in respect of the terms of reference and everything that has been set out, will be addressed by the judge. In regard to the Attorney General, all I can say is that, in my experience, he is not a man to wait about or delay on things. He is very efficient in his work. Certainly, if this report is presented to him, I know he will come back to me on it as quickly as he can.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">I will not spend too much time on this question but it raises an important issue, which relates to the resources An Garda Síochána has to tackle violence against women. I know this is an issue that is close to the Minister's heart. It is sometimes referred to as domestic violence but, in fact, it is a broader issue that can occur outside the home as well. What resources are being put in place to deal with this scourge?</p>

            <p eId="para_697">This is an area I have prioritised and in respect of which I have been doing a huge amount of work, in conjunction with a large number of agencies, front-line workers and colleagues across the House, to try to improve the services and supports and put victims at the very centre of everything we do. An Garda Síochána plays a vital role in all of that. Gardaí are hugely important in making sure people are supported when they come forward and as they go through the criminal justice process.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> We have taken a number of steps to support the Garda in this area. They include strengthening the criminal law, including work currently under way to create stand-alone offences of stalking and non-fatal strangulation. We are progressing a new sexual offences Bill, which I have worked on with colleagues in the justice committee, including the Deputy as Chairman. We will look to enact the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 later this year to address the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community. We have had preliminary trial hearings conducted under Coco's law and legislation on hate crimes is coming down the line. It is important that An Garda Síochána has strong laws to work with.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> Separate to that, we have a budget of €2 billion, as I mentioned earlier, which is an increase of approximately €300 million since 2019. Part of that provision will focus specifically on addressing domestic violence - both violence against women and abuse in general. We have €10.5 million for operational expenditure on mobile devices, equipment for specialist units and ongoing training for priority areas. There will be an increase of more than 70 in the number of divisional protective services units, DPSUs, which are the specified units for dealing with these types of crimes, bringing the total number of gardaí deployed in them to 332 across the various divisions. The roll-out of the Garda Síochána (digital recording) Bill, which I hope to have enacted later this year, will be particularly helpful to first responders. Gardaí often say that the first few seconds of interacting with a perpetrator and victim after they arrive on the scene are extremely important. Getting footage of those interactions will be hugely helpful. The Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, has completed a nationwide canvass in regard to the training needs of the DPSUs and a new training programme will be ready for delivery in the coming weeks, with in-person training expected to recommence in quarter 3 of this year. This is something for which gardaí in the DPSUs have been particularly calling.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">I acknowledge and appreciate all the work being done in this area. I recognise in particular the work done by the Minister, along with my colleague, Senator Chambers, and others, in regard to the provisions on stalking and other advances that have been made in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> I raise this issue as a male who has many significant female others, not least my daughters and wife. One of my daughters was at an event last night and, unfortunately, a shudder went through me from the involuntary fear one has that something might happen. It is hard to get away from that. It is important that we have all the preventative measures, precautions and mitigations in place. Domestic violence is often spoken about. I welcome the increase in the number of DPSUs and the other measures that have been taken. However, it needs to go beyond that, into the streets, the public domain and the wider sphere. It is important that we invest in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> We are all very aware of what happened to Ashling Murphy and the awful vista that was thrust upon us at the start of this year. Unfortunately, such deaths have happened too often. A societal shift, rather than any particular departmental shift, is required. We must do all we can collectively to address the issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I agree that it is about improving the criminal justice system, providing resources for the Garda and making sure we have stronger laws, but there also are educational and information aspects. For the Deputy's daughter or anybody else going out, it is about knowing who one can turn to and the resources and supports that are available. Knowing the Garda is there to support people is hugely important. A major part of the domestic violence strategy that will be published in the coming weeks will be a focus on education, national awareness-raising campaigns and making sure information is available to citizens but also to the Garda. We see pockets of really fantastic work happening where gardaí are working with local community groups, refuge accommodation providers locally and the various domestic violence support groups, linking in with the legal profession and schools, to highlight the challenges and dangers that are out there for younger people, particularly when they are socialising at night. It is really important that we play our role in this House in resourcing and strengthening the laws, but there also is a wider societal aspect. We had a fantastic discussion about this recently, in which we recognised that we all, men and women, need to play our part.</p>

            <p eId="para_704">I will not dwell on this much further other than to say the Minister is correct about the role of community gardaí, which has been expanded in recent years. There is a sensitivity and awareness of the issues, particularly in domestic situations. I am thinking in particular of the Garda personnel in Naas, including Superintendent Oliver Henry, Garda Gary Cogan, Garda Shane Smith and others, who have responded so well and have really been to the fore in community policing and engaging with, and getting to know, people in those situations and the dynamics that apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">I am sure that is replicated in every district in the country. That is part of the solution, along with all the things the Minister has mentioned. A societal, educational and attitudinal shift is required here. It has taken us a couple of millennia but better late than never.</p>

            <p eId="para_706">We all know the local gardaí in our community. We have probably, over the past couple of years, gotten to know some of the members of the DPSUs and those who deal with very difficult and quite severe cases on a day-to-day basis. However, that is not necessarily the first place that a person will go. It is making sure that people know the garda in the local station is there to support them and that the garda has a certain level of training. While there is specific, in-person training for the people of the DPSUs, there is also training for front-line gardaí to make sure that whether it is a victim of sexual or physical assault, or coercive control, which is an area that has finally been recognised in our domestic violence laws, they are able to respond and provide the appropriate support, resources and information in the particular situation. Key to that are the relationships they have within the community. I know Deputy Murnane O'Connor is very focused on the development of new refuges and accommodation to make sure there is a place for people to go when they go to the Garda station and cannot go home. Gardaí do considerable work in this area and it is important that we continue to support them.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I acknowledge a very productive session with the Minister today at the Joint Committee on Justice on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022, which will reform and transform the way we appoint judges going forward. However, there remains a significant gap between the numbers we have on the Bench and those of our European neighbours and international comparators. It is imperative that Government does everything it can to address that.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">Our priority is to ensure that the courts are resourced to administer justice efficiently and effectively for citizens in their access to justice.  The Government endeavours to fill judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity and a number of such vacancies have been filled in recent times. In order to bring more strategic focus to this, the Minister established a judicial planning working group in April 2021, in line with commitments in the programme for Government and the justice plan action to, "Establish a working group to consider the number of and type of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years". Any further judicial resourcing needs will ultimately be informed by the report and recommendations of this group.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> To help inform the work of this group, the OECD was commissioned to prepare an independent review of judicial resources, including benchmarks against international comparators. Due to the complexity of evaluating the data and analysis underpinning the research, it has taken longer than originally anticipated for the OECD to complete its work. Its final report is expected shortly and the Minister has just received an interim progress report from the chair of the working group. The latest indications are that the group expects to produce its final report this autumn having considered the OECD research.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> As the Deputy will be aware, in the interim, the Government has already provided additional resources to the High Court, where the number of judges was increased by five last year, from 37 to 42, with the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021. In addition, section 8 of the Act provided for the number of High Court judges to be exceeded by a further one, should the Government, at the request of the Minister, having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, form the opinion that it was necessary due to the volume of business and to ensure the efficient administration of justice. The Minister brought a memorandum to Government on 19 January 2022, with a recommendation to have that additional High Court post filled. With that appointment to the High Court, the complement of High Court judges is now six more than it was on 1 October 2021.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">I acknowledge the good work the Minister of State is doing on the gambling regulation Bill, the report on which we published recently in the committee, along with the Minister and others. Judicial numbers is a concern that I may not have expected at the outset of this Dáil term. When we began hearings at the Joint Committee on Justice, almost without exception, the witnesses on a variety of topics and areas expressed a concern that the number of judges on the Bench was inadequate. This affects a number of areas in the judicial system, in terms of the administration of justice, trials waiting to be heard, victims of domestic violence waiting to get their day out and many others who cannot have their issues resolved because of the lack of judges.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> I know that the numbers are quite low. Unfortunately, we rank towards the bottom of the European league table in terms of the number in the Judiciary per head of population. I appreciate that the Minister was out of action at the time, but I was concerned by a comment made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in recent months about the effective cost of a High Court judge, that being the salary cost. It is approximately €100,000 to €150,000. That is a very populist and narrow way to approach the issue. We should not be looking at the salary of individuals but at how many divorces, criminal trials, legislative amendments and civil or commercial matters over which they will preside.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">The cost of one salary per year pales into insignificance when compared with the cost of court sitting day after day for a full year. It is an unfortunate comparison and I hope it is not reflective of Government's attitude.</p>

            <p eId="para_716">The judicial planning working group is looking at the very things about which the Deputy is concerned. We will be using those data from the OECD to assess the need in terms of judges, at present and going forward, in order that we can have an evidence-based, informed understanding of the need we have for additional judges in this country. The working group's report will inform that and the Government's decision-making. I should point out that the recent appointments and expansion in the number of High Court judges represents one of the largest increases in judges in recent memory and a very significant investment by the State in judicial resources. Once that working group reports, it will give us a better foundation for assessing exactly what is needed in the State in terms of increasing the number of judges.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_717">I welcome that response and the acknowledgement from Government of the position. The statistics tell us that Ireland has 3.3 judges per 100,000 people, compared with an average of 21 judges per 100,000 people throughout the OECD and the EU. I know the Minister of State has acknowledged that in his response which I welcome. It strikes me that in terms of the moves in the recent years, such as the abolition of town councils by a previous Government and the moves away from subsidiarity and local representation, the moves away from judges <i>per capita</i> mean that decision-making and administration of justice, local government and even our administration of the powers over the people are being taken away, at every stage, from the people further back. We should not allow that to happen. It would be remiss of me not to mention Naas district, where one single judge presides over what is probably the busiest district in the country. Cork has four judges. Limerick has three judges and Dublin has multiple judges. However, Naas, which the numbers reflect as being one of the busiest districts in the commuter belt, if not the country, has a single judge presiding. I ask the Government to consider whether that needs to be tackled, perhaps with an additional judge for the Naas district.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I will support Deputy Lawless on that. In the past couple of weeks, I have spoken to many people in the legal profession. The consistent problem they kept bringing up, both in civil and criminal cases, was the long delays because of the absence of judges. One of the issues that was raised with me was how courts moving away from the small provincial towns to larger courts in different areas had an impact. Making sure we have an enough judges to administer law effectively and efficiently is one of the problems. It is not efficient at present and that needs to be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">The working group will inform and give us an evidence base. In the past, when we were assessing increasing the number of judges, it was done in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. The purpose of what we are doing now is to make sure that we have an evidence-based assessment as to how many judges we need and trying to forward plan into the future to have those judges, as we need them, when we need them. There will also be an interim report from this working group, which will be very much considered by the Government when it is provided.</p>

            <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_722">The recommendations contained in the Garda Síochána Inspectorate report, Countering the Threat of Internal Corruption – A review of counter-corruption structures, strategies and processes in the Garda Síochána, are extremely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">They are positive recommendations which have the potential to greatly strengthen how the threat of corruption is dealt with in An Garda Síochána and to develop a shared understanding of the threat of corruption across the broader criminal justice sector. The Deputy will be aware that this is the first self-initiated inspection conducted by the inspectorate following consultations with a number of key stakeholders, including An Garda Síochána, the Policing Authority and my Department. I clarify for the Deputy that the purpose of the inspection was not to identify or investigate specific incidents of corruption within An Garda Síochána.  Instead, in keeping with the inspectorate’s mission, the purpose was to examine and make recommendations to strengthen the organisation's effectiveness in preventing, detecting and mitigating the threat of internal corruption. The inspection also assessed the structures, strategies and processes in An Garda Síochána, benchmarking them against a range of commonly accepted counter-corruption functions which help to support a modern police service to operate effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> The final report, published in March 2021, included 34 recommendations, of which 30 were directed at An Garda Síochána, three at my Department and one at the Department of Transport. I acknowledge it has taken longer for an implementation plan to be brought forward and I would have liked for it to be complete at this stage. There has been extensive engagement between my Department and An Garda Síochána on the development of a specific implementation plan which will address all 34 recommendations. We are at an advanced stage in that process. We have broad agreement on actions to implement each recommendation and it is expected that the plan will be brought to Government and published shortly. It will certainly be done before the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> The publication of the implementation plan will build on a number of recent initiatives which have made progress in this area. While there are 34 recommendations, much work has been done already and the gardaí have move to implement some recommendations. The Garda Commissioner signed the integrity at work pledge with Transparency International and nominated Transparency International Ireland as the specialist body to provide independent advice to Garda personnel on protected disclosures. I will mention others in a supplementary reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">Many key findings of the report point to there being no strategic analysis of the risk of corruption or the dangers of corruption that may exist in many aspects of An Garda Síochána's work. Like many parts of our public service, the gardaí's work is based on trust. We have to trust that the person in the organisation will deliver and is doing the best for everyone concerned. Deputies Bríd Smith and Carthy asked a question about Shane O'Farrell, which reminded me of this. In the end, this comes to the core of many of the scandals, inquiries and investigations that we have had over the years. When there is a mistake or a problem, the instinct has always been to cover it up. That in itself is corruption and the biggest corruption we have had in An Garda Síochána over the years. There is a tendency to immediately cover up. When that cover-up is investigated or questioned, the cover-up is covered up and we end up with layers of problems. That has caused significant issues and needs to be looked at with regard to corruption in An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_727">The role of the inspectorate is to benchmark overall policing performance of the gardaí. It is not just the work they do in the community and how they engage with people, but it is also about looking at the structure to see where there is need for improvement and to make sure the core operations and how they carry out their work are improved. As I mentioned earlier, I just came from an event where the Garda Commissioner said that, over the last 100 years, gardaí have not always got it right. They have made mistakes and even apologised for mistakes made. It is about what the gardaí do when they are made aware of those mistakes. There are 34 recommendations, with 30 being for the gardaí, and before we have even made an implementation plan, they have moved to make those changes and acknowledged that the changes are needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> The Garda Commissioner established the anti-corruption unit in 2020. The unit has a national remit to prevent, detect and investigate corruption and criminality committed, or suspected of being committed, by gardaí or Garda staff. A deputy commissioner was appointed who is responsible for strategy, governance and performance as senior police leader with responsibility for counter-corruption in An Garda Síochána. Several anti-corruption policies were developed and published. The Deputy might be aware that I brought forward the Garda Síochána (Functions and Operational Areas) Act 2022. This contains provisions to support the introduction of regulations in relation to substance misuse testing. Many things have been done to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I appreciate there has been work and advancement. One area which requires focus is gardaí carrying out work outside of their work as a garda. Sometimes that has compromised them and others around them. The work that they often engage in after retiring from An Garda Síochána also needs to be looked at. There is a network that has developed over the years that certainly needs to be brought to an end, because it is not a reflection of the kind of professionalism that we should see in a police service that is there to serve the public. Anything that can be done about that is welcome. I know the Garda Commissioner is aware of it and is trying to come up with solutions. Deputies in every county in the country will give examples of it. It is not a party political issue, but happens across the board. Everyone knows about the cosy arrangements that have been in place in the past have not been healthy or good. They need to be brought to an end.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">It is important to be clear that if people sign up to become members of An Garda Síochána, they have signed up to the rules and regulations and have to adhere to them. The Garda Commissioner has been clear about making sure all members of An Garda Síochána understand and adhere to them. If people retire, they are entitled, within the law, to continue working or engaging in an area that they have spent their entire lives working in, in the same way as the Deputy or I would be if we retired. When people retire, the vast majority do not go home, go on holidays and spend their time in their gardens. Many people use the expertise and knowledge they have built up over many years to support communities and to continue to support people in different ways. The report identifies some failures and where the gardaí need to make improvements. The gardaí have accepted that. It is taking longer than we would like to publish it but it will be published before the summer term. The fact the gardaí have already started to implement it and made progress shows that this is not being forced on them. It is something they welcome. As we look to the next 100 years, we want to make sure they are stronger than ever.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">The Garda Síochána Inspectorate was established in 2006 and is supported by the Department to ensure that adequate financial resources are provided each year through the Estimates process.  The inspectorate is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and the three inspectors are supported by a small team seconded from my Department.  The budget allocation in 2022 is €1.362 million and there are nine staff members currently seconded. The mechanisms by which my Department monitors and appraises the performance of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate are set out in the oversight agreement 2022-2023, which was signed in February 2022. This document is publicly available on my Department’s website.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> My Department’s criminal justice governance function has primary responsibility for the oversight of all criminal justice agencies, including the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. This team uses a number of mechanisms to carry out these duties. As set out in the oversight agreement, at least two formal meetings with the inspectorate are held every year.  Through these meetings, my officials gain a detailed insight into both the inspectorate’s performance on its agreed upon targets for the year and its adherence to the principles of good governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> In between formal governance meetings, the inspectorate provides my Department with an in-depth update on its performance. Outside of these formal meetings and reports, there are regular, less formal engagements between my Department and the inspectorate as the need arises, including regular engagement at a senior level with the chief inspector. Together, these measures ensure that my Department is consistently well-informed about the inspectorate’s performance in relation to its targets. The Deputy also inquired about An Garda Síochána's strategy statement 2022-2024. Under section 21 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Commissioner prepares the strategy, which must have regard for Government policy, the policing priorities as determined by the Policing Authority, the policing principles, and the resources available. The Policing Authority approves the Strategy, with the consent of the Minister. The Garda Commissioner has obtained approval from the Policing Authority for the new strategy for 2022 to 2024 as well as the policing plan for 2022. In addition, the Policing Authority has determined new policing priorities following public consultation, research, and reflection on the previous three years. As Minister, I have consented to the strategy, which will be shortly laid before the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_738">I will outline how it was developed and that might give an indication of where changes were more focused this year. An Garda Síochána took account of a broad spectrum of views in the formulation of the strategy statement. Focus groups were held with nine ethnic and culturally diverse groups from within our communities, including the Laois African Support Group, the LGBTQ+ Sligo IT, the Father Peter McVerry Trust and the Ballinamore direct provision centre. We have formal correspondence seeking the views and input from Departments as well as local authorities, non-governmental agencies and community representatives as well as individual members of the public. An Garda Síochána also sought input from the public in assisting in the development of the strategy, which closed in May of last year. The overall objectives are translated into operational measures through the day-to-day activities of policing, that is, everything from detecting crime to dealing directly with victims, looking at specific types of criminal activity including domestic violence through our DPSUs or types of fraud. It is quite a broad spectrum. I can get the Deputy a copy of the strategy for this year, which will give him more detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">Absolutely, the intention of the strategy and the fact that it is not a ten-year strategy but for a much shorter timeframe is so that it can respond to the needs and requirements of communities and the population more generally. I do not have the details in front of me but if the Deputy reads some of the previous strategies, there will be certain priorities that roll over and that are included on a continuous basis. As issues arise and in more recent years there has been a particular focus on online fraud, what is referred to as romance fraud and different types of crime that are now being committed through the advancement of technology. That is not something that would have been part of an overall strategy of An Garda Síochána a number of years ago. Every year they build on the work that is done, where there is further work that is needed or where there is a clear priority that would always need to be there. Where there are new issues that arise, through the engagement with the groups such as those I mentioned in this particular term, they will identify where there are particular concerns within communities, be they new and emerging concerns or existing ones. Those specific issues are put into the policing strategy. I do not have the current strategy in front of me but I will be able to get a copy for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government and for me. It is reflected in the programme for Government, the Government’s Action Plan for Insurance Reform, and in my own justice plan for 2022. This is a whole-of-government effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_744"> My Department has responsibility or part responsibility for 34 of the 66 actions contained in the action plan, or approximately half. We have 26 that are now complete, including the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines, the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 and, significantly, the establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office, which was opened by An Garda Síochána last July. I appreciate that I would have liked to have brought forward the amendments to the Occupier's Liability Act prior to 17 May, when the heads of the Bill were published, but that is not to say that a huge amount of work has not been done within my own Department. I acknowledge the work done by officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> Last week, I received Government approval to reform duty of care legislation. I propose to amend a number of sections of the Occupiers’ Liability Act, in line with the Government policy objective. I believe these proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that businesses, community groups and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities, but making sure there was personal responsibility put back on individuals, customers and members of the public as well. The amendments contain four key developments: first, inserting into primary law a number of recent court decisions that rebalance the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors and recreational users; second, changing the standard to clarify that when the occupier of a property has acted with reckless disregard for a visitor or customer, it is the standard of reckless disregard rather than reasonable grounds that should apply in any consideration of liability; third, limiting the circumstances in which a court can impose liability on the occupier of a premises where a person has entered onto a premises for the purpose of committing an offence, which is unfortunately something we have seen in recent years; and, fourth, allowing for a broader range of scenarios where it can be shown that a visitor or customer has voluntarily assumed a risk resulting in harm. What is important here is that this applies to parents as well when they are bringing children into a playground or areas where there is a potential risk. </p>
            <p eId="para_746"> In terms of the timeframe, we brought forward the amendments and set out the heads of the Bill last week. The intention is that it would be part of the upcoming Court and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which I hope to publish this side of the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">I thank the Minister. Small businesses, community groups in her own constituency and, right across the State, voluntary organisations are priced out of the market because of the crisis that is in insurance reform. Unfortunately, reform is happening at a snail's pace. This key legislative change is being supported across the House. We have been calling for this for years. The campaigners have been calling for it for years. Finally when the Government agrees to do it, it misses its own deadline by a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> We now have proposals before us. The first is to amend the Occupiers' Liability Act to take account of recent case law that rebalances responsibility between the occupier and the visitor, including taking into account the probability of an accident occurring, not just its occurrence, and the probable severity of an injury resulting from that occurrence. Another is to amend the Act by replace reference to reasonable grounds or reasonable action with whether an occupier acted with reckless disregard to the person or property. Can the Minister clarify the class of persons to whom this will apply in respect of reckless disregard? Are we talking about visitors, customers or trespassers? What classes of persons will all of this apply to?</p>

            <p eId="para_749">On the second point in respect of the second change in the standard, to clarify that where an occupier of the property has acted with reckless disregard for a visitor or customer, we are referring to the publican, shop owner or local council if it is a playground it owns. In a recent example given to me, a farmer is asked if a hunt can go across his or her land. The test previous to now had been of reasonable grounds, which left it very open for the occupier who perhaps had not done anything wrong or been reckless but an accident simply had happened and the onus was put back on him or her. The standard must be higher now so there must be a reckless disregard. If a hunt is going through a field and a farmer has given them permission but has left old machinery and spikes sticking up out of the ground, or there is a child using a playground where there is a piece of equipment that is not properly tied on or there is an accident, there is a reckless disregard there. This is to make sure that there is a threshold where one must show that somebody has been reckless and really disregarded a person's safety where they have given permission to be on the premises or on the land, site, building or other area.</p>

            <p eId="para_750">A further proposal is to insert provisions regarding voluntary assumption of risks into the Occupiers' Liability Act. Its aim is to prevent plaintiffs from bringing claims where they have knowingly or willingly put themselves into a position that could lead to harm and injury to themselves. Under the Civil Liability Act 1961, for an occupier to be relieved of liability for this reason there must be a written agreement in place to evidence a voluntary assumption of risk. The purpose of this proposal I understand is to remove that requirement for a written agreement so that it is enough for an occupier to demonstrate by reference to words or conduct that the visitor voluntarily assumed risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Does the Minister accept that the success of this proposal, like many of the others she is making to rebalance the duty of care, will ultimately depend on how the courts interpret these provisions? Could she give us some guidance on her understanding of that? Could she give a definitive timeline for this legislation and its implementation, for which we have been waiting years?</p>

            <p eId="para_752">On the last point, only this weekend the son of somebody I know fell off the very top of a slide and fractured his arm. It is not possible to sue somebody because it is an accident that happened at home. Given how the law is written, even if there is a sign up in a playground, a "Floor wet" sign in a shop or a sign that states "Enter at your own risk", it does not seem to matter in the courts. It does not seem to be something that can be used to show a warning was given. What we are talking about here is rebalancing to account for what is reasonable where something is broken or not put in place properly where there is a sign stating "You enter the playground at your own risk". However, where somebody has an accident in the same way that one could happen at home, there has to be an assumption that he or she has taken a risk at a certain level. If a person, through due diligence, puts up a sign to make the information clear, the law, as currently written, does not take it into account. I acknowledge that people have been waiting for what we has been proposed. We are working closely with the insurance alliance group and others to make sure we get this right because it applies not only to businesses but also to community groups. I hope to introduce the measure as part of miscellaneous provisions Bill before the summer. Depending on the Oireachtas, we hope to have it implemented as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland on this issue was accepted in principle at the time of publication, subject to further evaluation of the implications, including resource implications, how best it might be achieved and the timing of implementation. A high-level review group, HLRG, on the role of An Garda Síochána in the public prosecution system was established in September 2020 to conduct this evaluation and recommend a preferred option for consideration by the Government. The group is to report to the Government via the Department of the Taoiseach to take account of the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> I am grateful to the chair of the group, a former Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Dermot McCarthy. His group comprises representatives of stakeholders, including relevant Departments, the Judiciary, An Garda Síochána, the DPP, the State Solicitors Association, the NGO sector, academics and legal practitioners. The group's work will be grounded in empirical analysis, applying the experience and expertise of its members, to prepare recommendations for the Government. In considering the implications of changes to this system recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, the group will have particular regard to international best practice and the experience of relevant jurisdictions that made changes to their prosecution systems over recent years; the experience of operating different prosecution procedures in the Dublin metropolitan region by comparison with the rest of the country; and the cost of current practices and policies to serve as a benchmark in evaluating options for change. </p>
            <p eId="para_757"> The group submitted an interim report to me on its work in accordance with its terms of reference in the first quarter of 2021. While not strictly required under their terms of reference, a second interim report in respect of the group's activity during 2021 was submitted late last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> The group is very conscious of the need to ensure that Ireland's prosecution system fits within the international standards and norms expected of a developed democracy and to take advantage of the lessons learned in other jurisdictions in their experience of reforming their prosecution services.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> With the international research and a time-and-effort survey within An Garda now completed, I understand the group has developed a broader insight into the nuances of the public prosecution system and is well placed to finalise its work. The recommendations are to be the subject of the group's final report to the Government. It is expected that the group and chair will be in a position to complete the report during the second quarter of this year; again, before the summer. Therefore, we have a lot coming before the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">It is going to be a busy couple of weeks. I am aware of the work done on this. It needs to be considered very carefully because it is quite unusual that the investigating authority or service is also the prosecuting service. That is the case regarding many aspects of what An Garda Síochána does. Other jurisdictions have a different system that has served them better. The recommendation that needs to be examined comes from recognising that the current process has its shortcomings. I look forward to the full report. I believe there was a report on this in the mid- to late 1990s and there was a recommendation that no changes be made. Circumstances have changed and advanced since then and I believe we seriously need to reconsider the role of the Garda in carrying out prosecutions, particularly serious criminal prosecutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">I acknowledge the independence of the Office of the DPP and the great work carried out by it in conjunction with An Garda. It is important, however, to ensure that we update our legislation, the office and how it operates. The group is engaging with academics and relevant experts and examining other jurisdictions, as the Deputy has mentioned. It has considered the experience of common law jurisdictions and those which operate under the general jurisprudence of European victims' rights law or its equivalent; jurisdictions where changes have taken place in the conduct of prosecutions, especially with regard to the role of the police, which is what we are talking about here; and the role of law enforcement and non-policing agencies in prosecutorial regimes, including decisions to prosecute and the conduct of prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> The review and scope of the work being done by the group led by the former Secretary General to the Government are quite broad. The group is not considering the Irish system alone; it is taking best practice into account. It is considering the systems of other jurisdictions where there have been changes and where there are other prosecutorial mechanisms. I look forward to seeing the report and will not pre-empt it.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> We have had two interim reports but we will move to try to implement the recommendations as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">Will the report cover the oversight of investigations? In most other jurisdictions, there is some form of judicial oversight, particularly regarding serious crime, to ensure that everything is done correctly and properly. There is a barrister or other individual in charge of the investigation to ensure everything is done as it should be. That majority of Garda investigations, even the most serious kinds, are carried out properly, but sometimes we have difficulties. Additional oversight in respect of that needs to be considered. Is that part of this process?</p>

            <p eId="para_765">The DPP is independent of my office and has the power to issue directions in all cases to An Garda, and An Garda must comply. Where the Garda does not comply and where concerns are raised, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, has a role. Individuals with specific concerns can go to it and gardaí can raise concerns themselves. The review covers several areas, and I do not want to pre-empt what will come of it. Obviously, we will share it with the Deputy and others when completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I will give a very short reply. The policing, security and community safety Bill contains proposals for the improvement of GSOC. These are to expand the remit of the body to include Garda staff and allegations that come to light other than by way of a complaint from a member of the public and provide that all complaints, other than minor service-level-type complaints, will be investigated by the body itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The Bill will streamline investigation procedures to support timely, transparent and effective resolution of complaints and investigations. At the moment there is a twin-track process where you have to decide if it is civil or criminal at the outset and then go back if that is not the case. We are trying to streamline that in order that it is one simple process. There will be restructuring of the body itself, replacing the current three-person commission with an ombudsman and deputy ombudsman model, so that the organisation will have a clear and publicly identifiable leader for the first time. We will provide for office holders to be appointed by the President on the nomination of Government following a selection process by the Public Appointments Service. We will continue to invest. We have seen a significant increase in funding to GSOC in recent years and that will continue. It is not just to carry out its functions, but to expand on its team and staff. In relation to being able to go back on cases, I am informed that will be possible but there will be a threshold. We will set out in detail in the legislation what that threshold will be, whether, for example, the emergence of new evidence or something else coming to light that is substantially different to the case that had been brought about. It will be a matter for GSOC to decide whether it can be reopened, but the possibility will be there. </p>

            <p eId="para_774">There was an understanding in the previous Dáil that the Minister would come in and, if the Minister was not available, the Deputy would have the option of deferring the matter until the Minister was available to come into the House. No such option was afforded to me. We are back to the bad old days. Bad habits die hard in this House. The Acting Chairman has been here much longer than I am and he knows as well as I do that one brings and progresses something but the minute one's back is turned, it regresses to the old system.</p>
            <p eId="para_775"> I raised this issue immediately after the announcement that bus and rail fares were to be reduced by 20% on the mainland. When I raised it with the Minister, I was given a number of reasons why it could not happen. I pursued the matter in our parliamentary party with the Taoiseach and spoke to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who had no problem funding any change. After that, I was told the matter was referred to the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_776"> What was the big problem on the islands? I was told it was that there are private companies providing services to the islands and that that was not the case with bus and train services. That is not true. For example, Expressway does not benefit from the 20%, nor do the many other private companies providing regular bus services. On the other hand, as I told the Minister the first day, there is a unique arrangement on the islands because there are contracted services put out to public tender. In putting them out to public tender, there is a unique islander rate. If an islander goes on the contracted service, he or she does not pay the commercial fare but a rate predetermined by the Department. I introduced that process. I remember setting the adult return fee at €8, no matter what boat service was taken or how far out into the sea it went. That was the maximum. It was €5 for students and youth and nothing for those under five years of age. That was raised to €10. This is unique. If you go on the private operator that operates commercially, there is no obligation on that operator to provide that service. That is the rate we want reduced. We do not want to touch the commercial rates, which are a matter for the operator. As I remember, the operator stated the commercial rate and set the rate, whereas the islander rate was set by the Department. I had hoped that in the intervening weeks, the Department would have looked at the issue instead of giving the push-off. </p>
            <p eId="para_777"> The other thing those in the Department seem to think extraordinary is that this is for buses and trains and I am looking to apply it to an air service to the Aran Islands and a boat service. I was on Inis Mór today at a funeral and there is not much point in offering a train service from that island to the mainland. We do not have underwater rail. Nor is a bus service practical. I do not think the mode of transport makes much difference. I ask for this issue to be dealt with and for the islander-only unique fares to be reduced by 20% forthwith. The year is going on, the scheme has been in place for nearly two months and we have no movement on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The sustainability of communities on our offshore islands is a core objective of the Government as set out in the rural development policy for 2021 to 2025, Our Rural Future. The policy acknowledges the importance to island communities of access to reliable, safe and affordable connectivity services to and from the mainland. Contracts for these services are procured by the Department of Rural and Community Development on the open market through the procurement process. This ensures all providers are treated equally and the selection process is fair and transparent for all.</p>
            <p eId="para_779"> The Department of Transport recently introduced a fare reduction scheme that sees an average 20% reduction on PSO public transport services managed by the National Transport Authority. The scheme covers public transport services operated by Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead Ireland and TFI Local Link. It is important to note that other subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Transport, such as the PSO air service to Donegal and Kerry, are not covered by the scheme. Similarly, the subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development to the offshore islands do not qualify for the scheme. Unlike the services managed by the NTA, offshore islands have a mix of subsidised and non-subsidised transport services. While the Department is open to examining ways of ensuring island transport services are affordable, it is concerned that the introduction of a fare reduction scheme for subsidised services could bring the existing contracts and procurement processes into disrepute. All of the contracted air, ferry and cargo services managed by the Department are procured in an open and fair procedure. Providing a fare reduction scheme for chosen suppliers could have the potential to undermine those procedures and may lead to reduced services to the islands, particularly with regard to non-subsidised services and other private operators who may be placed at a disadvantage. The Minister has sought advice from the Attorney General on the matter and officials continue to engage thereon. </p>

            <p eId="para_780">The Minister of State is a very fair and, more important, highly intelligent man. I am sure he was embarrassed reading that out. The red herring of the PSO Donegal and Kerry services can be put aside because there are buses going to Donegal and buses and trains going to Kerry, right to the airport in the case of Kerry. It does not quite work that way when you are trying to get to an island.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> The Minister of State stated that the subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development to the offshore islands do not qualify for the scheme. We know that. That is why I am standing here. However, the Minister of State did not give the reason, other than that the Minister will not do it. The Minister of State then said if the €10 standard fare for islanders to €8, it would bring the scheme into disrepute. When I was Minister, I did exactly that. It used to be much higher and variable. I set the rate and, rather than being in disrepute on the island, I think I was held in high esteem. The Minister of State then made the point that if the small number of islanders, relative to the number of tourists and other people who go to the island, got this small reduction, it would undermine the commercial non-contracted services. The Minister of State must have cringed reading that out because if you have a guaranteed €10 fare and the normal tourist fare is €20, why would you take the transport for €20 when it is available in the contracted service at the predetermined rate?</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Furthermore, I ask the Minister of State to name all the islands that have private services running in parallel with the services contracted by the Department. I have a fair knowledge of the islands. There may be one or two with such private services but they are few and far between. If he does not have the answers tonight, I ask him to go back to the Department and the Minister and request that they address this issue in a written reply.</p>

On the PSO routes managed by the NTA, the Department of Rural and Community Development does not subsidise all services and all routes, as has been stated, and careful consideration, therefore, must be given to any change that could substantially alter the contracts or put private operators at a disadvantage. I have certainly heard what the Deputy has to say and I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for being here to respond on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_786"> Last Friday, I attended a seminar in Cobh organised by Cobh and Harbour Chamber. There were some serious people there representing the energy sector. The focus was on renewables and the great potential that exists in Cork Harbour in particular for renewables such as offshore wind and so forth. Several of those present expressed concern, however, in respect of the State energy security framework into the future, and next winter in particular. Ireland's natural gas supply is dependent on imports from a single source in the UK, namely, Moffat, in Scotland, while the Corrib gas field, which is depleting, supplies approximately one quarter of the State's annual needs. We now have a serious situation in Europe, with a challenge to gas supplies. The national energy security framework, published in April 2022, states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_787">[I]t should be noted that the UK’s indigenous production is decreasing, resulting in increased imports of liquified natural gas. In 2020, Russia supplied over 40% of the EU’s natural gas. Reduced supplies of gas from Russia could have knock on effects for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">If there are pressures on the UK, there could be a domino effect. We are at the end of the pipeline. What are the contingency plans for next winter if the gas supply reduces? If that happens, electricity generation, heating and power supply generally will be hit. What are the contingencies in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> I have tabled parliamentary questions in respect of floating storage regasification units. Other countries are using them. They are importing liquefied natural gas, LNG. The response to the parliamentary questions I tabled seems to mix up fracked gas with LNG. Is analysis being carried out at the moment in respect of floating storage regasification units? It is one answer here. There may be another answer that I am missing. If that pipeline from Moffat is under pressure, however, we will be in serious trouble and people will suffer. It is bad enough having very high prices; it will be something different altogether if we do not have gas at all. This is very serious.</p>
            <p eId="para_790"> I know that a review is ongoing and will be delivered in quarter 3 of 2022. That could be the end of September or October. By that stage, the winter will be on us and it will be too late to do anything. What are the contingency plans in the case of this happening? The Government's own framework states, "we need to be adequately prepared to deal with supply issues, should they materialise". What preparation has been made? The national energy security framework is very good but it heads out to 2030 and 2050. I want to find out about what we are going to do next winter and next September. Let us not forget that there were several occasions last winter when the generation capacity was under pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> I know the Minister spoke about making available further generation capacity in Dublin with more gas burning units. If there is no gas to burn in those units, however, what good are they? This is very serious. It is probably one of the most serious issues facing the State. The Government or the Minister of State may have a response on this issue this evening. It may be that contingency plans are being worked on. I would like to know what they are and I think the people would too.</p>

          <speech by="#OssianSmyth" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Climate_and_Communications" eId="spk_254">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_792">I thank the Deputy for asking this important question. Ireland imports approximately three quarters of its natural gas from the UK, with the remainder coming from the Corrib field. The UK has a diverse supply of gas, including indigenous UK gas, Norwegian gas, liquefied natural gas and via interconnectors with Belgium and the Netherlands. The UK and, by extension, Ireland are not heavily reliant on Russian gas, although the actions by Russia have placed upward pressure on gas and, consequently, electricity prices. Ireland has no gas storage or LNG.</p>
            <p eId="para_793"> The national energy security framework, published in April 2022, sets out the response of the Government to the Ukraine crisis in the context of natural gas, oil and electricity. The framework provides a single overarching initial response to address Ireland's energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine. The development of this framework has taken account of the need to decarbonise our society and economy as set out in recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, as well as Ireland's targets to reduce emissions by 51% over the decade to 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 as set out in the climate action plan. The framework sets out the Government's action in response to these issues across key themes as follows: managing the impact on consumers and businesses; ensuring security of energy supply in the near term; and reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_794"> The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has established a new energy security emergency group, chaired by the Secretary General, which is co-ordinating and overseeing national-level activity and responses in the context of the impact of the war on energy security. The group includes representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the National Oil Reserves Agency, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Gas Networks Ireland, EirGrid and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The work of the group includes: overseeing the implementation of the national energy security framework which has set out the national responses to the impacts on the energy sector; co-ordinating a response to support consumers and businesses, with a focus on financially vulnerable households and those in or at risk of energy poverty; and ensuring emergency plans are up to date and stress tested.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> At EU level, measures are in place to address the implications of the war in Ukraine, including any disruption of gas from Russia. These include updated risk analysis and contingency planning, and putting in place a new EU law to ensure that gas storage facilities in the EU are filled in advance of the coming winter. The European Commission is engaging with other countries to ensure sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from disruptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_796"> The war in Ukraine has impacted Europe's energy system and triggered a decision by the European Union to phase out its dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible. This will also impact where and how we source that energy and change how we design energy policy to ensure the long-term resilience of the system. The European Commission's RePowerEU communication issued last Wednesday, 18 May, sets out the measures it proposes to end dependence on Russian energy by saving energy, diversifying supplies away from Russia, substituting fossil fuels by accelerating Europe's clean energy transition, removing financial and regulatory barriers to rolling out infrastructure, and ensuring member states have contingency plans to deal with any disruption in supplies from Russia. In addition, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland's electricity and natural gas systems. It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months and then submitted to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_797"> Coming back to the issue of the upcoming winter, Ireland is one of the countries in Europe that is least reliant on Russian gas. There is no immediate threat to our gas supplies. Notwithstanding this, in the event of any gas supply emergency, there is excellent co-operation between Irish and UK gas system operators in respect of gas supplies from the UK. This co-operation includes regular testing of emergency plans by the operators. Ireland's gas-fired power plants are capable of running on liquid fuels in the event of a gas supply disruption and have storage of fuels available.</p>
            <p eId="para_798"> I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter and look forward to hearing his views.</p>

          <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_255">
            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_799">We could probably have a longer debate on this issue. Is there a signed agreement between the UK and Ireland in respect of Ireland's interconnectors and the flow of gas to which the Minister of State referred? It is all very fine stating there is excellent co-operation but what is the nature of that co-operation? Is it a signed agreement between the two countries? As all present are aware, the UK is no longer in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> The Minister of State noted in his response that we have no storage for LNG. There is no gas storage in the State, so if anything happens to those pipelines, we are in trouble. What is the situation in respect of liquid fuels being used to power gas-fired power plants in the event of a gas supply disruption? To what liquid fuels is he referring? Is it gasoline, diesel, kerosene or something else? How much storage is there?</p>
            <p eId="para_801">For how long could we depend on that? I noted the Minister of State referred to the REpowerEU. It speaks about diversifying gas supplies via higher liquified natural gas and pipeline imports from non-Russian supplies and larger volumes of biomethane and renewable hydrogen production and imports. We are nowhere on that at the moment. We are dependent on the pipeline from Scotland and that is it. What happens if there is pressure in the UK? I have read that it is a secure supply, the one secure supply in Europe, but it is the only one we have. We know the adage about having all your eggs in one basket. Having all your gas in one pipeline might not be the wisest thing either if anything happens there. I know a review is going on, which will possibly be brought forward to the end of September when the work will start. However, we are into winter then. If anything happens with this gas from the UK, we are in trouble. We must remember that there is a lot of pressure in Europe and further afield. The Minister of State mentioned Norway and Denmark. If the squeeze happens at that end and it transfers into Britain and then here, we are in trouble and we have no contingency plan. The Minister of State has not outlined anything that gives me any solace that there is a contingency plan. If there is storage of LNG in Europe, how does it get here? How do we get it here if the pipeline from Britain is out of action or reduced in some way?</p>

            <p eId="para_802">The first question is the nature of the legal agreement between Ireland and the UK on the supply of gas. I will have to consult the Civil Service to give Deputy Stanton an exact answer on that. I do not, however, think it is a gentlemen’s agreement between the two countries. The next question was about the form of liquid back-up for the gas supply plans. I believe it is gas oil and liquid distillate, so it is between those two fuel sources. In regard to how much is available, the National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, is the statutory body that provides for back-up of liquid fuels in Europe. I believe every country is required to maintain 90 days' supply. That is a mixture of different fuels, everything from crude oil to petrol and every distillate in between. I presume that some of that is allocated but I can get a better answer for Deputy Stanton.</p>
            <p eId="para_803"> The energy security review is coming up this autumn. The Deputy referenced the national energy security framework, which was published last month. Work has been done on that. The REpowerEU is the emergency response of the EU to this energy crisis. That has been proposed by the European Commission last week and I believe it will be agreed at the European Council shortly. That approaches the problem in three areas. It states we need to do more for energy efficiency; we need to source our fuels from different countries, so we need to attempt to deals with countries other than Russia; and we need to speed up the deployment of renewables in two ways, by providing new sources of finance, including common finance across the EU in green bonds, but also by speeding up the planning process and there are specific rules about managing to be able to deploy renewables much faster than they are deployed at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">Over the weekend I received the devastating news from the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, that 11 of the 23 CAMHS beds in Linn Dara have closed. I thank the association for informing me because it seems no effort was made by the Minister of State’s office to do so. When was she going to inform the public? Was she hoping that the closure of children’s mental health beds would simply go unnoticed? When did she find out there was a problem? What exactly has she done since finding out?</p>
            <p eId="para_805"> This is not the first time beds have been closed in Linn Dara. A similar incident happened in 2017. It seems the Government has learned nothing. Linn Dara inpatient units provide services for children and adolescents with severe or complex mental illnesses requiring a combination of intense interventions and supervision that cannot be provided by community and outpatient services. The closure of these beds will have a devastating impact on our community and on children. How will the Minister of State address the recruitment and the problem around retention of psychiatric nurses?</p>

            <p eId="para_806">I heard the Minister of State speak about this in the media and earlier in the House. Frankly, she sounds more like an observer than somebody who has responsibility for it. We are facing a huge crisis in child and adolescent mental health. It is in the news every day. People are constantly ringing radio programmes, such as Joe Duffy's radio programme, about the crisis being faced.</p>
            <p eId="para_807"> Linn Dara serves people from outside the direct community. As has been said, this is like Groundhog Day. Exactly this time five years ago, there were exactly the same number of beds and exactly the same period of closure. It is not acceptable. It is as if the Government is shutting its eyes to the crisis we have generally in our health service but in particular in maintaining and retaining staff. We bleed staff but we ask ourselves why we bleed them. When is the Minister of State going to sit down with those at the coalface, the nurses themselves and their representatives in the Psychiatric Nurses Association, to get some resolutions to this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_808">As the Minister of State is aware, I raised this question on Leaders' Questions this morning. I made the point that Linn Dara is a key facility for child and adolescents mental health services, CAMHS, nationally and for the greater Dublin area, Wicklow, Kildare and, in particular, Louth. The HSE stated that these bed closures, a reduction of 11 beds down from 24 to 13, is a consequence of a shortage of qualified staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> In acknowledging Sharing the Vision, the Minister of State said that she was hopeful that this implementation plan would advance improvement across CAMHS, mental health team governance, organisation and clinical oversight as well as ensure best practice and patient safety and that in this context, it was critical standardisation and consistency in mental health service delivery were achieved. Does she think she has met that?</p>

            <p eId="para_810">It is important to remember that Linn Dara deals with the most distressed and the most complex cases of children and young people seeking help. The Deputies speaking tonight are from Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-West but the reality is that Linn Dara serves Kildare, Westmeath, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Louth. As Deputy Collins said, this is a national service and we should really have Deputies from each of those constituencies trying to raise this, although I am not sure how we would divide the four minutes.</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> The reality is this essential service is closing to very little noise apart from what we are saying in here. That is disturbing because our mental health services are under great threat. Our CAMHS services are quite simply not up to scratch and are not fit for purpose.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_812">I thank the four Deputies for raising this issue today. Deputy Collins raised it earlier as well. It was raised on Leaders' Questions because it is a very serious situation. I was informed on 11 May 2022 that due to recruitment challenges, the number of operational beds in the Linn Dara CAMHS unit was going to be reduced from 24 to 13 on a temporary basis. Deputy Costello is quite right that the most distressed cases are dealt with in Linn Dara. It is the most fantastic facility with a school attached to it with five teachers. It really is state-of-the-art. I cannot say why this happened five years ago as well but I can tell the Deputies what the situation is now.</p>
            <p eId="para_813"> No patient has been or will be discharged early from the unit. While the reduction in capacity will have an impact on waiting lists, the demand for inpatient beds in CAMHS units over the summer months is usually around half the normal level of capacity. I have the figures for the past four years and it runs at between 55% and 60% capacity but that still does not make it right. This regrettable situation has arisen because a number of nursing posts became vacant simultaneously at Linn Dara for various reasons. The situation is that there are 51 funded posts in Linn Dara and currently 24 of them are in place. To have a safe staffing perspective for those young people using the service, some of the beds had to be closed. As I said, it is not due to lack of financial resources but solely because the nursing complement available through the use of permanent and agency staff is no longer sufficient to continue to provide a full 24-bed inpatient service to a safe standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> In reply to Deputy Ward's question, I have spoken to the HSE. I am not an observer. Far from it, I have never been an observer in this role.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">I spoke to the HSE, the Department and the clinical consultant psychiatrist - the professor who runs the service. I spoke to him at length again yesterday. The situation is they have explored all possible options, which included redeploying staff from other child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, units or teams to Linn Dara, but if they are taken from the community, that impacts the community teams. They had agency staff in place and that worked for quite a time.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> I asked the professor why he felt that they were finding it hard to retain staff, and not so much to recruit them, and there were several issues. The young people and children who are in this service are very complex cases and they need a lot of care. He said that many of the nurses who were working there were very young. Some of them have chosen to travel. Following Covid, the world has opened up again so that people can travel. Second, some of the nurses there had promotional opportunities within the HSE and they were promoted. Third, as the Deputies will be aware, it is quite difficult for people to find accommodation in Dublin. Those were some of the reasons cited by staff that they find it difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> At the same time, we must get over those issues. What I want to do is to make sure that this service is up and running fully as soon as possible. New staff will be recruited. A new group of graduate staff will be available in July and August. They will be recruited immediately. Hopefully, they will take up the posts. We are hopeful that we would have all the beds back open again at the start of September.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> All four CAMHS units nationally - Éist Linn in Cork, Merlin Park in Galway and St. Vincent's, also in Dublin, with ten beds operational at present - hold a team meeting every week and they look at the list. They look at the amount of children who are triaged who are waiting and that already happened this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">I will give the Minister of State some figures. More than 8,000 children are waiting on appointments of primary care psychology, 3,000 of whom are waiting for more than a year. In excess of 4,000 children are waiting for CAMHS appointment, of whom more than 400 are waiting more than a year. If these children get the service they need at an early age, they are less likely to need the more acute services that are provided by such services as Linn Dara when they get older. Does the Minister of State agree that early intervention is key? How will the Government address these failings in the children's mental health service?</p>
            <p eId="para_820"> These are children; they are not statistics. Behind each one of these children, there are hopes, dreams and ambitions and they are being stalled at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_821">The Minister of State says she was informed on 11 May that there was a problem with staffing. She was probably informed on 11 May but the Department and the HSE had known that there was a problem with staffing. As I said earlier, it is like Groundhog Day. We can go right back to 2017 to a replica with the same number of beds and the same period of time. The question is: what will the health services do to retain nurses? To get an answer to that, the Minister of State must sit down with the PNA and other nursing unions. She will not know how it is on the ground and the answers to this unless she talks to those at the coalface and I ask her to do that.</p>

Cutting these beds in Linn Dara must have an impact on children accessing those needs that they can access there. I am asking the Minister of State, as others have asked, to sit down and discuss recruitment and retention with the PNA. It has to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">On top of the waiting list figures that have been mentioned, a significant cohort of young people seek referral to CAMHS who, through inconsistent application of standing operating procedures, do not get their referral accepted, and who are told that it is either only behavioural or only emotional and it is not appropriate. Behind these figures of waiting lists there is another significant cohort who are not even getting the help they need.</p>
            <p eId="para_824"> I am also concerned at throwing fresh graduates into a pressured complex environment, which seems to be a recipe for burnout and increasing the retention problem. I would like to know what is being done on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> I echo the call of the other Deputies to meet with the PNA, particularly around that last issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_826">I do not disagree with anything the Deputies have said. Everybody has the best interests of every child who is on a waiting list and every child who needs to get into one of the approved centres at heart. Everybody feels the same. I am a mother and I feel the exact same. There is not a family in Ireland that, whether directly or indirectly, has not been affected by mental ill-health.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> Regarding the figures, last year the referrals into CAMHS increased by 5,177 to 22,600, which was unprecedented. In the same period, the new referrals seen also increased by just under 2,000. On the waiting list for CAMHS, the figure up to March is 3,443. We managed to take 500 off the list from the previous month.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> Regarding primary care psychology, Deputy Ward stood opposite me previously and quoted figures of 10,000. They are now down to 8,000. I was able to get 1,600 children off the list by a targeted approach before Christmas, and secured another €5.5 million this year to keep that going. I am meeting with the primary care psychology team next week to see where we are at. My focus is on those waiting more than 12 months because, as the Deputy rightly said, early intervention is key. Nobody can disagree with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> Overall, 91% of children who present to CAMHS and who are complex and really in need of support - they may be suicidal, it may be self-harm or whatever - are seen with 48 hours but the problem we have is that there are long waiters who are pushed down the list. There is a targeted approach ongoing at present to reduce waiting lists for CAMHS and the target is focused specifically on those waiting more than 12 months. Currently, 9% of children are waiting longer than 12 months. I hope the next time I stand before the Deputies that figure will be much less than 9%. I will keep them informed. I will be working on this on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> Deputy Bríd Smith stated that I said at the start I was informed on 11 May. I was made aware unofficially in the few weeks preceding that that there were challenges relating to staff.</p>

            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_831">Built in 1893, the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on Upper Baggot Street, more commonly known as Baggot Street hospital, was a main centre of care for a large part of the south-inner city for almost 100 years before the acute services were transferred to St. James's Hospital in 1986.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> Despite its current state of disrepair, this building stretching 5,600 sq. m is still stunning to look at. It is an excellent example of Victorian architecture in the city. Its striking red-brick facade and high spires make it the most striking landmark in that particular area. The architecture is Flemish, as is that of several of the surrounding buildings, and the old nurses' residents is now the Dylan Hotel around the corner on Eastmoreland Place.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> For a time, a number of community services were operated out of the hospital, including a primary care team, a stroke team, addiction services and a gay men's health service, but this has all ceased and the building is now rapidly falling into dereliction in one of the most prime sites in Dublin's south-inner city. Incredibly, Baggot Street hospital has been allowed to remain idle for years and local businesses and residents are now calling for it to be used to house people fleeing the war in eastern Europe. This building could have been repurposed ten to 15 years ago to house Dublin's homeless and maybe that is something that will happen in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> A local developer has said that her building company is happy to provide the labour for this project free of charge. It is estimated to cost €1 million and the labour would be free. That would be a significant saving to the State. That would repair and make fit for purpose the building for Ukrainian refugees. It is estimated the building could comfortably house 200 beds. The developer believes the ground and first floors could be delivered within two months of each other with each subsequent floor taking a month after that to deliver. Works would be done under the supervision of a fire consultant.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> In recent years, the HSE has indicated it plans to sell part of the hospital for it to be converted into offices, a hotel or apartments and use the funds for a new primary care centre but nothing has ever happened. Today, the building continues to become more and more derelict.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> I understand the local community is fully behind the project to make it a refugee centre and is willing to do whatever it can to get the hospital ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">It is in the city centre, where there are many employment opportunities. It has schools and is a perfect location to house Ukrainian refugees.</p>
            <p eId="para_838"> I am asking the Minister of State to intervene as a matter of urgency and get the HSE to show some vision in getting this hospital back into operation as a centre for Ukrainian refugees. With a bit of goodwill on all sides and with the support of the local community, this could be done in a relatively short period. There is much local community support for this initiative and it is a shame that the HSE seems to be totally uninterested in furthering the project. To be brutally honest, the HSE is being negligent and must be reined in. The hospital must be taken from its dead man's grip.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_839">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. He is absolutely right that local communities have been to the fore over the past three months in responding to and welcoming our Ukrainian neighbours, who have had to flee their country. It is vital that Departments and public bodies work together to provide the best holistic response to ensure the safety of, and provide support to, people arriving in Ireland after fleeing conflict in Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> My Department and the HSE are working to ensure the provision of medical services to Ukrainian refugees, including the issuing of over 18,000 medical cards to date, co-ordinating disability service access and working closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the provision of a new national Ukraine arrivals accommodation transit and processing centre in Citywest. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is responsible for the provision of emergency refugee accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is focusing on the medium- and long-term accommodation challenges and leading cross-Government efforts through a housing task force established by the Government for this purpose. This work involves considering a number of options, including refurbishment and reconfiguration of vacant public and privately owned buildings as multi-occupancy accommodation for Ukrainian refugees. As part of this work, my Department and the HSE have submitted a list of potentially suitable properties to Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the aim that those that might be suitable for use as multi-occupancy accommodation can be brought into use for such purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> With specific regard to Baggot Street hospital, I can confirm that the building was identified by the HSE as a location with the potential to be used to provide accommodation for refugee housing. The Deputy is more familiar with the building than I am, and I have only seen it in passing the outside. It is a substantial building. The viability of the building for this purpose is contingent upon several factors, including the condition of the building and the nature of any required works. The timescale to complete any potential works is also a factor that must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> An initial feasibility report on Baggot Street hospital has been completed. The findings of the report are that the building, in its current state, is not habitable. The report also notes the added complexity of working with a protected structure because it is a listed building. The need for extensive works, particularly regarding necessary upgrades to electrical, plumbing and fire protection, are identified in the report. More in-depth surveys are required to scope what work would be required to bring the building up to even the most basic health and safety standards. Given the condition of the building, such surveys would be time-consuming.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> The report indicates that it is not possible to establish scope or timeframes for necessary works until all surveys are completed and statutory approvals and planning permissions are received. Nevertheless, substantial work and time would be necessary to bring the building to a habitable condition. It is the goal of the Government to provide the best possible support to refugees fleeing the Ukraine conflict, including providing suitable emergency and medium- to long-term accommodation in the initiatives under way. Any decision in respect of the Baggot Street hospital building will be taken in that context.</p>

          <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_269">
            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-05-24T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_845">The Government did not need a report to tell us the building is uninhabitable because a cursory look confirms it is not fit for anybody to live in. There is a development company that is willing to give labour for free and make it habitable. It wants to work with fire safety people to ensure it is habitable and safe. It could be used on an emergency basis and it is not a long-term solution for anybody for accommodation purposes. This is certainly an emergency and the Government must act accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_846"> I guessed that the Minister of State would say it is on the list. I also know the Government has no intention of taking on or fighting the HSE to get this from its grip. The gatekeepers in the HSE are determined to hold on to it. Baggot Street hospital is a monument to the failure of the Government's housing policy. It is a monument to the failure to address the homelessness crisis. It could have been opened ten or 15 years ago and housed Dublin's homeless population. Why did that not happen? The gatekeepers in the HSE and the Government were not willing to invest in it. As a result, it has been allowed to lie idle.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> It could have been developed to benefit the local community but that has not happened. If it had been developed years ago, we would not be in this crisis. It is very hard to understand how a building of this magnitude has been allowed to lie idle and become derelict.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">I thank the Deputy for his comments. I do not think anybody ten or 15 years ago could have pre-empted that Mr. Putin would invade Ukraine and had the building ready as a result. I do not have the history of the Baggot Street hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_850">I know it is a substantial building. I should be clear and will put this on the record again. The Deputy mentioned that the HSE has its fingers in this, but the HSE submitted a list of potentially suitable properties to the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government for use as multi-occupancy accommodation. Baggot Street hospital was included in that list. I am replying on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I take on board the Deputy's comments about a development company prepared to provide labour for free on this. Everybody is trying to work together to do the very best they can to ensure Ukrainian refugees can be housed in a good location and with the correct surroundings. I will certainly bring the suggestion to the Minister. It is a substantial offer from any developer in this day and age. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter tonight.</p>
