          <p eId="para_1">In September 2008 the Taoiseach gave this House and the country two guarantees: that the Government would stabilise the banking system and that it would provide for credit to flow to business.  He has failed on both counts and his strategy is in tatters.  The banks have been bailed out three times — by the guarantee, by recapitalisation, and by the passing of the National Assets Management Agency Bill — and they are now looking for more.  They are about to increase charges and interest rates on variable mortgages.  The response from Government has been silence.</p>

We would have been required to immediately repay €65 billion in funding to the European Central Bank, national central banks and other providers of funds.

This compares with an increase in February last year of more than 26,000.  The live register normally increases in February, so these figures suggest a modest decrease on a seasonally adjusted basis.  While unemployment remains at a high level, these figures confirm that the situation is stabilising.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_52">If he continues to carry on in his personal way, he will be on his own.  The people on the street are suffering in enraged silence at the carry-on and incompetence of the Government and what has happened here.  A total of 750 jobs are to go at Halifax and 200 at Bitech in Louth, while 260 are at risk at Postbank.  Bestseller Retail, with 14 stores and 80 jobs, is to close.<b/> At Boston Scientific, 175 hi-tech jobs are to be lost, as well as 170 at Debenhams, while 225 are at risk at Hughes and Hughes.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">The Taoiseach's comments indicate no appreciation of the pressure and stress being experienced by thousands of people all over the country every day.  When they look at this Cabinet, all they see is talk about jobs for the boys and the girls.  If it were not so serious it would be like "Lanigan's Ball".  We are led to believe from a news story broken on TV3 that Deputy Cuffe has the political carving knife to the throat of his leader, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  All that is being talked about are well paid and well pensioned jobs, when 434,000 men and women are on the live register because the Government's strategy has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">What is going up should be going down.  Bank interest rates, unemployment and house repossessions are rising, while loan approvals, business investment and tax receipts are still going down.  The Government will never break out of this cycle.  Unless jobs and an economic stimulus are a central issue at the Cabinet table, it cannot happen.  If the Government continues to cut people's pay and withdraw public investment, it will never address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The Government has skirted the issue for too long.  A central core of the failure of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government relates to economic stimulus and jobs.  The Taoiseach came in here this morning making smart comments.</p>

I will support the Taoiseach if he takes the Fine Gael economic plan for jobs and stimulus to put our country back to work, give our people confidence and restore some hope.  All he has done since September 2008 is destroy the lives, careers and opportunities for our people.  This is a potentially great country but the Government has failed to address the core issue.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at it now.</p>

The Labour Party made a proposal before the budget for the establishment of a jobs fund and a range of labour market interventions that would seek to get people back to work or at least access to the education and training they require to be better able to pick up employment and avail of business opportunities into the future.  Will the Taoiseach at least do that much soon?  There is an urgency in the employment issue and getting people back to work.

I met a hotelier recently whose overdraft facility was cut from €25,000 to €15,000.  Will the Taoiseach tell that man that the Government's banking policies are working?  Its banking policies are not working because credit is not going to business.  As it is not going to businesses, they are closing down and people are losing their jobs.  The Government's banking policy is not working because not a single loan has yet been transferred to NAMA.  The only thing that is happening with the Government's banking policy is that the clock is ticking all the time against the taxpayer, while the cost of the Government's approach to the banking system rising all the time.</p>

The Taoiseach chose not to run with them, but he should not come back and say that we have not produced constructive proposals, because we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">His problem with the public finances is that since he became Taoiseach, the size of the deficit has increased by €7 million every day due to the loss of employment.  Every job that is lost is costing around €20,000.  Jobs have been lost on his watch at the rate of 340 per day.  He can do the sums himself.  If people are out of work, there is less money in taxes coming into the Government.  If people are out of work, they are not spending and sales taxes are down.  That is why the Government has a problem with the public finances.  The Government's policies have failed to get the real economy moving again, to get businesses up and running again and to get people back into employment.  How much longer do people have to tolerate the Taoiseach, the Government and the misery that they are inflicting on those who are losing their jobs and suffering as a result of the collapse under his watch?</p>

            <p eId="para_185">I attended the forum on public procurement that was held in the Westbury Hotel last week.  An official from the European Commission who was present at that forum made the point that 17% of the contracts relating to tenders for public procurement in Ireland that are advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union are awarded to non-Irish companies based in other countries.  The EU average in this regard is only 1.5%.  If we are serious with regard to facilitating job creation and opportunities for Irish companies, will the Taoiseach explain why 17% of contracts relating to tenders for public procurement in Ireland are awarded to non-Irish companies based in other countries?  Is it his view that we are failing small business here in the context of the opportunities we can create for it to tender in respect of public procurement contracts or is it that the Government has not realised the potential for job creation that exists in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_186">I accept that my original question in this regard relates only to the Taoiseach's Department, which is one of the smallest Departments of State.  However, it is startling that 17% of the type of contracts to which I refer are awarded to companies based in other countries.  As already stated, the EU average is only 1.5%.  Cyprus is next nearest to Ireland in respect of this matter with a rate of 7.3%.  The position in this regard is extraordinary.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">I know that Ministers would be interested in Irish companies providing services and goods to Departments of State.  Will the Taoiseach comment on why Ireland is way above the EU average in respect of the award of these contracts to outside companies?  Something is radically wrong in this regard.  It is clear the opportunity to create thousands of jobs exists.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">The national public procurement operations unit was established in the Office of Public Works in April of last year on foot of a Government decision.  It is taking a lead role in modernising procurement practices across the public sector.  The report of the task force on the public service recommended greater use of shared services in the area of procurement.  The Government recognises the scope for improved value for money through increased professionalisation and co-ordination of public sector procurement.  To this end, a new national operations unit has been established within the Office of Public Works.  This unit is working to leverage the public service's buying power by organising procurement of common goods and services — such as office equipment, furniture, vehicles, electricity and fuel — across the public service.  Where better value for money can be obtained, the unit will further develop the e-tender system, including in the context of using e-options to allow for real-time, on-line billing.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The unit will also support a more professional approach towards public sector procurement through the provision of advice and the organisation of networks of procurement professionals.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, has policy responsibility for procurement and will drive the implementation of this new unit.  I understand that to date the unit has overseen savings of the order of €27 million among various Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">There are rules that apply in respect of procurement.  People are entitled to tender for contracts.  We are trying to ensure that everyone, including small businesses, will be in a position to tender and that tenders will be structured in such a way as to allow people to apply.  Ultimately, the procurement rules determine the outcome of the bids.  As already stated, we are trying to increase leverage across Departments and in the context of obtaining the best possible value for money, we must ensure that everyone, including Irish companies, is aware of this fact.  People must be also aware that a value-for-money drive is taking place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_191">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  It is unfortunate that, by virtue of the number of public procurement contracts awarded to non-Irish companies based in other countries, we are exporting our own business.  I am well aware of the rules that apply in respect of public procurement at both EU and national level.  The Taoiseach should request that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance carry out a complete audit of the rules and procedures relating to public procurement and report back to him within three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">I raised the matter of public procurement with the OECD a couple of weeks ago.  It is clear that there are massive savings to be made.  It is also clear that problems subsequently arise in the context of keeping down such savings.  I recently met an inspector at a meat factory who informed me that he cannot obtain a box of biros but that if his computer breaks down, someone will be sent from Dublin to fix it regardless of the cost involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">The Taoiseach and I are aware that cartels have been operating in the area of public procurement for a long period.  Some county managers appointed procurement officers within their local authorities and a number of them have seen to it that substantial savings — be these in respect of electricity costs, payments for machinery or whatever — were made within a short time.  There would be a real value in the Taoiseach informing the Minister of State at the Department of Finance that an audit should be carried out.  Every Department should have, through its own public procurement network, the capacity to make savings for the taxpayer while still obtaining real value for money.  If the Taoiseach does anything in this regard, it should be to set down the standard and issue an instruction to the Minister of State that he should provide, within three months, a report relating to a complete audit of the public procurement rules — EU and national — that apply in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">We all want Irish companies to do well.  Such companies are quite prepared to step up to the mark if they get the opportunity to do so.  I have met the owners of many of the small firms, particularly those operating in the area of printing, etc., who indicated that they cannot even avail of the opportunity to tender as a result of the complexities of the system and the costs involved.  It appears that, year after year, contracts are awarded to the same companies.  That may well be happening on a strictly competitive basis, which is fine.  However, there is real potential for small and larger businesses to avail of the massive opportunities that exist in the context of job creation, the provision of services and obtaining value for money.  The Taoiseach would do the country a useful service if he were to demand a complete audit and an overhaul of the way public procurement contracts are awarded.</p>

            <p eId="para_195">In recent weeks I held meetings with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works at which we discussed the issue of procurement.  The main aim of national policy on procurement is to achieve value for money while also having regard to probity and accountability.  While price is very important in determining value for money outcomes in procurement and for certain categories of purchases in particular, it is not the only variable that needs to be considered.  Value for money also encompasses non-cost factors.  When making purchases of goods or services consideration should be given to whether they are fit for the purpose for which they are intended, whether the goods or services provided are of sufficient quality and whether the level of service or support provided meets the requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">There are other issues that should be also considered, including whole-of-life and transaction costs associated with acquiring, using, holding, maintaining and disposing of the goods or service.  Value for money in procurement is, therefore, the optimum combination of whole-life-costs and-or price, where appropriate, and quality or fitness for purpose to meet the user's requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">The increasing complexity and importance of purchasing decisions by public bodies is leading to a need for a more strategic focus and improved management of the public procurement process.  Effective and efficient procurement policy, procedures and practices by public bodies can have a significant impact on the accountability and value for money aspects of the purchase of goods and services by the State.  The potential for real savings from more effective procurement policies and practices is significant.  Achieving savings is important as it frees up resources which can be redirected to the provision of services within organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">Departments are required and expected to include procurement management reform as one of the key strategic priorities and aims in their statements of strategy or other key strategic documents.  They are also expected to develop appropriate corporate procurement plans.  On foot of the production of the latter, they are further expected to develop plans in respect of significant purchases.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">The national public procurement policy requires each Department to prepare plans when making significant purchases of goods and services.  These are purchases which have been identified by the purchasing body as being of high relative expenditure and or where securing supply can be difficult or is critical to the operation of the public body.  Significant purchases can be characterised as those that represent the majority of a purchasing body's spend; they are generally complex in terms of demand and supply; and individually they can have a significant impact on a purchasing body's operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">We are in the process of ensuring that all Departments are not simply acting individually but are pulling together where asked to by the OPW to ensure we get the best possible value for money for specific items.  Categories targeted this year include advertising, clothing and footwear for Garda Síochána and Defence Force uniforms, energy, electricity, gas, liquid bulk fuels, liquified petroleum gas, fuel charge cards, IT consumables, office supplies, stationery, office equipment, printing and transport.  All of this is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">To answer a previous question, my Department incurs operating expenditure across a range of goods and services such as travel, staff training and development, telecommunications, office equipment, maintenance of premises, information technology, library costs, consultancy, printing and other incidental costs.  On average, these costs are approximately €3 million each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">On the previous occasion that these questions were addressed I asked the Taoiseach whether a policy was in place or would be put in place that would favour the allocation of contracts for the provision of goods or services from Irish manufacturers where possible.  In his reply, the Taoiseach indicated, as he repeated today, that for goods and services over a particular value we are obliged to put the contract out to tender to notify all competitors throughout the European Union.  However, on that occasion the Taoiseach stated, "I am always of the view that if there is very little in the difference, one should give it to an Irish firm, although that must be legal and appropriate."  Is there a policy in place or will one be put in place to ensure where possible that an Irish source is given the opportunity to provide goods or services in line with the Taoiseach's stated reply?  Has he built on the view he expressed on the previous occasion over the interim period?  Can it be the practice where the value of the goods required is under whatever value is the current guideline for wider EU notification that Irish-made products and Irish-provided services, on the basis of their being of high standard and good value, will be preferred in all such situations in a serious effort to help retain existing jobs and create new jobs throughout all of those service providers and manufacturers?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_203">The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is very important to the national economy and it is recognised that public procurement can be an important source of business for them.  The national public procurement policy unit in the Department of Finance promotes policies which facilitate SME participation in public procurement and the national public procurement operations unit established in 2009 will act as a centre of excellence for the provision of procurement advice and implementation of procurement policy in line with best practice and Government initiatives, including improved access to public procurement opportunities for SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">A number of practical provisions are in place to ensure that SMEs can access public procurement opportunities.  These include the existing guidelines to contracting authorities which require that they encourage new businesses to apply for smaller public contracts and establish a track record which can enable them to progress to competing for larger contracts.  In establishing frameworks for the supply of goods and services, contracting authorities are asked to consider how proposed arrangements will impact on SMEs.  In these situations, while total demand may be aggregated requirements will generally be drawn down in small lots, in many cases following mini competitions.  In selecting participants, authorities are asked to ensure that where smaller enterprises can meet requirements or compete for particular lots, the terms of the framework should facilitate their inclusion.  It is pointed out that there will be instances where flexibility and an ability to respond speedily to requirements will place such enterprises in a particularly favourable position to participate and compete effectively.  Under public procurement rules, pre-qualification criteria must be proportionate and relevant to the needs of the contract.  Contracting authorities must be careful to avoid setting unnecessarily high requirements in pre-qualifying tenders for public contracts which may act as a deterrent to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">The public procurement website, <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>, is a national resource available to contracting authorities and suppliers which increases transparency and greatly facilitates access to public sector contracts.  While current guidelines require contracting parties to advertise contracts with estimated values of more than €50,000 for supplies and service contracts on this website, this threshold is not absolute and a recent survey showed that some authorities advertised contracts ranging from €10,000 upwards as standard practice.  It is generally recognised that advertising of these opportunities promotes SME participation.  By registering as a supplier on this site, other facilities are available to potential suppliers, including e-mail alerts to suppliers when notices of interest to them have been published and a facility to secure online submission of tenders by suppliers which can simplify the tendering process and associated expense for smaller suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">Contracting authorities are strongly encouraged to communicate long-term purchasing plans to the market as early as possible by publishing what are known as "prior information notices" on the website.  These minimise the barriers for SMEs associated with timelines involved in tendering processes by giving smaller businesses time to react and prepare for the tender process with regard to developing partnerships with other smaller companies and identifying innovative solutions or sub-contracting opportunities with larger companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">The Buying Innovation ten-step guide, published by the procurement innovation group established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, highlights the role that SMEs can play in smart and innovative procurement.  Creative ideas for new and innovative solutions and products can come from small and medium enterprises.  Contracting authorities can promote their participation by encouraging joint bids from SMEs, affording sub-contracting opportunities or, where appropriate and practical without compromising efficiency and value for money, dividing contracts into lots.  Contracting authorities can also encourage new and innovative solutions by indicating in tender documents that they are prepared to accept variants to the specification where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">For certain requirements, contracting authorities may need access to technical knowledge to research the market for solutions, draw up specifications and evaluate proposals.  It is important that contracting authorities consult with the market before tendering as it enables them to understand and identify new developments in the marketplace and what types of companies, including new SMEs, can provide solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">SMEs are acknowledged as key suppliers of eco-innovation, as many are engaged in developing and providing specialist and innovative green products and services.  Encouraging sub-contracting is an important aspect of securing the best possible solution for contracting authorities.  It also benefits larger companies by enabling them to strike up collaborative partnerships with small innovative firms engaged in cutting edge technology.  As can be seen, a real effort is being made to ensure that SMEs can participate and be given adequate prior notice.</p>

            <p eId="para_210">I acknowledge that the Taoiseach's reply supports that.  I wish to follow on from what Deputy Kenny requested.  Perhaps an exercise should be undertaken at this point to evaluate the success of what the Taoiseach has just read into the record.  I have no doubt we are all on the same page in what we want to achieve in terms of small and medium enterprises.  It is in all our interests that we know exactly how successful or otherwise this approach and endeavour has been.  Will the Taoiseach agree to initiate an evaluation of the success of the measures about which he has just informed us; to carry out a study of all the various procurement opportunities that have presented over a given period of 12 months, two years or three years; to do a comparative study as to how successful that has been; and to learn from the exercise where this can be either tweaked or better marketed in terms of Irish small and medium enterprises in order that we can maximise the potential for all of those either in manufacturing or in service provision?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do that because it is not enough just to rest on the stated intent.  We need to know how successful it has been.  I believe we collectively want to ensure that it is the most successful that it can be.</p>

            <p eId="para_211">The unit we set up in the Office of Public Works, which will be 12 months in existence in April, has been pulling together and avoiding the silo effect of having individual departmental public procurement operations.  There is a need to co-ordinate and pull together in order to leverage on behalf of the taxpayer the best possible value for money.  Savings have been identified and that will continue.  When one is seeking greater value for money, trying to get one's tender prices down and to effect savings, that means tenderers have to meet those requirements.  In some cases new tenderers come from outside and put in a better tender.  In an ideal world all of the jobs would go to Irish firms based on the rules but in the context of how tendering works it is not possible to guarantee that.  Dividing up the contracts into lots and implementing the practical measures I have outlined greatly facilitates smaller companies to work together with similar companies to put in joint bids.  There is huge flexibility.  The e-tender system and the availability of that unit is a resource for Irish companies which they can contact directly and be apprised of the requirements and how they might be able to better improve their success rate if they have been unsuccessful in terms of securing the work they are seeking out.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">Strengthening remedies are available to candidates who feel their rights have been infringed in the award of public contracts to improve the opportunities for unsuccessful tenderers to challenge unlawful awards and increase the possible penalties on contracting authorities for making such awards.  In the case of contracts awarded in a serious breach of the rules the courts are given powers to annul the contract by declaring it ineffective.  There is a strong requirement to ensure that the tendering documentation itself is correct in the first instance to avoid subsequent legal challenge and to ensure that the job is done right.  As Deputy Ó Caoláin indicated, there is keen competition and people are advised in many instances as to why they have not been successful and where they may have been placed in the overall tendering process after the decision is made.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">During Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach challenged me and Deputy Kenny to name one measure on which we support the Government.  I wish to start with public procurement.  The Labour Party supports the recommendations that are contained in the McCarthy report on public procurement.  Those recommendations are not insignificant.  The McCarthy report proposes that there could be a reduction of approximately €300 million in public procurement in a full year if certain measures are taken and that they could be achieved by 2012.  The Labour Party is on record as saying that those are good recommendations, that they should be supported and that we support them.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">I wish to ask the Taoiseach a couple of questions about how he is implementing the recommendations.  The McCarthy report recommended that a panel of experts should be formed to drive the professionalisation of procurement.  Has that panel of experts been established and will the Taoiseach indicate to the House who is on it?  Second, the McCarthy report recommended that reforms should be extended into supply chain management and inventory control in all public authorities.  Has that been done?</p>
            <p eId="para_217">Third, the McCarthy report recommended that a number of Departments, including Health and Children, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be required to review current arrangements in detail and to submit to Government no later than the end of 2009 a detailed statement of reforms they propose in supply chain management and inventory control in all public authorities in their sectors to deliver aggregate savings building up to €300 million in a full year by 2012.  Has that been done?  Could the Taoiseach inform the House whether the Departments produced the reports by 2009, which I presume they must have by now, and what is the total estimate of savings?</p>

I do not deal with that area.  I just sought to be helpful in terms of broadening out the question beyond my Department's procurement plan, which was the question asked.  I am sure we can get the details and forward them to the Deputy.  A question to the Office of Public Works would give the details sought by Deputy Gilmore.  Reforms and improvements to internal procurement systems and processes are taking place.  We are working on a range of areas to improve procurement.  That is why we set up the office in the first place.  A question addressed to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will help to bring the Deputy up to date on all those issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">With respect, one of the questions I asked was about reports that were to have been brought to Government by a number of Departments by the end of 2009.  To the best of my knowledge the Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works does not attend Cabinet meetings so I am asking the Taoiseach whether those reports on public procurement recommended by the McCarthy report from a number of line Departments by the end of 2009 were brought to Government.  Has that happened?  I imagine the Taoiseach would remember that, as the amount of money involved is significant.  Mr. McCarthy suggested there was a potential for savings of €300 million in a full year.  Have the line Departments brought those reports to Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_220">Has the Taoiseach heard anything about the panel of experts the McCarthy report recommended should be established to assist Government in professionalising public procurement?

            <p eId="para_238">The Deputy makes a fair point.  When there are open public procurement rules in all countries, there will be occasions where non-nationals in the various jurisdictions obtain work.  That is the case in a range of areas.  I do not have the exact detail to hand on that but I accept the point the Deputy has made.  In regard to Irish companies who are successful elsewhere but find themselves unable to be successful at home, that is a concern we all share.  As I said, direct contact with the national procurement unit is advised and promoted so that businesses will have a clear view of the situation and how their tendering applications can be improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">It should be borne in mind that larger countries tender to a far greater extent for goods and services than is the case here.  It may be the case that some Irish companies are winning tenders abroad because there are a greater number of outlets and opportunities and the number of contracts are perhaps more varied and more suitable.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  I too am aware of companies that are doing business abroad but have not been successful in doing similar business at home.  That is a matter of disappointment and concern.  For any business seeking business abroad, the first question asked of its representatives is what it is getting at home for its service or goods.  A company that is not getting the business at home is presumably at a disadvantage when its representatives go to the United States or wherever to drum up business.  The purpose of the establishment of the national procurement unit is to facilitate businesses to the greatest extent possible, and consistent with legal requirements, to tender for work.  Public sector work is increasingly important in the context of decreased private sector activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">The cost of the Moriarty tribunal to my Department in 2008 was €4.01 million.  The total expenditure for my Department from the establishment of the tribunal in September 1997 to 31 December 2009 was €38.27 million.  The sole member of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Moriarty, has not yet addressed third-party costs.  Until that is done, we cannot estimate the overall cost of the tribunal with any accuracy.  The tribunal secretariat has on many occasions over the years told my Department that any attempt by the tribunal to quantify third-party costs would lead to conclusions being drawn and suppositions being made which could infringe the rights of witnesses and impinge on the independence of the tribunal.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report on Tribunals of Inquiry, in attempting to establish some estimate of the overall cost of the Moriarty tribunal, gave various ranges for third-party costs but stressed that the figures were subject to many caveats and contingencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">From time to time there have been requests to my Department for files and information from various tribunals.  The Department has co-operated fully with all such requests and will continue to do so in the future.  Normally such requests are received by the Secretary General of my Department and assigned to the appropriate departmental officials by him.  Appropriate replies subsequently issue when the requests have been considered and any relevant information or files identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_249">When I raised this matter with the Taoiseach some weeks ago the information available to him was that the report of the Moriarty tribunal was expected to be published in March.  Recent announcements suggest this may not be the case.  Has the Taoiseach been informed as to whether additional witnesses are to be called?  If so, does that mean the tribunal report may well be delayed for a further undetermined period?  Has he been officially told that other witnesses are to be called which will delay the publication date of the report?</p>

            <p eId="para_250">The tribunal is independent in the conduct of its proceedings, including the selection and timing of witnesses' appearances before it.  I understand the tribunal has called two additional State witnesses and has written to the affected parties informing them of the intention to hear additional witnesses from the Attorney General's office.  As of this morning no date has been set for the hearing.</p>

            <p eId="para_251">It will delay the tribunal for a further period if those two witnesses are called and give evidence that may give rise to further questions.  The final cost of the tribunal has been estimated to be approximately €100 million, including third party legal costs.  Can the Taoiseach indicate the scale of the legal fees that have been paid to lawyers for the tribunals in respect of what has been a very long time?  If he does not have this information to hand, he might forward it to me.</p>

            <p eId="para_252">I understand from the tribunal that it will not be able to give a timescale for completion of its report until after the witnesses have been heard and their evidence assessed.  I have no intention of commenting in any way on the work of the tribunal.  As for questions on the cost and duration of the tribunal, tribunals undoubtedly are an expensive way of carrying out investigations.  This is the reason the Government has introduced the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill that is before the House at present.  As for the length of time the tribunal has taken, I should point out it has published the first part of its report.  Moreover, I believe the  tribunal itself would point out that it has been subject to legal challenge, which also has taken time.  It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the final overall costs until third party costs have been assessed.  As I stated, the cost of the tribunal to this Department to the end of 2009 was €38.27 million and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report indicated that the cost to other State bodies up to the end of 2007 was €10.9 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_253">When I last questioned the Taoiseach on this issue on 4 November, he informed me that it was the sole member's intention that the report would be ready for publication in early January.  On the following day, 5 November, an article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> that quoted a source with knowledge of the tribunal’s affairs which stated that the early January date was unrealistic and that it was not expected that it would report by early January.  Can the Taoiseach now give the House an indication as to when the tribunal might report? </p>
            <p eId="para_254">There have been reports that the Moriarty tribunal has now agreed to call new witnesses from the Office of the Attorney General.  As the latter office reports to this House through the Taoiseach at Taoiseach's Question Time, what is the Taoiseach's information on the witnesses who are likely to be called from the Office of the Attorney General?  How many witnesses has he been informed are likely to be called and what is his estimate of the likely length of time this further calling of witnesses and hearing of their evidence will take?</p>

            <p eId="para_255">I have no idea how long it will take.  That is a matter for the tribunal and I do not comment on the working of the tribunal at all for obvious reasons.  I understand the tribunal has called two additional State witnesses, that the affected parties have been written to informing them of the intention to hear additional witnesses from the Attorney General's office and as I understand it as of this morning, no date has been set for the hearing.  However, I am not in a position to comment further on how long that might take.  That evidence must be given, adduced and assessed and thereafter it will be a matter for the sole member.</p>

            <p eId="para_256">Again, when Members last addressed these questions in November, I made reference to the fact that the previous July, it had been indicated at the Committee of Public Accounts that the Moriarty tribunal had paid €8.5 million each to two barristers working in the tribunal.  I described such payments as an obscenity and asked the Taoiseach the reason that the reduction in fees signalled in 2004 had not proceeded over the five years up to that point last July or up to Question Time in November.  In his extraordinary reply the Taoiseach stated, "The strong view was that the imposition of the reduced rate could lead to the departure of counsel to the jeopardy of the money already expended on the work of the tribunal".  At what point in time and by what means did senior counsel or someone on their behalf either threaten or seek to bluff in respect of how they might respond in the event of the introduction of a reduction in fees?  Would the Taoiseach not have thought it appropriate either to face down the threat or to call their bluff?  As for the argument or view that these senior counsel would walk, resulting in an absolute loss of all the years of effort employed and putting in jeopardy all that already had been expended in the tribunal up to that point in time, I do not believe it holds any water.  Where stands this matter at present?</p>

            <p eId="para_257">The Government acted on advice at the time.  This issue has been dealt with a number of times at Question Time and I do not wish to go through the same questions as the same replies are available now as I have put on the record of the House previously.  The Deputy is aware that anything the Government does in this situation that might have an effect like the one mentioned would lead to it being accused of seeking to orchestrate something that was not its intention.  It was a question of being obliged to deal with the situation that arose.  An error did arise as I have explained in detail in previous comments.  It has been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts with the Accounting Officer concerned and has been explained there as well.  I have nothing further to add except to state that the Government is anxious that this matter should be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  However, that is a matter for the sole member and I do not comment on the workings of the tribunal beyond that for fear of being misinterpreted.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Lowry</from>
            <p eId="para_259">I wish to ask one question of the Taoiseach.  How can the Taoiseach or any Member of this House justify what ultimately will be the multi-million cost of this tribunal?  I have 13 years of experience in dealing with this tribunal and have come to the opinion that this quasi-judicial legal farce has been out of control for years.  The Oireachtas has stood back from it and has allowed it to continue.  Although Members this morning have been discussing the economy being in tatters, they are still observing and sanctioning daily payments to senior counsel, including Saturdays and Sunday, on which expenses have been drawn.  Were the Taoiseach to examine the invoices going into his Department from the tribunal, he would see that after 13 years, senior counsel are paid €2,500, now reduced to €2,250, per day.  Moreover, in some instances they are claiming for Saturdays and Sundays.  How can the Government justify such expenditure of public funds on an ongoing basis, while at the same time it has reduced social welfare payments, is cutting the public service pay bill, has removed medical cards from people who deserve them and is reducing the health services and funding for hospitals?</p>
            <p eId="para_260">In respect of the costs, how could the officials in the Department of the Taoiseach who are responsible for the tribunal allow senior barristers for the tribunal, who now are multimillionaires on foot of their work there, to submit bills that were incorrect and which were overstated by €250 per day, amounting to millions of euro——</p>

            <p eId="para_262">—— without claiming it back?  Why was this money not claimed back from these barristers?  Were social welfare recipients involved, they would have been harassed and hounded to ensure the moneys were repaid.  I have come to the conclusion that the officials in the Department of the Taoiseach have allowed this tribunal to become untouchables, particularly the barristers involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">I also wish to correct the record.  The witnesses from the Attorney General's office were not called back by Mr. Justice Moriarty.  They were called back because he was forced to do so, as otherwise, he would have a High Court hearing this morning.</p>

            <p eId="para_264">With the introduction of the new Tribunals of Inquiry Bill and the Commissions of Investigation Act, which we have passed, there is an acknowledgement in the House that we need to deal with matters of urgent public importance in ways alternative to what has been the case under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.</p>
            <p eId="para_265">I am aware that Deputy Lowry has close involvement with and knowledge of these matters and that they have gone on for a very long time.  I make the case for the Government, in that we wish to see these matters brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible in the interests of everybody.  In future, this House needs to consider carefully the question of the use of the 1921 Act, as we have brought forward more modern enactments that can more speedily deal with issues that the Oireachtas may need to have investigated from time to time because they are matters of urgent public importance.  In matters of urgent public importance, a length of time is taken because of a range of issues, including challenges that have been made.  People are entitled to vindicate their rights in court in respect of any issue that arises based on their legal advice or their own opinion as to how matters should be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">I make these general points and say that we await finalisation of all of these matters as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The Labour Party cannot agree to this motion being taken without debate.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has existed since the 1970s.  The National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, was established with a wider remit.  Some time later, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance was established.  Then the Government decided that it would establish an umbrella body for the three organisations, the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO.  This required legislation, which took years to trundle its way through the House.  Now, we are apparently being presented with a formula in which the umbrella will be kept and the bodies under it will be amalgamated.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">There is probably a good rationale for doing this, but we should hear it.  The Minister with responsibility should state the case in the House and provide an opportunity to Opposition parties to comment on whether we support or disagree with the rationale or whether the Government got things wrong in the first place by having a multiplicity of bodies that, in some instances, deal with the same public business.  Having set up all of those bodies through legislation, it is not acceptable for the Government to tell the House that it wants to dissolve them without debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">My objection is to the proposal that No. 20 be taken without debate.  If the Taoiseach will say that an hour or whatever will be provided for a debate, the Labour Party will be happy to have it taken, but we will not agree to it being taken without debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The Sinn Féin Members do not agree to taking this motion, which seeks approval for the dissolution of the NESF without debate.  It is not acceptable, as this matter should be debated.  When one considers it against the backdrop of the Government having already abolished the Combat Poverty Agency at a time in which more and more people are being driven into poverty, it would appear that the Government is intent on abolishing all of the watchdog bodies that have been established over the years.  This is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Over the years, the NESF has produced many fine reports.  Some of what it has produced has found its way into Government policy, but much of its focus, which is mainly concentrated on issues of equality and social inclusion, has not been taken up by the Government.  More than likely, it was an embarrassment to the Government.  This is what is behind the proposition to abolish the NESF.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">From the Sinn Féin point of view, it is not only taking the matter without debate that would be opposed by our Members.  We would oppose the proposition full stop.  This body has played a useful and worthwhile role and the quality of its material over the years, including the 2002 report on equity in acute hospital care, the 2005 report on the large child care deficit and its last report in October concerning the home care package scheme, which the NESF claimed was being stymied by bad implementation, has been critical.  The reports were valued and welcomed by those who want to see equity and social inclusion in this State.</p>

Is he aware of an apparent internal or secret arrangement which might oblige him to make other adjustments to the personnel in his Cabinet?  What has been leaked from the Green Party is its own business, but if it is true this is a matter of considerable public importance.  It is important that Deputy Cowen, while he is Taoiseach, has the best possible working arrangement with his coalition partners.  An arrangement whereby the Taoiseach relies on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on one day but finds, without any direct input by himself, that there is a different Minister the next day, does not seem to be a suitable one.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Deputies McManus and Coveney have tabled questions about the statutory instrument, under the Broadcasting Act, made by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in respect of an increase in a levy which will mean redundancies in local radio stations throughout the country.  These local radio stations do not object to the payment of a levy but what is involved here is excessive.  I ask that the Dáil have an opportunity to discuss this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">Under what standing order are you making that ruling, a Cheann Comhairle?  This matter is strictly in order.  I merely seek Government time for discussion of the details of this statutory instrument.  It is a matter of considerable importance to people throughout the country.  I respectfully suggest that there be some discussion on it.  We cannot amend a statutory instrument.  It is either passed or not.  If the House decides to reject the statutory instrument a different one, with a lower levy requirement, could be made.  I ask the Taoiseach to deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">On 11 December 2009, the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport.  This followed a petition, facilitated by Mr. Jim Higgins MEP, by the parents of three young women who had lost their lives in road accidents in Ireland.  The Committee on Petitions listened to the parents' arguments about the requirement for road safety standards and signage in Ireland.  While the appropriate directive refers to trans-European networks, the members of the Committee on Petitions nevertheless decided to write to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport to ask that the parents of the three young women who lost their lives be invited to give the evidence they gave to the European Committee on Petitions to the Joint Committee on Transport.  There has not been a response and I suggest that, out of public interest and because of the commitment shown by the parents of those young women in following this matter through, that the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Frank Fahey, invite them to attend the joint committee for a discussion on road signage, road safety and road alignment, arising from the fact that their daughters lost their lives in accidents because of incompetence by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It would be appropriate to get away from hiding behind the fact that statements were made in the House about the lost at sea scheme.  Deputy Michael Creed raised this matter on a number of occasions.  Questions remain to be asked and answers can be given.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">Yesterday, I raised the issue of Statutory Instrument No. 7 of 2010 which deals with the levy scheme which will affect local radio stations.  Events have moved on significantly since yesterday.  This morning, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, a motion proposed by the Chairman that this scheme be annulled was unanimously agreed.  The motion received all-party support from Government and Opposition members.  In light of the fact that  Opposition and Government Deputies have lost confidence in this statutory instrument, the Government must either withdraw the measure or put it to a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We cannot allow local radio stations to be bled dry because of decisions made at Government level.  An authority has been set up and a levy scheme instituted in which Members on neither side of the House have confidence.  We all support the principle but I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the statutory instrument is withdrawn and a full review carried out.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is already committed to carrying out a review but this cannot be done on the basis that the scheme stays in place.  We have time but it is limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The joint committee has unanimously agreed that Statutory Instrument No. 7 of 2010 be annulled.  I urge the Taoiseach to listen to his own Deputies, as well as those on this side of the House, who want to make sure that broadcasting is regulated but also that the cost of that regulation is appropriate to the times and fairly distributed on the broadcasting industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">We do not need to divide on this issue if the Government is willing to facilitate a revocation of the statutory instrument, which was put before the House on 28 January.  The levy order will take effect if we choose not to annul it within 21 working days of the Dáil.  That period runs out next Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Following significant discussion this morning, the BAI has agreed to come back to the joint committee to discuss its budget for 2010 and the levy required to raise it.  On that basis, the joint committee has submitted a motion that the order be annulled, pending further consideration of the authority's budget by the joint committee.  That motion was proposed by the Chairman, who is a member of a Government party.  We request that the Government facilitate that annulment order before next Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">It is unusual that events develop in this way but it is appropriate that the joint committee's proposal be followed at this point.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_314">I support the case presented by the previous speakers.  We must recognise that the levy, as proposed by the BAI, is on top of what is a very straitened economic situation for all of these local radio stations.  There has been at least a 30% reduction in advertising revenue as a result of the downturn in the economy and this is presenting even more in terms of local rurally based radio stations than the national broadcaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">It is very important that any imposition is evaluated in the context of the ever more difficult economic situation presenting where staff numbers have already been reduced and where the risk is that one could see some of these stations being forced out of business, and that is not a result anyone here would want to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The annulment should be supported as it has already been recorded as being supported by all political opinion at committee.  It should be reflected further here and action should be taken, as appropriate, within the short time remaining.</p>

Any surplus of levy income or over-expenditure in a given year can be offset against levy obligations the following year or refunded to the industry.

          <p eId="para_368">I want to establish whether this is true or whether it has just been put out there.  Has the Taoiseach been informed that there is an arrangement for the rotation of Ministers in the Green Party?  If he has been notified of that arrangement, why has he not informed the House of it before now and if on foot of it, he expects to come before the House to nominate new members for appointment by the President to be members of the Government?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the arrangement Senator Boyle announced to the nation last night that the Green Party is to have a second Minister of State appointed?</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The next issue I raise also relates to the Constitution.  The Government is responsible to the Dáil under the Constitution.  One of the ways that responsibility is exercised is by Members of the Dáil asking parliamentary questions of Ministers.  It has been the case from time to time that a question is tabled but a Minister cannot answer it or he or she must take time to assemble the information or whatever and we all understand that.  However, in recent weeks there has been a pattern in the replies to Members. For example, 58 parliamentary questions were tabled to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">Of the 58 written questions tabled to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs yesterday, 43 or 74% of the replies were along the following lines: "Due to staff action currently being taken, I regret that I am unable to provide the information sought by the Deputy".  Of the six questions tabled to the Minister for Defence, a role the Taoiseach recently assumed, a similar reply was provided in three cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Deputies who table a question to a Minister are asking the Minister for a reply, not the Civil Service.  Ministers are constitutionally obliged to respond to questions by providing a real reply rather than the type of reply to which I referred.  If they are unable to fulfil their constitutional obligations to the House and its Members and cannot organise, administer and manage their Departments in such a way that they are in a position to provide replies to the Dáil, the Government is dysfunctional and perhaps it should consider options on how to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Deputies, as Members of Parliament, are entitled to receive a reply when they ask a parliamentary question and Ministers are constitutionally obliged to provide a reply to the House.  While Deputies may be sympathetic when a Minister has a problem with staff in his or her office or whatever the case may be, the Minister is still obliged to provide an answer to the House.  If Ministers are in a position that they cannot provide a normal written reply to the Dáil in the manner sought by Deputies, alternative arrangements will have to be made for them to come into the House and provide the answers orally.</p>

The Taoiseach told the House previously that he has to get approval from the European Commission before such legislation can be implemented.  I raised the matter the week before last with the Tánaiste.  Would it be possible to sign the statutory instrument, pending approval from the European Commission, in light of the fact that it is similar to legislation that has been passed in the UK and has already been with the Commission for the past two months?  It is also similar to legislation that has already been enacted in other EU countries to ban some of these toxic chemicals.  It would address the issue of these shops advertising their products as being legal.

          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_459">In practical terms this amendment seeks to define the expression "maximum fine" for the purpose of the use of that expression in section 8, which provides for an increase in the amount of certain fines on conviction or indictment.  The amendment seeks to include in the meaning of "maximum fine" a fixed fine and, in effect — if I can use a non-legal term — to unfix it.  We do not have many fixed fines on the Statute Book. Such fines usually relate to Revenue offences.  For example, section 65(1) of the Finance Act 2008 requires that conviction for the offence of contravening or failing to comply with provisions concerning electricity taxes, without prejudice to any other penalty to which the person may be liable, carry a penalty of €5,000.  Fines are fixed for a reason.  The fact they are fixed implies the sponsoring Department wishes to provide an unchanging level of penalty as a response to particular types of offences.  It would not be appropriate to provide that such penalties could be raised automatically along with other fines.  There is an opportunity for the sponsoring Department to review such fines annually during the preparation of Finance Acts and there is little chance of them falling out of date.  I understand the thinking behind the amendment and appreciate the effort made on Committee Stage.  I have consulted with the draftsmen and it has been decided it would not be appropriate to include fixed fines in an indexing provision.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

Clearly, it would be legally improper to impose the new penalties on persons convicted after the commencement date for an offence committed before the commencement date.  The European Convention on Human Rights expressly states that a higher penalty than the penalty enforced at the material time of the offence cannot be imposed on a person.  This amendment will avoid any challenge based on this point by making clear that the new penalties will only apply to offences committed on, or after, the commencement date.</p>

The inclusion of the first three of the Deputy's amendments would seem to obviate the necessity for the following three.  We asked the draftsman of the legislation to consider what the Deputy was trying to achieve, based on what he said on Committee Stage.  We feel it is just a matter of drafting technique and there is no need to change it.  However, in view of what the Deputy has said, we will take another look at the issue.

          <p eId="para_543">The basis of this amendment is that the 2007 version of the Bill, in section 7(5), sets forth a minimum fine on indictment of €10,000 for fines set prior to the commencement date.  This has disappeared from the Bill, although it seems an appropriate provision to maintain the hierarchy of penalties between summary conviction and conviction on indictment.  We suggest that this be re-inserted.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">These amendments were introduced on Committee Stage and are designed to ensure that when a person is convicted on indictment for a criminal offence and the court decides the appropriate penalty is a fine, the level of the fine that can be imposed will be no less than €10,000.  On Committee Stage I undertook to consult the Attorney General on any legal or constitutional implications that might arise, and I did so.  Deputy Sherlock stated that the Fines Bill 2007 provided for a minimum fine of €10,000 on conviction on indictment and that all his amendments seek to do is to restate that policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Following a full re-examination of the provision of the 2007 Bill, it was decided that some elements could be improved.  It was also decided to greatly expand the scope of the Bill.  That is why it was withdrawn and replaced by this Bill.  The main provision that we believed could be improved was section 7, as it was considered to be unnecessarily complicated and restrictive.  It has been replaced by what is now section 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I would not agree that the 2007 Bill provided for a minimum fine of €10,000.  Rather, it replaced all fines on indictment with a maximum value of less than €10,000 in specific Acts with a maximum fine of €10,000.  The amendments would unnecessarily reduce, to an extent, the discretion of judges when deciding on the appropriate fine to impose in a particular case.  I thank the Deputy for the amendments but, having considered the position, I cannot accept them.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I have a long note so I will read it and then we can have a discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The Fines Bill as discussed and as passed on Committee Stage contains a range of proposals aimed at ensuring that the level of fines imposed by the courts on persons convicted of committing offences will be affordable to the offender and, where default on payment occurs, a range of alternative sanctions is available.  Briefly, in practical terms, this means that where a fine is imposed the court will be able to increase or reduce the fine within statutory limits in accordance with the offender's ability to pay.  This means that payment of the fine will not cause any financial hardship to the offender or his or her dependants.  In addition, the court may allow the fine to be paid in instalments over a 12-month period, which may in exceptional cases be extended for a further 12 months.  Thus, the court will have an obligation to take into account the financial circumstances of the person being fined in determining the amount of the fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Despite the provisions for equality of impact and payment by instalment, not everyone will pay his or her fine.  There will be various reasons for this.  In some cases people will forget, although administrative provisions are being established to remind people of their obligations; others will not pay for reasons of principle or contrariness, while some simply could not be bothered because of general antipathy towards the law of the State and its institutions.  That is why I have provided alternatives to imprisonment.  The purpose of the amendments we are now discussing is to set out in more detail how they will operate in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Deputies on the opposite side of the House have raised the issue of the number of bench warrants that are outstanding, many of which are for relatively small fines that are not collected.  This has been a source of much complaint in recent years.  There is a considerable onus on the Garda to execute those warrants, which means that in some instances a person who has forgotten to pay will find himself being taken to Mountjoy prison by a Garda under a court order, having been sentenced to seven days' imprisonment in default.  In the Department we spent much time considering the provision of alternatives to imprisonment.  These amendments are the way forward, although I am open to any suggestions from the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The current draft provides for making a recovery order, the appointment of a receiver and the imposition of community service.  The receiver would only have been appointed in instances of default on large fines imposed in higher courts, and the effect of the recovery order would have been to transform the non-payment of the fine into civil debt.  I have decided to fuse these orders into one new recovery order, under which the court can appoint an approved person or receiver to recover the fine or its value.  The use of this formula avoids the duplication of having two similar orders and having to arrange additional court hearings to effectively repeat investigating the offender's capacity to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Streamlining the orders leads me to the main purpose of these amendments; instead of giving the courts power to impose imprisonment for default or to impose one of the alternative sanctions, the effect of the amendments will be to establish precisely how and when the alternative sanctions will operate.  As Deputy Flanagan will know from his practice, the issue of following fines and civil debt is fairly tortuous in our courts.  These amendments insert the ability of the court, in fining a person, to make a recovery order and various elements will kick into place immediately thereafter.  A person can pay by instalments before that and if there is a default on those, the recovery order kicks in.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The recovery order necessitates somebody being appointed by the court, such as a sheriff, to take goods to the value of the fine.  These goods fulfil the court order but if the agent does not get such goods, certain other provisions kick in with these amendments, including the obligation for community service.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The amendments in this group are a mix of substantive changes and consequential drafting changes.  Section 10, setting out the period of imprisonment the courts can impose for default, and section 16, relating to the recovery order, are being deleted and their substance in amended format is being incorporated into other sections.  I am also deleting the first two subsections of section 15 and replacing them with important amendments establishing the role of the courts in imposing fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">In future, when a court imposes a fine for a criminal offence, it will also appoint a receiver to recover the fine or to seize and sell property from the offender to the value of the fine.  The recovery order will only enter into force if the offender defaults on the payment of the fine and it will have effect from the time the Courts Service notifies the receiver of the default.  This means the only option open to the court where a person does not pay a fine by the due date is to order the recovery of the fine and its value in property by the receiver.  It is a logical first step on default to recover the fine and its value before considering other options that would result in additional cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The system outlined will not require any additional court sittings as the recovery order is made at the time the fine is imposed and automatically enters into force on default.  The reason the order will not take effect until the receiver is notified of the default by the Courts Service is to give the person in default one final opportunity to pay.  The duties and responsibilities of receivers are set out in section 15 and an amendment I am making to the section is to permit a receiver to be appointed by one or more members of the Garda Síochána when carrying out his or her duties, as authorised in the court order.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">What happens if the receiver is unable to recover the fine or any property belonging to the offender, as this will probably happen in a few cases?  Most persons fined by the court will live in accommodation and possess goods such as televisions and so on.  Approximately three quarters of fines imposed in District Courts are for road traffic offences so it is probably safe to assume the vast majority of persons so fined own cars.  There will nonetheless be cases where the receiver will report to the court an inability to recover the fine or its value in property.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">In such cases the Courts Service will have informed the probation service of the receiver's failure to recover the fine and the probation service will prepare a report for submission to the court on whether the offender is suitable for community service and if a place is available.  Most but not all persons are suitable for community service and the probation service will try to tailor a work programme to suit the problems and needs which some offenders might have.  The probation service has the capacity to manage and supervise additional supervisory community service orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">If the offender consents and is suitable for community service and a place is available, a community service order will be imposed.  Only if the offender does not consent and other conditions are not met does the question of imprisonment arise.  The amendments to section 18 give effect to the changes to the community services aspects of the scheme in this group of amendments.  Currently, the minimum number of hours of community service that can be imposed by a court is 40 hours and there is a maximum of 240 hours.  This will also be the case where a person defaults on payment of a fine imposed on conviction on indictment.  On summary conviction, where the fines are generally modest — with an average fine of approximately €300 — the minimum number of hours will be 30 hours and the maximum 100 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Section 18 sets out the maximum terms of imprisonment for failure to pay on time a fine imposed on conviction on indictment.  I am replacing this with provisions taking the place of it and section 10, which I have already indicated is being repealed.  The amount of any fine or value of the property recovered, if any, will be taken into account in calculating the number of days imprisonment to be served on default.  Failure to comply with the requirements of the community service order will also result in imprisonment in accordance with the scales set out in the section.  There would be little point in imposing a fine for failure to carry out a community service order when the community service order was imposed in the first place for failure to pay a fine on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Section 20 sets out the procedure for the appointment of receivers.  Such a person or persons will be nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the consent of the Minister for Finance and approved by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I have spoken at length on this grouping of amendments but they represent a genuine and important policy change with regard to fining defaulters.  The traditional policy of imprisonment is no longer viable or socially desirable.  It also places a significant financial burden on the State and uses prison places that should be available for serious criminals.  The proposals in my amendments will result in fewer offenders failing to pay fines as who would want a receiver knocking on the door, in front of neighbours, and removing property?</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Where default occurs I propose a cost-effective way of recovering for the State the fine or its value in property.  If that does not work — in such cases there would be very few defaulters — the probation service has the capacity to manage additional community service orders without any increase in allocation.  Underlying my proposals is determination to keep the need for additional court sittings to a minimum so at a relatively low cost the Exchequer will gain substantially and prison will only be a real option in a tiny number of cases.  I very much recommend these important amendments to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">As I mentioned we have spent much time considering the issue to ensure a position where people fined in court for offences make recompense in a cost-effective way.  I am conscious of the position of people who are not habitual offenders and who are fined.  For some reason such people may not pay the fine and in a couple of months a local garda would look to take them to Mountjoy.  If this happens such people must go through a fairly significant bureaucracy and great difficulty is created in the prison because space must be found and so on.  The family of the this person may pay the fine shortly afterwards and he or she is then released.  This involves much bureaucracy and wastes Garda and prison time as well as prison space.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">We are looking to save time for the Garda and the Prison Service.  Quite properly, the overriding view of me and my Department is that in this day and age, people who are not habitual offenders should not be put in prison.  It is unfair on such people as although they may have committed an offence, it might be the only offence they will ever commit.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Deputy Flanagan knows that a judge may impose a €1,000 fine and seven days in default but this will now be a €1,000 fine and a recovery order, which will dictate provisions on default of instalment payments or the full fine by a due date.  The receiver will go to the premises in question and look for the person, demanding goods to the value of the fine.  The receiver will have the power to sell, if necessary.  A total of 75% of the fines in the District Court are for road traffic offences, so if the person who has offended owns a car then that could be taken in lieu of the fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">If the receiver comes back without the value of the goods, then we propose that the person be examined for the possibility of carrying out a community service order.  The person will have to consent and will have to be suitable before carrying out the community service order hours.  We already have had detailed discussions with the Probation Service about its capacity, and its officials have assured me that they are able even to quadruple the number of hours to be taken on.  This is because when offenders are doing community service, they usually only do it one at a time, so the Probation Service can easily double up.  Anybody who is interested in this should look at the last annual report of the Probation Service and the section that deals with community service orders.  It shows that individual community groups around the country have benefitted from community service orders.  I am talking here about things like graffiti removal, working with tidy towns groups and so on.  Local community groups will be able to avail of extra help from the ramping up of the community service position.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">We looked at other possibilities before putting people into prison, for example creating a threshold under which somebody would not go to prison at all.  However, we found that people who were fined under the threshold could thumb their nose at the system and get away without paying, as there was no other reasonable way to enforce the fine.  If people were cute, they would not consent to a community service order, would not pay by instalments and make it difficult for the receiver to take any goods, all of which would mean they would get away with it.  In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and with my own Department, it was decided that we would not create that threshold for no imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The options move along from fine, instalments, receiver, community service order and then imprisonment.  Amendment No. 79 allows the Courts Service to publish a list of names of persons who fail to pay fines on time.  That is an added incentive for people to pay their fines, as it effectively names and shames those who refuse to pay.  Some people will be aghast at the possibility that their names will appear for not paying fines, while others will not care if their names appear.  Ultimately, we still have to keep imprisonment as the final option, but the Bill is designed to ensure that as few people as possible are imprisoned for defaulting on fines.  Therefore, I strongly recommend these amendments to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_577">I welcome what the Minister has said and I welcome what he has done in addressing the heart of the Bill.  We must strike a balance between those who are unable, for one reason or another, to discharge the fine and those who are unwilling to pay and respond to the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I accept the Minister's point that there are often difficulties.  For example, it often appears that higher fines are imposed in court on persons who do not attend for whatever reason.  They may have lost the summons or do not regard it as being as serious as it should be, or maybe they have received some bad advice that there is no need to attend.  They are often then faced with a higher fine because the court wishes to register the lack of respect on the part of the person for his or her inability to attend.  This gives rise to problems because the court has no idea as to the financial status or the dependent, family or employment circumstances of the individual involved.  This can cause hardship down the line where the person who is unable to pay the fine does not have a choice, and when the garda comes knocking on the door a few months later to execute a warrant for imprisonment, that garda is unable to accept an amount less than the full payment of the fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">We referred to this problem on Committee Stage and we pointed out that there was an element of redress some years ago in the from of a ministerial petition, which regrettably received some very bad press and was discontinued.  There are circumstances in which I would still see merit in such an arrangement, albeit narrowly focused at the level of ministerial discretion.  However, what we are doing now will assist in some way.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">When the fine is imposed, my understanding is that instead of having the rider of seven days' imprisonment in default of payment within the period, the reference will be made to the new receiver.  How will it come back on the court list?  I presume there will be a return date where unpaid or undischarged fines will be listed for hearing.  It will not be at the application of the person against whom the fine is levied, because that person may not know about it or may not have expressed an interest.  There will be a duty on the State to have the matter listed for hearing at some later date to allow for the receiver process to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The ultimate sanction of imprisonment for people who will not pay is probably unavoidable because otherwise the system will not work without the deterrent of the ultimate sanction of loss of liberty.  However, the fact that almost 4,000 citizens were imprisoned last year for defaulting on fines underlines the need to bring about change, having regard to the fact that it costs almost €100,000 to keep somebody in prison.  If up to 4,000 people are being imprisoned for a period either in respect of the non-payment of fines or as a result of an inability on the part of the State to collect fines, there is no doubt but that a cost arises.  In such circumstances, there are no winners.  In the first instance, the State does not obtain its money.  In the second, it finds it difficult to recover any funds because those who are in prison cannot pursue any lawful occupations that would facilitate their making earnings which would thereby allow them to pay their fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I agree with the Minister in respect of the community service option.  I am somewhat concerned that the courts do not appear to be invoking this option in the manner in which they might do so.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why the figures relating to community service orders appear to be declining.  The value for money and policy review of the community service scheme indicates that 2,500 community service orders were issued by the District Court in 2007, whereas in 2003 the figure was 2,883.  I am concerned with regard to the decline in these figures.  I do not have the 2009 figures in my possession.  If the Minister has sight of them, perhaps he could inform the House of the position.  I would have thought that community service orders were working well, particularly in light of the recent report of the probation and welfare service.  It is regrettable that community service is not being used to the same extent as in the past.  I understand it is only being used in respect of a proportion of offences and a percentage of the offenders to whom it is applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">There are a number of other issues relating to these amendments which I raised on Committee Stage.  If the Minister is not in a position to provide information in respect of those issues at this point, perhaps he might forward me a note in respect of them.  In that context, I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House in any way.  I welcome what the Minister is doing here because it is extremely important.  The legislation was lacking in the absence of the measures he is introducing in these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Will the Minister outline the reason for mandatory fines?  I refer, in particular, to revenue and customs offences in respect of which there is just one level of fine and this is somewhat on the high side.  There is no scale provided but the sitting judge will have power to commute.  More often than not, the latter is done immediately.  However, it need not necessarily be done.  The vast majority of fines handed down in the courts relate to road traffic offences.  However, a scale applies in respect of such fines and this is often linked to the ability of a defendant — should he or she be present to explain the circumstances relating to the case to the presiding judge — to pay.  Most revenue and weights and measures offences appear to be mandatory in nature.  Why is that the case?  What is the State's reasoning in respect of the imposition of such mandatory fines?</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I am also concerned with regard to the compulsory assessment of means.  What mechanism can be applied in respect of such an assessment?  Bearing in mind that a defendant may not appear in court, would a matter be adjourned and an onus placed on the court clerk to serve further documentation on said defendant and produce registered post slips to show that every effort was made to contact him or her before any inordinate fine is imposed?</p>
          <p eId="para_586">We dealt with the payment of fines by instalment.  I refer here to the right or ability of an aggrieved individual to make an application to the court that a fine be paid by way of instalment.  I presume that in such cases it will be necessary to engage in an assessment of means.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome the amendments.  If other issues arise, I am sure the Minister and our colleagues in the Seanad can deal with them at the appropriate time.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">I will not delay proceedings except to say that I agree with the tenor and tone of the amendments tabled by the Minister.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to ensure that people who are not criminals but who transgress or make mistakes will not be imprisoned as a result of not paying fines.  The legislation is also designed to put in place a process to ensure that people will have every avenue open to them in order that they might pay fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to people's financial circumstances?  Do I understand that there is some degree of sympathy for persons who may have transgressed and who might find themselves subject to fines?  Will the new process take into account an individual's inability to pay in the context of both their outgoings and their overall earnings?  The Minister referred, in some sympathy, to persons who may have unintentionally transgressed and indicated that, for obvious reasons, he wants to keep them out of prison.  Is it the case that an appointed receiver will be in a position to recover property from someone who does not pay a fine?</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The amendments before the House improve the legislation.  The bottom line is that citizens must be given every means and opportunity possible to pay fines and avoid prison.  In addition, the legislation must contain a mechanism which ensures that no one will take advantage of any perceived softening in the approach of putting in place a system of fines in the first instance.  I welcome the amendments.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_601">Our current model of mental health care is largely institution-based, and 15 Victorian and older asylums are still in use.  However, A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high-quality mental health service over a seven to ten year period and recommends that the remaining psychiatric hospitals should close and that patients should be relocated to more appropriate community-based settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The mental health capital programme will provide the infrastructure necessary for the patient-centred, flexible community-based service envisioned in A Vision for Change and will facilitate closure of the remaining hospitals.  In this regard, budget 2010 provided for a multi-annual programme of capital investment to be funded from the proceeds of the sale of lands.  In 2010, the HSE will dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €50 million in developing the new mental health infrastructure.  Projects which will be progressed in 2010 include the development of an acute unit at Beaumont to replace the acute unit at St. Ita's, Portrane; the construction of a community nursing unit in Clonmel which will enable St. Luke's Hospital to close later this year; and the construction of a community nursing unit in Mullingar to facilitate the closure of St. Loman's Hospital.  Approximately 300 patients with an intellectual disability are placed in psychiatric hospitals.  Their needs, which relate to their disability rather than a mental health concern, will be addressed by the HSE in the context of the closure of the hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">In addition to those inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals, it is estimated that approximately 4,000 people with disabilities reside in institutions or congregated settings.  This includes a cohort of approximately 460 patients with an intellectual disability who are accommodated in specialised units which were formerly designated as psychiatric hospitals.  Their needs will be addressed in the context of the review of congregated settings which is nearing completion.  Congregated settings are defined as living arrangements where ten or more people share a single living unit or where the living arrangements are campus-based.  The review will inform policy development on services for people with disabilities and specify a framework to guide the transfer of identified individuals from congregated settings to the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">In 2004, planning permission was sought and granted for a new psychiatric unit at Beaumont and, as far as I know, it was put out to tender in 2005.  However, nothing happened thereafter, funding having been withdrawn or evaporated.  The new collocated private hospital at Beaumont, which has yet to have a sod turned, a brick put in place or a bed delivered, is impinging on that site and the psychiatric unit must move elsewhere.  Today, we are told again by the Minister of State that it is in the pipeline.  We have been waiting for 20 or 25 years and it is just not good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">Why do children continue to be admitted to adult centres?  In 2009, 155 children were admitted to adult centres.  Suicide rates have increased and 1,200 seriously ill patients continue to be admitted to inappropriate institutions.  Will the Minister of State provide a list of assets sold to date and the revenue raised for same; a list of assets due to be sold and the estimated revenue that will be raised for same; the timescale for investment; and the details of where the 1,200 patients will be placed?  With regard to those with intellectual disabilities, our mental health services were described by the inspector as crumbling institutions unfit for human habitation with residents wandering around aimlessly, cramped dormitories, the presence of dirt, the stench of urine, poor sanitation, broken furniture and the absence of constructive daily activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">In 2010, the HSE will dispose of surplus assets and reinvest the initial sum of €50 million.  The HSE has already identified properties and has already received €15 million.  It is in the process of selling other lands which will realise €50 million this year.  The mental health capital programme will provide a range of facilities throughout the entire spectrum of mental health care facilities, including acute psychiatric units, day hospitals, community nursing units and high-support hostels, which will provide the infrastructure necessary to enable its modernisation into a patient-centred flexible community-based mental health service.  The acute unit at Beaumont is prioritised as one of the projects to be funded in 2010.  Acute admissions will be moved from St. Ita's to a new unit at Beaumont.</p>

Deputy Reilly was present when the Minister of State indicated that he is working with the Minister for Finance to develop a mechanism whereby the human resources in certain mental health services can be supported and reconfigured where vacancies arise elsewhere and in the overall employment control framework of the HSE.</p>

          her views on a report issued by the Department of the Taoiseach under the auspices of the organisational review programme (details supplied); her plans to review and refocus the work of her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_440">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_619">At the request of the Department of Health and Children, a review of the Department was carried out last year under the organisational review programme, ORP.  The report of this review was received approximately four weeks ago and the Department is now preparing an action plan which will set out its response to the ORP conclusions.  The report and action plan will be published in due course along with similar reports and action plans for other Government offices and Departments, following submission to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">The ORP is a public service modernisation initiative under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  It involves assessing the capacity of individual Departments and major Government offices to meet their challenges over the coming years.  It is essentially a management tool which can be used by Departments to help them improve their performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">While it would be inappropriate to comment on the report in advance of its consideration by Government and publication, the Department has already made it clear that it welcomes this report and is satisfied that it provides a timely and helpful review.  The report acknowledges the Department's strengths and achievements including, in particular, the ability and commitment of its staff in dealing with a difficult agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">It also identifies areas which require improvement, including the need to clarify its roles and responsibilities particularly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the HSE; manage delivery by its agencies through stronger goal setting, output and outcome measurement and performance management; define its customers and stakeholders more clearly and align itself to serving these appropriately; and improve its human resource capacities.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">I am confident the Department will respond effectively to the ORP report and will use it as intended, to build on its undoubted strengths and to further improve its performance in these changing and challenging times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_624">I note the Minister stated she cannot comment because it has not been published.  Is the account published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Thursday, 18 February accurate?  It depicts a lamentable account of mismanagement and disorganisation in the Department, which indicates that some people have too much to do and other people do not have anything to do.  It suggests that there should be more of a focus on the main stakeholder, namely, the patient.  Will the Minister comment on that?  Why has it taken so long to reorganise the Department given that the Health Service Executive has been in existence for five years?  Presumably that should have been enough time to reorganise the Department.  Given that the functions, in essence, have been passed on to the Health Service Executive, does the Minister consider that 436 core staff are required in the Department?  Why do staff spend so much time on Oireachtas business especially as most of our questions are passed on to the Health Service Executive?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_442" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_625">The number of staff in the Department has reduced by 25% since the Health Service Executive was established.  The Department was never an operational Department.  In the health board era it was never involved in operational issues.  A myth has arisen in this regard.  The Accounting Officer role has changed.  The chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive who spends the money is accountable to the Oireachtas for the expenditure of that money.  That is an appropriate management tool and although it has been criticised in some quarters it has been very much praised in another.  It is not acceptable that a Secretary General of a Department who is not responsible for the expenditure of money and operational issues should have remained the Accounting Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The huge change in the Department was acknowledged in the report.  Unfortunately, the report was leaked.  I say that because the staff in the Department were entitled to hear from management on the outcome of the report before they read it in a newspaper but someone chose to leak the report and we have to deal with that.  The role of the Department has changed immensely.  For example, until recently the medical team in the Department led by the chief medical officer had an advisory role; now the chief medical officer heads up a division of the Department and has management responsibility for patient safety.  That is the division dealing, for example, with the upcoming licensing and accreditation of health facilities.  The role has changed enormously.  The report is full of praise for the Department in many respects, including the cancer policy, the cardiovascular strategy and the fair deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">Deputy O'Sullivan inquired whether there are too many staff.  Most Oireachtas Members who have an interest in this area were exposed to the team of three people who were involved not just in putting together the fair deal legislation but in discussing it with all stakeholders and other Departments.  We are usually accused of not being accountable to the Oireachtas but we are one of the most productive Departments in terms of producing legislation.  Last year four major Bills were produced and 12 Bills are in preparation.  The Department deals with more than 5,000 parliamentary questions and 500 Adjournment debates.  It is an extremely busy Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The head of the Department in this case is the Minister and the Ministers of State.  The management team is led by the Secretary General.  We are fortunate to have one of the most dynamic public servants of his generation.  It is a matter for him and his management team to address the issue if it is the case that some people do not have enough to do and others at the lower levels have too much to do.  That is not an acceptable position from management's perspective and the Secretary General and his team intend to deal with that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_629">I acknowledge the work of the staff who are dealing with a fair deal.  They have been particularly helpful in that regard.  I do not wish there to be any doubt on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">What we read in the newspaper indicated much chaos with some people having too much to do and others having nothing to do.  Has the Minister commenced the reorganisation of the Department since that report was received?</p>
            <p eId="para_631">I question whether many of the decisions being made by the Health Service Executive are implementation or policy decisions in so far as in times of budgetary constraints, deciding where the budget goes can in effect be a policy decision.  What input does the Minister have on bed closures and on the various other decisions that impact on patients that are currently made by the Health Service Executive?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_444" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_632">Traditionally, the Department over-concentrated on inputs.  As is clear from the report, the role of the Department is focused on outcomes, results and measuring performance.  The report draws attention to the need for the Department to have a different skill-set such as economic analysis and analytical skills in general.  I share that view.  The service plan has to be approved by the Minister.  I agree that there is a fine line in many respects between policy and its implementation.  The cancer control framework was a policy initiative of mine which was endorsed by the Government and implemented by the Health Service Executive.  The Department has to be praised for that policy initiative.  We need to see the Department involved in more of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">Significant reorganisation has taken place.  It is acknowledged that the Department and the Health Service Executive are on a journey in terms of how services are provided.  Initially there is always a lot of nervousness about change but the working relationship between the Department and the Health Service Executive has improved immensely.  I want to see that continue.  I would be happy to arrange for Deputies to meet and engage with the management team.  Members would see that they are made up of hard-working, committed, energetic civil servants who take that task seriously.</p>

          the number of acute hospital beds closed nationally; the reason those beds are closed; the details of her plans to close an additional 1,100 hospital beds in 2010; the location of those beds; her views on the impact that will have on patient services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_635">The most recent information on bed closures in the acute hospital system refers to the week ended 17 January 2010.  At that time, 689 inpatient beds and 37 day beds were closed for reasons of cost-containment, infection control, refurbishment and seasonal closure of facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">While public debate tends to focus on bed numbers, it is much more meaningful to measure the number of patients treated.  In 2009, the combined number of inpatient and day case discharges was 3% greater than the equivalent figure in 2008, despite the difficult situation in regard to resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">The preparation of the Health Service Executive's 2010 national service plan, which I approved on 5 February, maintains the focus on increased efficiency and targets broadly the same level of overall hospital activity as in 2009.  This involves a shift from inpatient to day cases, a reduction in emergency admissions and a further increase in day cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">While there is no proposal in the service plan to close a specific number of beds, the reduction in inpatient treatments will mean that less capacity will be required in this area during 2010.  The exact number of beds available at any one time will fluctuate depending on such factors as planned activity levels, maintenance and refurbishment requirements and staff leave arrangements.  Beds may be also closed from time to time to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allocated budget for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Meeting the agreed efficiency targets will require increased access to the specialist skills and senior clinical decision-making available in medical assessment units, to diagnostics and to other ambulatory care services.  The HSE will also focus on minimising length of stay, with a particular focus on reducing the current variation across different hospitals for similar procedures.  It will also work to increase same day of surgery admission and to protect inpatient beds for elective surgery to reduce waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">By reforming the manner in which services are provided, I am confident the HSE can deliver the volumes of service provided for in the plan, while at the same time continuing to improve service quality and patient outcomes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_446">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_641">Despite what Professor Drumm has to say, I fail to see how one can possibly reduce emergency admissions by 33,000.  I have spoken to accident and emergency consultants the length and breadth of this country and they are not admitting any patients that are not emergencies and that in medical terms need admission.  In Galway, one of the dedicated centres for cancer care, they have reached a record level of an average of 18 patients overnighting on trolleys every single night this year to the end of February.  Yesterday, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, 368 people were lying on trolleys.  We learnt of a man who died in an accident and emergency department having waited there for seven hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">A reduction of 54,000 inpatient procedures will be compensated for by an increase of 10,000 outpatient procedures.  The maths does not add up.  Professor Drumm has confirmed that 1,100 more beds will be closed.  How is the Minister going to achieve that?  Will she give us a breakdown of where the beds will be closed and what hospitals will be affected?</p>

            <p eId="para_643">I wish to explain something to the Deputy because it makes a difference.  Many procedures can be done on a day case basis that are currently done on an inpatient basis.  I will outline some data.  For example, 37% of hernia repairs happen on a day case basis.  It varies from Tallaght where 84% of them happen on a day case basis to Mayo where only 16% happen on a day case basis.  The length of stay in Mayo is on average three days.  In the case of varicose vein procedures, 56% are done on a day case basis, varying from 99% at St. Columcille's Hospital,  Loughlinstown, County Dublin, to 57% at Mercy Hospital, Cork.  For cataracts, the day case rate varies from 90% in the Mater, Waterford, Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals to 42% in St. Vincent's Hospital.  In the case of hip replacements, it goes from seven days in Croom to 18 days in Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">If all facilities could operate to the level of best practice within the country, that in itself would have enormous potential to decrease dependence on inpatient activity.  Dr. Barry White has been appointed clinical affairs director of the Health Service Executive and is now appointing clinical leads, particularly in area of chronic illness, to devise and work with clinicians on care pathways.  For example, as part of that process, the intention is to ring-fence surgical beds for surgeons so that they are not obliged to have patients admitted one or two days in advance in order to ensure a bed is available.  These reforms will generate much increased activity in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">With all due respect, it is necessary to observe that the Minister has been in office for four years and the Health Service Executive in existence longer.  The purpose of the reorganisation of the management of health services was to bring about a uniformity in the delivery of care.  We can only look to the Minister herself in assessing the failure to address the issue she has just raised, namely, the lack of uniformity of approach, where particular procedures can be done on an outpatient basis in some hospitals but require inpatient admittance in others.  No attempt has been made to resolve this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The Minister has not answered the core question, which is a simple arithmetic question.  How does one tally a reduction in inpatient procedures of 50,000 with an increase of 10,000 in outpatient procedures?  Will the Minister explain how the apparent net deficit of 40,000 will be overcome and how it will not result in longer waiting times and increased pain and worry for patients?</p>

            <p eId="para_647">The Deputy, if he is being fair, must acknowledge the substantial progress that has been made in the delivery of health services, particularly in regard to day case activity which has virtually doubled since 2000.  In regard to the service plan, the main element of the change is that 33,000 fewer people will be admitted to hospital in the first place.  Those people will either receive hospital-in-the-home services or be provided with diagnostic access without requiring hospital admission.  As Professor Drumm has pointed out, a large proportion of those who go into hospital are there for less than 48 hours; in some cases it is less than 24 hours.  It is well established that many of these people do not need to be hospitalised but are admitted in order to access diagnostics and so on.  Those types of services will be provided in an alternative way.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_653">The Health Service Executive received notice on 22 February from the trade union IMPACT of its intention to intensify its members' industrial action with effect from Monday, 1 March.  The HSE was informed that, in addition to their existing actions, IMPACT members would refuse to take on work in regard to any vacancy, not just those vacancies that have arisen since the general industrial action commenced on 25 January 2010; refuse to participate in all work relating to the HSE's reconfiguration programme; refuse to deal with all political representations, including parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests; and refuse to answer telephones, including mobile telephones, for specified periods of time, to be advised by the union, with little advance notice to management.  This will apply unless a specific derogation for emergency cover has been agreed with the union.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Clearly, health service employers are very concerned about the potential impact of this intensification of the industrial action on services and patient safety.  I share this concern.  I assure the Deputy that the situation is being monitored on a daily basis by the HSE and my Department.  It is a matter of great regret to me to see patients and the public inconvenienced in this way.  There is no doubt that following a period of rapid increases in funding, health services are now facing the challenge of managing within much tighter resource constraints.  There is scope within our health system, by reforming how services are delivered, to achieve more through greater efficiency and concentrating on services that contribute most to people's health and well-being.  There is an onus on all concerned — Government, management, trade unions and employees — to find a way of engaging in the reforms that are needed to deliver better services to patients.</p>

The information provided by the Minister at the start of her reply was given to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, who kindly responded to my matter on the Adjournment last Thursday.  Has the Minister had any reports on the effects of the action in the health service?  Has she met with representatives of any union besides IMPACT?  SIPTU, for example, also has a large number of workers in the health service.  Has the Minister been informed of any ongoing actions and what information does she have from her meeting with IMPACT as to what is likely to happen in the coming weeks?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_656">To clarify, I have not met with any of the unions.  The industrial relations activity that is under way is part of a broader campaign across the public sector the response to which is being led and managed by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  To clarify another point, the Government did not pull out of talks with the unions.  Unfortunately, we failed to reach agreement within those talks, and I am eager to see them resume as quickly as possible.  In every dispute between Government and its employees or the employees of others, it is incumbent upon us to find a resolution.  From the perspective of the health service, and patient safety in particular, I would like to see a resumption of the talks as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">In areas where it was anticipated that there could be a negative impact on patient safety, where management has engaged at local level with the relevant unions that threat has not materialised.  Radiotherapy services in Cork are an example of that.  To the best of my knowledge I do not have information that would suggest there have been any adverse effects on any patient services, except that there is a difficulty in giving information to those who require it, including Members of the Oireachtas.  It is difficult to operate and manage an organisation as large as the health service without appropriate information on a daily and weekly basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">Yes, but I must be able to access the information in order to respond accurately to Members.  Neither I nor my colleagues have all the information in our heads.  In recent weeks, and in preparation for today in particular, we pulled out all the stops to obtain information.  In the current unusual situation even very senior people are involved in the industrial action.  In order to provide up-to-date information to the Oireachtas, data must be obtained on a real-time basis.  It was not possible to do that in the case of many of the questions we are discussing today, but we have done our best.  What we are experiencing is not different from what is happening in other Departments.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_661">I am informed by the Health Service Executive that it expects to publish the report of the independent inquiry into the Roscommon abuse case in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The report into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald, published in 1995, contained in excess of 40 recommendations.  Those recommendations were presented to the then Western Health Board and adopted in full by it.  Several of the report's recommendations required consideration at national level, including: the need for amendment of  the Constitution to include a statement of the constitutional rights of children; the need for the establishment at a national level of a system for the setting and monitoring of child protection standards to promote examples of good practice and to inquire into serious failures of practice; and the need to introduce a system of mandatory reporting.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">Issues relevant to the rights of the child have been considered by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children which recently published its third and final report.  That report will now be considered by Government.  Issues relating to national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children and the conduct of reviews into serious incidents are addressed in the Government's implementation plan in response to the recommendation of the Ryan commission.  The issue of mandatory reporting was previously considered.  International evidence suggests that mandatory reporting can overload existing child protection systems with high volumes of reports, often resulting in no commensurate increase in substantiated cases.  The concern, therefore, is that child protection resources would be diverted into an extensive administrative system with no guarantee of increased protection for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">A number of the additional recommendations in the report highlighted the need for significantly improved and standardised business processes to ensure consistency in service delivery.  In this regard the HSE recently has completed a national project designed to standardise the child welfare and protection business processes across all regions.  The process of implementation is now being commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The report into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_666">we do not believe it is possible to guarantee that children will not be abused but we believe that Health Boards, as child protection agencies, must aim to ensure that all children at risk are accurately identified and that intervention is effective in reducing the level of risk to a child or removing it altogether.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">This remains a principal focus of the Government and its agencies as it seeks to strengthen the existing child welfare and protection system.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_668">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  As he is aware, the first part of the question relates to the barbaric abuse, both physical and sexual, perpetrated on children in County Roscommon, which resulted in the mother of children being convicted in the courts in January 2009.  The father involved was convicted only recently and sentencing is due on Friday.  Originally, it was promised that the report into the Roscommon tragedy would be published in July.  My understanding is that its publication has been delayed for understandable reasons pending completion of the criminal prosecution.  When the Minister of State stated the report will be published in a matter of weeks, what precisely is meant by that?  Does he know whether the report essentially is complete?  Does it merely await publication following sentencing, which is expected this Friday?  Are there other issues the Minister of State anticipates will arise with regard to the publication of the report?  It is clear, based on what already is known, that this report will depict yet another appalling failure by the Western Health Board in respect of this family to provide children with the protection to which they are entitled.  I note it is the same health board that was criticised in the Kelly Fitzgerald report.  Is it known whether the report in full will be published?  Does the Minister of State know whether the report, as prepared, includes an audit of the extent to which, in the years that followed the publication of the Kelly Fitzgerald report, the Western Health Board failed to implement the recommendations contained therein?  Will publication of the report require prior permission from either the mother or the father of the children who were the victims of abuse in Roscommon?</p>

            <p eId="para_669">I understand the report is substantially complete and that the issue of publication is related to the criminal prosecution and the sentencing which, as the Deputy observed, is due next Friday.  Obviously, I have not seen it and cannot comment on what issues might arise in respect of publication.  However, I assure the House that the inquiry is being chaired by a person in whom everyone in this House who is familiar with children's rights issues will have great confidence, namely, Norah Gibbons, and I have no doubt but that every effort will be made to ensure that the report is published.  Members will be aware that it frequently arises that one must balance the rights of individuals to their good name and to privacy for families in particular, against the great public interest in knowing how such tragedies came to pass and to learn from them accordingly.  As for publication, the inquiry will be published through the HSE, which will give all due consideration to the manner of its publication thereafter.</p>

In addition, will the Minister of State confirm that it is unacceptable to suggest that parents who have substantially failed their children or who have abused their children physically or sexually should be entitled to a veto on the publication of reports in the public interest to ensure the existence of a proper functioning child care system?  Does the Minister of State agree it is a false analogy to suggest that some form of confidentiality would entitle parents who have failed their own children to exercise a veto over the full publication of reports into the failure of our social services to provide children with the protection to which they are entitled?</p>

Is the Minister of State seriously suggesting, in the context of the issue he now has raised, that it was in the best interests of children generally in this State or in the interests of a functioning child care and protection service, that an eight-year old report should languish unpublished in his Department and on the shelves of the HSE for 12 months?  It was a damning indictment of the complete failure of our child care services to provide for the protection of a child.  Does the Minister of State seriously suggest that a mother who failed that child and who was reported in that report to have physically assaulted the child at the age of seven to the extent that two of the child's front teeth were removed, is entitled to exercise a veto in the public interest over the publication of that report?  I will conclude by suggesting to the Minister of State that the public interest is that there should be transparency and accountability in our child care services to the maximum extent to ensure they truly protect children.</p>

One key element in the restoration of public trust in that part of our health service is to ensure that reports like these are published.  To suggest, as has been suggested on the floor of this Chamber today, that there is a mentality of cover-up or a failure to try to effect transparency, is most inaccurate and unfair to people who work extremely hard in the interests of children.  I will continue to try to effect the changes the Government announced following the Ryan report and the implementation plan arising from it.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_489" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_698">There is increasing recognition that health outcomes are influenced by income, housing, educational attainment and other factors that fall outside the remit of the health sector.  Within that sector, there is also a need to develop policies and services that address the particular needs of specific groups, such as Travellers, homeless adults, drug users and prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">My Department participates in the senior officials group on social inclusion, which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and aims to improve the position of lower socio-economic groups and others at risk of social exclusion.  It also works with the HSE and other agencies to provide more effective health services to marginalised groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">By way of example, my Department established the Traveller Health Advisory Committee and has commissioned the all-Ireland Traveller health study, which we will have to hand later this year.  It has also contributed to the development of the homelessness strategy published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2008 as well as working with the HSE to improve the provision of health services to homeless adults.  It works closely with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the implementation of the national drugs strategy and with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of forensic mental health services.  It has also developed a policy on service users' involvement, with a particular focus on marginalised groups.  It works with the HSE to ensure this is fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">The Department maintains a close working relationship with the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, IPH, which has a specific remit in respect of health inequality.  The Department has just nominated the institute to be its representative on a three-year EU joint action programme on health inequality.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">Reducing the effect of poverty on health outcomes is a common challenge for health systems around the world.  My Department is committed to working with other stakeholders to tackle and reduce health inequality.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_490">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_703">While we discuss the ins and outs of the health services, the greatest factor in whether a person will be healthy is the area and the type of family into which he or she is born.  We do not spend enough time addressing the relationship between health and poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">I take the point that the Minister's Department is involved with other Departments and so on, but how does she get the other Departments to prioritise issues that affect people's health?  I attended the launch of a document published by the Galway Travellers Movement regarding a particular halting site in Galway.  The movement assessed the effect of the site's conditions on the health of those living there.  In this context, to what extent can the Minister for Health and Children influence, for example, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address these issues?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_491" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_705">At Cabinet level, it is co-ordinated by what is broadly called the social inclusion sub-committee.  The officials group, which involves several Departments, works on the social inclusion agenda, including health.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">Regarding Travellers specifically, I recently attended a similar launch in my constituency.  In recent years, we have funded a number of primary care workers for the Traveller community, where they are having a significant impact on health issues.  We do not have the results of the recent census to hand, but it will provide us with a considerable amount of information, not only on the health status of the Traveller community, but on relevant matters.  I hope to have the report quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Our involvement with the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been concerned with the drug strategy.  The HSE provides many services that are sometimes policy priorities for other Departments, including direct health services to homeless people.  As the Deputy stated, the health needs of the most disadvantaged will not simply be dealt with by the health Ministry.  Housing, sanitation, education and the child immunisation programme have important roles to play in health outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_711">Will the Minister assure the House that the funding put in place to address the issue of Traveller health will be used for that purpose?  Previously, money had been siphoned off into other areas.  As alluded to by my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the HSE has a hold on policy in that when money is not spent in a policy directive area, it can use it elsewhere.  There are ways and means to not spend money.  We have seen it not only in this case, but in terms of palliative care and mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">Given that income plays a large role in health outcomes, does the Minister intend to change the income threshold for the medical card, which currently stands at a little more than half the minimum wage?  Anyone who is prepared to work full-time is not entitled to a medical card.  Sometimes, part-time workers are not entitled to it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_496" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_713">In the current circumstances, the answer to the last question is "No".  The reality of the economic situation in which we find ourselves is that an additional 200,000 people have recently acquired medical cards.  If memory serves me correctly, as I do not have the data in my brief, 1.48 million people are covered by full medical cards and 98,000 have doctor-only cards.  These figures constitute a large portion of the population.  The cost of providing services to our medical card community is substantially higher than it is, for example, across the Border.  This influences the amount of cover we can provide in any one year.  To be realistic, in the current financial circumstances, I do not anticipate changing the threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">The resource allocation group, which will report later this year, is examining all of the issues in respect of how to allocate health resources to get better outcomes for patients.  Where Travellers are concerned, we have provided a great deal of additional money.  We have also provided an extra €33 million for health projects for the homeless community.  A priority of mine is that we continue with investments in these areas, where the most marginalised have bad health outcomes.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_715">What specific actions has the Minister and her Department taken on the back of the report published last October by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, entitled, "Well-Being Matters: A Social Report for Ireland", which found that we were joint seventh last on the list of the 27 EU member states in terms of access to hospital services?  In that report, some 76% of EU citizens recorded ease of access to hospital services, yet only 65% of citizens in this State recorded ease of access.  It was clear that the 35% who did not respond were from the least well-off in our community.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The IPH and the Combat Poverty Agency's 2008 report recommended that greater health equity and reductions in health inequality needs to become Government policy and be fast-tracked as priorities.  It called for a health impact assessment to be done in respect of key Government policy.  What has the Minister done on the back of this report, which is working towards being two years <i>in situ</i>?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_717">I am not certain that proofing every policy would deliver the types of result the Deputy anticipates.  Currently, every memorandum that goes to the Government must be gender proofed, poverty proofed, competitiveness proofed and North-South proofed.  There is a considerable amount of proofing.  We also conduct regulatory impact assessments of all new policies and legislation.  We must bring much of this together.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">We have universal access to hospitals.  We do not have universal access to primary care free of charge and the hospitals apply a small charge.  The issue with hospitals is the length of time it takes to access services.  A central feature of the new consultants' contract is that access to diagnostic services for consultants' outpatients is to be on the basis of medical need and nothing else.  The resource allocation group, which is examining in an in-depth and robust way the manner in which we allocate resources not only to hospitals, but between hospitals and community care and so on, will provide us with good insights into this matter.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
          the comparisons she has made between the costs of running similar services in the public and private hospital sectors; the degree to which differences have emerged in the value of health insurance claims made by patients in respect of each of these sectors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  
        [10546/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_499" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_720">As Minister, I am concerned to see that health care is provided in a way that is affordable and sustainable for the country as a whole and, most of all, that the resources we devote to health achieve the best possible outcomes for patients and the best health status for the population.  I do not have a role in the day-to-day operation of either private hospitals or private health insurance providers, nor should I.  The negotiation of fees between private hospitals and health insurance providers is a commercial matter for the parties themselves.  It is not possible, therefore, for me to make direct comparisons of the type suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">It may be useful to note that the Department of Health and Children is currently undertaking a value for money and policy review of the economic cost and charges associated with private and semi-private treatment services in public hospitals. The review seeks to determine the extent of the gap between current charges and actual costs in public hospitals.  The review does not seek to compare costs between similar services in the public and private hospital sectors, since it is not considered that this should be the key consideration in setting the level of charge in public hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">It is also the case that the National Treatment Purchase Fund negotiates treatment prices with private and, to a limited degree, public hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2008 examined the NTPF's arrangements for the procurement of treatment.  It concluded that, relative to the casemix benchmark, procedures purchased from private hospitals by the NTPF generally cost less than those carried out in the publicly funded hospital system.  However, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, the actual prices payable have not been disclosed publicly.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Where the HSE decides to purchase an element of service from the private sector, the executive satisfies itself that the price paid compares favourably with known costs in the public hospital system.  Such arrangements are also of course subject to the normal rules on public procurement.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_500">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_724">I take issue with the Minister when she says she should not have a role.  There is a role for the Oireachtas and for someone within the public service in controlling the costs of medicines, medication and medical procedures.  This should not be left to commerce, of itself.  In view of the VHI monopoly there has been a failure to drive down the cost of medical care.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">While it may be difficult to get information in the hospitals sector, a report by PA Consulting found that in the community sector private home care can be got for €21 per hour while public care costs €28.  This is because the HSE pays €18 per hour and clients are charged €12.  How can this be and what does the Minister intend to do about it?  Will she take an initiative to drive down the cost of medical care?</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Why do we have such medical inflation when drugs such as proton pump inhibitors, which suppress acid secretion in the stomach, have been developed?  Years ago, people had major gastric surgery for this problem but this is no longer the case.  We should be making savings.  It is not all one-way traffic and it should not be.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_501" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_727">We have been driving down costs.  This year we will take €240 million out of the drugs cost, for example, by changing the manner in which pharmacists are paid and what we pay producers of medication which goes off patent.  The nursing homes support scheme, A Fair Deal, is a good example of saving.  The NTPF was asked to procure beds because it has a good track record in procuring services and getting value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">The HSE uses private providers of home-care packages.  I support that although I am often criticised for it.  If the money can go further and provide more services to people at home and if the quality of the service is assured, that is what we should be concerned about.  I want to see more of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">It is not appropriate for me, and it is against the law, to get involved in price negotiations with hospitals on behalf of insurers.  I want to see insurers driving down their costs.  The costs of some medical procedures are driven, to a large extent,  by salary levels.  On the public side, we must move to economic costing.  The taxpayers cannot subsidise the cost of care for some while it is not accessible to others.  The review currently being carried out is looking at whether public hospitals should move to procedure-based costing.  In private hospitals the insurers negotiate a price for a procedure.  In public hospitals it is based on the number of bed nights per patient.  We need to bring greater clarity to this matter.  The allocations group's report will greatly help us gain insights in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">It must be said that in some cases public provision is cheaper, is of better quality and gives better value than private.  The traffic is not all in one way.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">I believe progress has been made in patient-level costings, whereby insurance companies pay an agreed cost for a procedure rather than for a bed.  I understand the HSE looked at the German system and I would be interested to know if we are to progress to that kind of system, which would facilitate moving towards a "money follows the patient" model.  We are all interested in moving towards that kind of universal system, in which one pays for what is done rather than paying lump sums to hospitals simply because they happen to exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">Doctors who work out of hours are paid a fee per item or per patient.  In the Republic that cost €108 million and in Northern Ireland, for the same number of people, the cost was £18 million.  We must be very careful how we allocate resources.  That is why we appointed a group of experts to advise in this area.  This is important, particularly when resources are limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Public hospitals are paid by insurers on the basis of a bed charge per night.  Doctors are paid separately.  They are paid for every private patient who comes into the hospital, regardless of which bed the patient occupies.  The hospital is paid only for the designated beds.  Many issues arise in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">We must drive down costs. I share Deputy O'Sullivan's view that many long-term patients in the public system have much higher levels of dependency and are more complex cases.  We must be sure we are comparing like with like.  A patient who requires more nursing care and support will cost more than one who does not require the same level of care.  When we compare costs we must be fair in the comparisons we make.</p>

            <p eId="para_737">The Minister mentioned the NTPF.  How does it assess value for money of procedures accessed in private facilities?  The Minister has given approval to 1,000 bed cuts in acute hospitals by the HSE in 2010.  Will  this not result in more people seeking access to specific procedures through the NTPF?  If we are to close public beds in public hospitals we cannot cater for the normal throughput in those hospitals and people will be on longer waiting lists for specific procedures. This will place a greater strain on the NTPF and an additional cost on the taxpayers who fund it.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">There have been recent reports that consultants are not adhering to the agreement to do 20% private work and 80% public.  In some cases it is reported that consultants are doing 100% private work and are in clear breach of their contract.  What monitoring is in place and what measures will the Minister take to ensure compliance by these consultants with their contracts?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_745">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 74 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I am pleased to confirm that work has already begun on putting a national colorectal screening programme in place.  The programme will initially be offered to men and women aged between 60 and 69 years.  Screening will commence in early 2012 following an intensive period of preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and women in Ireland.  Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 1,000 people die from the disease each year.  A successful national screening programme has the potential to reduce mortality from this cancer significantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The programme will be provided by the National Cancer Screening Service.  The immediate focus in preparing the programme is on colonoscopy capacity, accreditation and training.  Based on expected uptake and incidence rates, it is estimated that approximately 6,000 colonoscopies will take place each year within the screening programme.  Approximately 59,000 colonoscopies are performed in the public hospital system annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Last December the National Cancer Screening Service invited 37 publicly funded hospitals, which provide endoscopy services, to submit expressions of interest to be considered as a screening centre.  Between ten and 12 screening centres will be required by the programme.  Some 28 hospitals have now expressed an interest in participating in a national programme.  One of the criteria for hospitals wishing to participate in the programme is that they reduce waiting times for urgent colonoscopies to fewer than four weeks prior to the initiation of the screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">The National Cancer Screening Service is now preparing to undertake a baseline analysis of each hospital endoscopy unit.  The outcome of the baseline analysis visits will identify potential areas for improvement and additional investment and staffing requirements.  The National Cancer Screening Service will report these findings to my Department.  It has already been decided that additional advanced nurse practitioners will be trained to provide additional capacity in the colonoscopy screening centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The screening programme will not be allowed to adversely affect waiting times for urgent colonoscopies in the symptomatic services.  The need to comply with the four week time limit for urgent colonoscopies has been emphasised to the National Cancer Screening Service and the HSE and I am satisfied that there has been an enormous improvement in the capacity to deliver on this commitment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_752">It is often pointed out to us that it is difficult for GPs, for example, to say whether a colonoscopy is urgent.  The Minister should not just concentrate on urgent colonoscopies and the need to reach the target of four weeks.  As I said, it is very hard to know whether a colonoscopy is urgent and all colonoscopies need to be carried out within a safe period of time.  Will the Minister address that issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_753">Is it intended that advanced nurse practitioners will do the screening?  Will gastroenterologists be involved as well?  There is a concern that the capacity will need to be increased considerably if the screening is not to affect the regular symptomatic colonoscopies required.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_512" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_754">All cancer experts would say one must distinguish between urgent and non-urgent, not only in this area but in regard to symptomatic breast disease.  Professor Keane has worked with the College of General Practitioners on referral protocols for doctors.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">Professor O'Donoghue has been appointed as the lead for the roll-out of the colorectal screening and he is probably well known to most people in this area.  The breakdown between consultants, doctors and nurses involved has yet to be determined but we want to empower nurses as much as possible.  In many other countries, this service is provided by advanced nurse practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">In regard to the hospitals that will be selected, a group which advised in the UK will be part of the advisory team visiting the 28 hospitals which have expressed an interest.  There is no question of the screening programme being done at the expense of the day-to-day service and that must be factored in.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_513">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_757">Will the colonoscopy service be expanded by 2012?  I make the observation that this will all be hospital-based.  Surely we are missing a golden opportunity to implement this as a community-based service which would achieve two things, namely, it would bring the service closer to patients and it would not allow for the possibility of interference with the symptomatic service because it would be community-based and a separate service.  There is absolutely no reason colonoscopies cannot be done in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">I understand from speaking to several surgeons that suspected cases of breast cancer receive preferential treatment, in terms of being brought in to be operated on, over established cancers of the bowel and lung and other cancers in women and men.  We do not want the same thing to happen with the colonoscopy.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that and on why the screening programme will not be community-based.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_514" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_759">We are effectively going to provide a home screening service.  The kits will be sent to people and, to a large extent, they will be providing the service for themselves.  Some 6% will require follow up by way of a colonoscopy, so that is a relatively small number out of the 200,000 who will be screened every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">It is not envisaged that we would extend it beyond 60 to 69 years of age in the initial phase.  Every new programme must be phased in, as was done in Sweden, Finland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">It would not make sense to duplicate a service in the community which we currently have at hospital level.  We want ten or a maximum of 12 centres nationally.  All the advice from both the Health Information and Quality Authority and the National Cancer Screening Service was that for many reasons, these colonoscopies should be done at hospital level.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_515">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_762">Given that bowel cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women, that its incidence increases with age and that it is projected that the population for the 60 to 69 age group in 2012 will be in excess of 278,000, can the Minister guarantee that she will have the necessary roll-out to ensure a comprehensive screening of that population?  Following on from that, will she have <i> in situ</i> the required treatments and supports for those who have been diagnosed with bowel cancer as a consequence of that screening exercise?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_516" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_763">Where somebody requires follow up, either a colonoscopy or treatment, that will be integrated as part of the service as it is with the breast screening service or the cervical cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">On the population to be screened, initially we are talking about people from 60 to 69 years of age.  Half of the cancers occur in that age group.  The resources will be made available and I acknowledge the support of the Irish Cancer Society which is providing resources towards the implementation of this programme, which is very helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">We have learned from other countries that we need to invest hugely in advance publicity and information because it is a very different screening programme.  It will be the first screening programme involving men and the first screening programme where much of the screening will be self-screening using the kit that will be sent out.  We need to be involved in advance publicity and information campaigns and they are currently being devised.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 67 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The board of the Health Service Executive has begun the recruitment process for the next chief executive officer of the HSE as the contract of the current CEO, Professor Brendan Drumm, expires in August this year.  In accordance with section 17 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE board is responsible for making the appointment.  That Act stipulates that the recruitment process must be in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">I understand the recruitment process initiated by the board is being conducted in accordance with the code of practice issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Much of the information about this competitive process is, by its nature, confidential, such as information about applicants and interviews, and it is not appropriate, therefore, for me to seek access to the details sought by the Deputy.  However, I understand the intention of the board is to ensure the process will be complete in time for an orderly handover of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">Public advertisements for the position were placed nationally and internationally in December 2009.  As part of the recruitment process, an executive search and recruitment company, Amrop Strategis, has been engaged by the board following competitive tender to conduct an international search for the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The salary rate for the post is €228,466.  This is the same as the current salary rate for the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and is in line with the recommendations of the review body reports in 2007 and 2009 for the CEO of the HSE.  A higher remuneration level was approved for the current CEO on his appointment to reflect the particular challenges for the first appointee to the post.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">The Minister named the firm involved in the recruitment process.  What will be the cost of the process and how much will the company in question charge?  How many internal and external applications have been received for the position of chief executive of the Health Service Executive?  When will the appointment be made?  I presume the rumours that the vacancy is the subject of the recruitment embargo are untrue.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">The cost will be €34,000, excluding VAT.  I understand the company in question approached 113 potentially suitable candidates and subsequently met 25 of these candidates.  I also understand 40 responses were received as a result of an advertisement placed in newspapers.  A shortlist of ten candidates has been drawn up and it is expected that interviews will be conducted during this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The cost of the advertising campaign was €25,055.  Advertisements were placed in <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Economist</i>.  I am pleased to note <i>The Economist</i> was used.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_782">The term "rare disease" refers to conditions with a low prevalence of no more than five per 10,000 persons in the population.  It is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 distinct rare diseases affecting in total between 6% and 8% of the population over the course of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">I have met with the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry, IPPOSI, which represents rare disease patient organisations and industry and the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, GRDO, on issues relating to health care for patients with rare diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">Research on rare diseases is scarce and scattered in different laboratories throughout the European Union.  Owing to the small market, investment in medicinal products and devices for people with rare diseases is limited.  As a result, the price for many of the treatments is such that it is impossible for them to meet conventional criteria for cost effectiveness.  Progress has been made on specific rare diseases such as haemophilia.  Through the work of the Haemophilia Produce Selection and Monitoring Advisory Board, the cost we are now paying for blood products has reduced substantially in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">I have asked the clinical director of the Health Service Executive, Dr. Barry White, to explore a mechanism whereby a ring-fenced drugs budget could be put in place to specifically cater for people with other rare diseases.  Work has also commenced on other elements of rare disease policy such as screening procedures and the organisation of reference centres and clinical networks involved in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">In view of the low prevalence of rare diseases, there is added value in working collaboratively at EU level and Ireland has supported the EU Council recommendation on an action plan for rare diseases which was adopted in June 2009.  Ireland has two years to prepare a national plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">While I do not have a figure on the numbers involved, it is anticipated that between 6% and 8% of the population is affected by a rare disease.  Support is provided for many rare diseases, for example, haemophilia.  In a constrained budgetary environment it is difficult to make choices where one product may help 1,000 people and another product only ten people.  I have had a good engagement with Dr. Barry White and we may ring-fence a sum of money each year to be allocated to budgets for rare diseases.  This would avoid the challenge such budgets face from disease groups with much larger numbers of patients.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_795">I thank Deputies for their remarks on the genuine efforts we have made in this group of amendments to try to keep as many people as possible out of prison for non-payment of fines, while ensuring that those on whom fines are imposed ultimately pay what is due.  We had to be careful to ensure the provisions did not give rise to a significant number of additional court hearings, a concern raised by Deputy Charlie Flanagan.  For this reason, we set out to minimise the number of court hearings and ensure court time is not wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">If a fine of, for instance, €1,000 is ordered, a recovery order is issued and a receiver designated to take goods in lieu in the event of non-payment of the fine.  At that stage, reference is not made to prison.  However, if a receiver returns to the court with a <i>nulla bona </i>- no goods — at that point, the case would be re-entered to the court, the person assessed for a community service order and, with his or her consent, requested.  The court would then make a community service order or impose imprisonment in default of complying with the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">We considered introducing a threshold of perhaps a couple of hundred euro under which imprisonment would not be imposed.  We found, however, that as there would be no sanction or onus on persons who were unwilling to pay a fine, such persons would be able to circumvent the system and avoid paying a fine.  For this reason, imprisonment was required as the ultimate sanction.  We also concluded that the inclusion of a threshold could result in judges increasing the fine above any threshold introduced in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I presume the clock starts now.  On the recovery order in section 16, subsection 2 states: "Before making a recovery order, the court shall conduct an inquiry into the financial circumstances of the person who has failed to pay the fine concerned and may require the person to provide the court with such information as it may specify relating to those circumstances."  Although I am not speaking specifically to the amendments we are dealing with now — I wish to give notice that I will not be moving amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 51 — they do deal with this area.  We are seeking to ensure that all possibilities are exhausted concerning a person's particular set of financial circumstances.  That person's outgoings should potentially be taken into account also in adjudicating on the issue before going to a recovery order.  We want to ensure that a person who is not a serial offender or a hardy perennial before the courts, and who may have transgressed but who ordinarily is a very good citizen, would have every opportunity to pay the fine if they do not have the means immediately at their disposal.  I would like to get further clarity on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">Deputy Charles Flanagan raised the issue of community service orders supervised by the probation service.  In 2009, there were 1,667 such orders, which is up from 1,413 the previous year.  While there has been an increase, it is true to say that community service orders have not been used as expansively as we would like.  This legislation will send a strong signal from the Oireachtas to the Judiciary in that regard.  As I said earlier, there is a sequencing of the stages involved.  As Deputy Flanagan would know from his time in the District Court, particularly concerning civil debt cases, the number of times somebody has to attend court to pursue a debt is laborious, expensive and frustrating.  We are trying to ensure that this system is as efficient and effective as possible, while reducing the level of Garda and prison involvement for a number of reasons.  The main premise, however, is to avoid imprisoning ordinary, decent people who may be coming before a court for the first time.  We are trying to ensure that those who can afford to pay, but refuse to do so, will face considerable sanction.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Deputy Sherlock referred to people's ability to pay.  Section 13 places an onus on the court, when imposing a fine, to take into account a person's capacity to pay.  Having examined the Deputy's amendments Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, we consider that the legislation encompasses what is required, including a person's income and outgoings.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">We examined the issue of attachment of earnings whereby money would be deducted regularly from a person's wages or social welfare payments.  Many people who come before the District Court are on low incomes, including those on social welfare.  Nonetheless, 75% of them are able to afford a car because 75% of cases heard before the District Court concern motoring offences.  If this new process does not work properly, however, I would be open to considering amending legislation to examine the issue of attachment.  I am interested in the views of Opposition Deputies on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">With regard to the question of naming and shaming, amendment No. 79 would give the Courts Service the ability to publish the names and details of fine payment defaulters.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">The question of the court being obliged to inform an offender of the right to apply to pay a fine by instalments was raised on Committee Stage by Deputy Charles Flanagan.  I undertook to consult the Attorney General on this point.  There is no legal reason a court should not be obliged so to inform an offender.  While it might be argued that offenders will become well aware of the instalment option once it becomes operational, the effect of this amendment could, in a small number of cases, avoid subsequent problems in paying the fine.  Therefore, I thank the Deputy for raising this point, which will improve the Bill.  I do not see any need for the remaining elements of Deputy Flanagan's amendment concerning the question of payment by instalments, which is more adequately covered in the Bill.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_942">(2) In any particular case, the Courts Service shall not publish a person's name and address in accordance with this section before the notification of the receiver under <i>subsection (4)* </i>of <i>section 15 </i>of the person’s failure to pay the fine by the due date for payment.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_943">(3) In this section "due date for payment" means, in relation to a fine—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_944">(<i>a</i>) the date specified by the court that imposed the fine as being the date by which the fine is required to be paid, or</p>

          <p eId="para_946">This amendment relates to the publication of a list of names of persons who fail to pay fines on time.  Some persons in the community fail to pay their fines and take a chance on a warrant for their imprisonment not being executed.  If their warrant is executed, they may pay the fine at the last second to avoid imprisonment or may even go to prison on the basis that it will be, at most, only for a day or two.  The cost to the State in Garda time and of admission of offenders to prison are substantial when calculated over a year.  The changes I have already provided for in previous amendments should greatly reduce the level of default.  However, it would be naive not to assume that a hard core of defaulters will continue to defy the State by refusing to pay their fines.  In this amendment, I introduce a name and shame scheme, whereby fine defaulters will have their names and addresses published at regular intervals.  It will be administered by the Courts Service, which can publish the list in a way most convenient to it and, possibly, on the Internet.  From the point of view of this proposal, a person is considered to be in default from the date the receiver is informed by the Courts Service of the person's failure to pay the fine by the due date of payment.  This is an innovative proposal aimed at attaining the maximum acceptance with court orders to pay fines.  Some persons will ignore all of the other attempts to collect the fine, but I am satisfied that many of these would not want their neighbours, families or friends to know they are not paying their debt to the State.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_947">I welcome this amendment.  I agree with the Minister with regard to every effort being made to ensure that money lawfully due to the Exchequer, following the imposition of fines after a court hearing and due process, is collected and that the law is seen to take its course.  However, I am sure there are administrative consequences, in terms of an extra burden on the Courts Service.  The Minister has not given specific details as to how this will work in practice.  Will it work in a similar way to Revenue, and will we see publication on specified dates such as 30 June and 30 December?  Have such arrangements been set in place with the Courts Service?</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I refer to the point made earlier by the Minister with regard to the reluctance of his Department to proceed by way of attachment of earnings.  This is something Fine Gael proposed previously, not only in this legislation.  If we had a provision for attaching a court order to a person's wages or, if unwaged, to social welfare payment or entitlement, we would not need such publication, because payment would be made automatically.  I welcome the Minister's statement that we will have a review in the future where the matter of attachment orders will be looked at in some detail.  I assume the Minister does not have a difficulty in principle with such orders since he has said the issue will be reviewed.  If the courts had such a provision available, it might only be invoked in circumstances where the sitting judge was happy that it was appropriate in the circumstances.  Then we would not need the publication of a list of names of persons who failed to pay fines on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">However, pending such a review, I am happy to accept what the Minister has said.  Perhaps he is in a position at this stage to elaborate on the mechanics of such an arrangement.  Will it be twice yearly?  Will it be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil  </i>or will it be available to the newspapers by press release or will it be in the form of an advertisement in the national newspapers?  Will it be published locally in the District Court area which imposed the fine?</p>

          <p eId="para_950">I am not against the amendment <i>per se, </i>but it states that the Courts Service “may” from time to time, publish in such a manner as it considers appropriate, including on the Internet, a list of the names and addresses of persons who have failed to pay fines imposed on them by the due date of payment.  I assume, since the word “may” is used that there is no obligation on the Courts Service to publish the names.  Without being sarcastic, when somebody presents himself or herself before the court, there is a good chance the court reporter from <i>The Corkman </i>or <i>The Leitrim Observer </i>or any other local newspaper will publish the person’s name in the following edition.  I suggest the persons concerned will have been subjected to enough embarrassment through that.  There may be circumstances where this imposes another administrative cost on the Courts Service.  I do not think the Minister has set out how much this will cost to administer.  By virtue of use of the word “may”, I wonder if it will ever be used at all.  That is a question, by the way.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_568" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_951">I thank the Deputies for their support in principle for this proposal.  We are not obliging the Courts Service to publish this information.  This is a new system for recoupment of fines so we must wait and see how it operates.  The Courts Service is entirely computerised now so it is well able to get all the information.  I suspect that rather than publishing it in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> at some expense it will place it on the Internet, where it will be easily accessible.  It may do this periodically or on a rolling basis; I do not know.  The finer details will be left up to the Courts Service.  However, it should not be a major administrative burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">This legislation is designed to focus on the hard core of people who purposely default on payment of fines.  We are not trying to go after people who have difficulty repaying fines due to their particular circumstances.  We must remember that even before the fine is levied by the court, the court has an obligation to consider the person's capacity to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Deputy Flanagan mentioned earlier the removal of ministerial discretion to reduce fines.  I have sympathy with this point of view because I know from my constituency work what has happened as a result of that change.  Let us say somebody forgets to go to court.  As Deputy Flanagan said, if the person does not appear in court the judge normally applies the higher end of the scale when it comes to a fine.  It used to be that the person could go to the local TD, a petition was opened and the fine might be reduced.  Now the person cannot do this and he or she must instead go to the extreme expense of employing a solicitor, possibly even a barrister, to appeal the fine in the Circuit Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">People have come to me — I have no doubt other Members have had the same experience — with fines of €1,000 or €2,000 because they missed court appearances; they have faced a Hobson's choice of, in effect, throwing good money after bad by employing solicitors and appealing in the Circuit Court, with a risk that the fines may not be reduced or may even be increased.  This has imposed significant burdens on people whom I will not call innocent but who are perhaps at the wrong end of the scale of offenders.  In this legislation we are attempting to ensure such circumstances are considered and to be more humane by allowing payment by instalments and so on.  People will also be able to repay their debts to society through community service orders where before they would have been sent to prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">I thank Deputy Flanagan for accepting in principle the concept of attachment, which we will consider.  If we find the system we establish does not work properly, we are considering — as an alternative at the other end of the scale to imprisonment — providing the option to an offender, even after receiving a community service order or the ultimate sanction of prison, of accepting a court order for attachment of his or her earnings or social welfare payments rather than going to prison.  However, we can consider this another time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_966">I wish to raise a question which relates to the legislation.  I do not intend to cause any difficulties because these are largely technical amendments but I thought they would cover a specific issue.  A press statement from the Minister concerned an issue raised by the Labour Party during the earlier debate in the Dáil and indicated it was being addressed.  I want to be clear on where exactly in the Bill it is being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">The Minister's press release states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_968">Under the new law, TV3 for Play TV and RTÉ for competitions such as on the "Late Late Show" will come under the regulatory regime of ComReg.  They will be obliged to have a licence to operate and must abide by the conditions of that licence.  Failure to comply will result in possible suspension or revocation of the licence and broadcasters can be fined up to €250,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">As I understand it, those operating without a licence can be fined up to €250,000 but failure to comply with the conditions of a licence does not have this penalty attached.  On an earlier Stage, Deputy Penrose proposed an amendment which suggested this kind of penalty for the offence of providing an unlicensed service.  There would also be an offence for breaching the terms of a licence.  It was described as a <i>carte blanche</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">At the time the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_971">I accepted a number of amendments but this is one I cannot accept.  As a matter of policy it is not considered appropriate that the breach of the condition of a licence should be an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">My legal advice is that there is a problem in this.  The legal advice is quite strong and indicates that the statement made by the Minister by way of a press release is untruthful and grossly misleading.  I do not know if that is the case but it is certainly a very serious matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">It seems that the press release is very specific in stating that the Minister has presented this Bill and there are new provisions in it.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Minister is indicating in the press release that the premium rate service providers will be obliged to have a licence to operate and must abide by the conditions of that licence, with a failure to comply resulting in possible suspension or revocation of the licence.  He also indicates broadcasters can be fined up to €250,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">I do not see provision in the Bill where a broadcaster who breaks the conditions of licence could be fined €250,000, although the Minister has indicated this.  I do not want to challenge the Minister but I cannot see it.  I am looking for information on what was put into a press statement on this legislation.  Where is the provision as the Labour Party thought it should be included and put forward an amendment to that effect which was rejected because the Minister did not think it appropriate?  The press release makes it very clear that a breach in the conditions of a licence would leave a company open to being fined €250,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The press release is from 27 January 2010 and perhaps the Minister will clarify the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_573" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_976">I would be pleased to do so.  The fine of €250,000 applies for somebody providing a service without a licence.  Where someone is in possession of a licence but in breach of conditions, we are giving the power to revoke the licence.  If somebody was to continue in operation in those circumstances, the €250,000 fine would apply.  The immediate effect is revocation, which does not have the fine attached, but this comes into play if somebody continued a service without a licence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_574">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_977">With all due respect, that is not what the press release stated.  It did not indicate that if a person continues after losing a licence he or she thereby runs the risk of the fine.  That is a couple of stages down the road.  It states that "failure to comply will result in possible suspension or revocation of the licence and broadcasters can be fined up to €250,000."  Anybody reading that would think that unless the conditions are complied with, there is the possibility of a fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Play TV is operating at the moment and I hope TV3 sorts this out by simply ending the contract it has with Play TV.  I urge it to do so as this legislation does not seem to tackle the scam being perpetrated by Play TV on a particular station on television.  It is up to TV3 to sort it out and I hope it does so.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I am concerned by the statement made by a Minister — which may have been inadvertent — and my legal advice called it dishonest.  The Minister might retract the press release and say that at the very least it was ambiguous.  To any person reading the statement, it was grossly misleading.  We pursued the matter in the House and tried to convince the Minister about it.  We now see a subsequent press release claiming that what was not the case is now the case.  If people read that, they would read that failure to comply will result in possible suspension or revocation, and that broadcasters can be fined up to €250,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">The legal advice is that the underlined words clearly state that failure to comply with conditions of a licence will result in a fine of up to €250,000.

It acknowledges that the NRA, through the local authority, provides a duct to a telecommunications company and charges for that.  There is no effective change, but is purely a language issue to recognise the three different bodies involved.  The local authority was not as explicitly mentioned in the previous version.</p>

There has been a great deal of publicity in respect of the latter as a result of comments made by the Minister and Deputy Coveney.  This, more than anything, illustrated the kind of rip off that can occur when the proper oversight and scrutiny are not in place.  I welcome the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">I am glad the Bill has been passed.  We took some liberties in respect of it that are not part of common practice in the House.  Halfway through the process, we added an entirely new section which has nothing to do with premium rate services.  That section is designed to facilitate the State in opening up ducting that is already in place in various areas in order to allow public and private companies to lay broadband fibre.  That is an important development and we were probably right in facilitating it in this Bill because legislation which would be suitable for this purpose is not forthcoming at present.  Opposition parties, even though they pointed out the unusual nature of the process, assisted in facilitating this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">I encourage the Minister and his Department to go a little further in respect of broadband and ducting.  Now that we have done what we should be doing with State-owned ducting infrastructure, we should consider, by means of regulation, opening privately-owned infrastructure up to fibre to be provided from the marketplace.  In addition, the promised one-stop-shop — which has been on the agenda for some time- should be put in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_1014">On the previous occasion I was referring to the provision of the appropriate level of education for those who have not, for whatever reason, been driving for a period.  It is worth reflecting on the figures in this regard.  According to the Road Safety Authority, a total of 18,851 people were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2007.  A total of 18,053 people were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2008.  Another interesting statistic relates to the number of people who are disqualified from driving.  The number of such individuals in 2008 was 12,213.  In excess of 11,000 of these people received disqualifications from driving on foot of alcohol-related offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The figures I have outlined highlight the need to have a mechanism in place whereby the people to whom I refer — among whose number are included those who may have spent time in prison — can become reacquainted with the skill of driving.  The company to which I referred on the previous occasion, which is associated with Carlow Institute of Technology, the county enterprise board and UCC, is providing such a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">It is extremely important that we should reflect on the impact of all legislation that passes through this House.  In the context of this Bill, we must ensure that something positive and tangible is done in order to ensure that those who are prevented from driving for a period — including those who, for one reason or another, spend time in prison — should be able to refresh their driving skills.  The RSA has been approached in respect of this matter and it should reflect on the proposition that has been put to it.  In addition, it should make some effort to ensure that such a system of re-education should be put in place in order that it might operate alongside the provisions in this legislation.  I am informed that the technology employed by the company to which I refer is the best in Europe and that it is actually only available in Ireland at present.  The provision of a system such as that which I have outlined is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Another matter of concern in the context of the Bill is the lowering of the blood alcohol level from 80 mg to 50 mg.  The debate in respect of this issue has given rise to a wider discussion on rural Ireland and how we look upon it.  To some degree, the matter has been taken out of context.  I must declare an interest in that I have an interest in a building in which a public house is located.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The issue of connectivity to and within rural areas has been brought into sharp focus as a result of the debate to which I refer.  The Minister referred to a study relating to integrated rural transport services.  I accept that a body of experts may have been appointed to examine the position in respect of such services.  However, I am of the view that those we should consult on rural transport are those who provide it.  Private bus operators provide rural transport services in every county.  Such operators have expert knowledge on connectivity within the counties they service and they should be consulted.  In my county, J. J. Kavanagh &amp; Sons provides a national bus service and it should have an input in the context of indicating how best to achieve connectivity between counties and between rural locations within counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The operators to whom I refer are best placed to indicate how national bus services could be connected to local bus services.  Some €11 million is set aside in the Bill in respect of this matter.  I am of the view that using the model I have outlined would lead to better value for money being obtained.  It would also result in the provision of better services.  We should discuss this matter with these operators because they have first-hand experience of providing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">School transport services are provided in every county.  Ring a Link, which operates in my county, and similar operators provide services under the rural transport initiative.  Why is it not possible for the taxpayers' money provided to each of these operators to be pooled and matched with funds from the private sector in order that people in rural areas might be given access to a comprehensive range of transport options?  That is the kernel of this issue.  The money is already being provided.  Rather than considering the issue in a narrow way, we should adopt a broader approach.  I accept that a reasonable school transport service is provided.  However, serious questions arise in the context of the amount of money being spent on that service and also on the type of service that is being delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">We should consider every aspect of transport in our deliberations.  In the context of the Bill, the issue of transport has been discussed in the context of transporting people to and from public houses or other locations.  We should concentrate on the provision of transport services to members of the public, regardless of where they are going or what they are doing.  It would then be up to the people to support the services provided.  If a service is required and has been requested, people must understand that it must be paid for and that they must subscribe to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The other aspect of safety in urban areas in which I am interested and where much could be done is the money available to local authorities to spend in housing estates or in urban centres.  I cannot understand why there cannot be a more integrated approach between the Road Safety Authority, local authorities and other interested community groups at that level to ensure there are appropriate ramps, chicanes or other measures to reduce traffic speed and to introduce safety aspects, including in estates.  It would remove from debate at local level, and in the policing committees which now exist, the ongoing criticism of road safety measures in estates.  This must be part of any measure we take.  It is absolutely essential that we link the spend to get greater value for money and satisfy those in communities who demand this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">I am delighted the introduction of speed cameras will be rolled out.  It is essential throughout the country.  Despite criticism, work is being carried out on national roads and motorways and the travel time between major urban centres is being reduced and the journeys made safer.  In light of this, the roll-out of speed cameras will take the difficulties out of the present system and put it on a more professional level.  It is disappointing that certain aspects of the Bill will not be introduced until 2011, when we must upgrade certain equipment.  It is amazing how quickly the private sector can recalibrate equipment and make it operational.  As administrators, we find it difficult to get immediate results from projects and they turn into never-ending sagas of finding time, finding the appropriate equipment and recalibrating it.  Years pass and it is not done.  I urge the Minister, not only with regard to this project but also with regard to any road safety measure, that measures are planned and delivered within budget and on time and that this becomes part of the planning of our road safety strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">I welcome the administrative penalties and I am interested to see how they will work.  Overall, the Bill will be positive in what it sets out to achieve.  However, it is essential that the aspects dealing with education and rural transport are rolled out.  We must also ensure greater connectivity between and within counties.  It should be easily achievable with the money available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_599">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_1025">I am glad to make a contribution on the Bill, which I welcome on the whole.  I certainly welcome the provision changing the legal blood alcohol limits.  People might state that it is easy for me to support this measure as I live in a relatively urban constituency with easy access to taxis and public transport and where pubs and restaurants are in walking distance.  There is a large contrast between urban and rural areas and I agree with the comments of the previous speaker on rural transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">We need to develop a rural transport structure and not only to get people to and from the local pub; we also need to ensure connectivity for people living in rural communities who are isolated so they have access to some form of transport.  It behoves all of us to support this because small communities in rural Ireland are an essential part of our make up and we need to ensure those living there are not disadvantaged in any way with regard to access to social services and educational facilities.  Access to larger towns in the region is also very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">My constituency has a large number of local transport operators whose services can be utilised.  It is interesting to note the number of schools which have organised their own transport.  This has been done either by parents or the school itself.  It seems to work well as it is flexible and the operator is able to avail of other business opportunities.  Unfortunately, Bus Éireann is reducing its services.  A balance should be reached between making money on a commercial basis and providing a service to communities.  Without public transport not alone rural communities but also communities with low car ownership will be disadvantaged.  I am aware of a community which is very dependent on public transport for access to hospitals, third level institutions and further education institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Transport is important in regions and rural areas, but nobody can argue with the figures on the effect of alcohol on drivers.  Last year, a conference was held in Dublin at which the effect of alcohol on drivers on Irish roads was discussed.  At the time, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, stated that alcohol may have been a contributing factor in more than 1,000 fatal collisions between 1999 and 2008.  Behind that statistic are many grieving families and communities shattered by the consequences of those accidents.  Many parents have been very brave in telling their story to try to influence other people and reduce the level of road deaths due to alcohol and to increase awareness of the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol.  I commend them on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The Bill reduces the alcohol limit to 50 mg and to 20 mg for novice drivers and professional drivers.  This is to be welcomed and will bring us into line with other EU countries, apart from the UK.  This side of the House welcomes the introduction of the Bill for which we have been calling for some time.  Since the penalty point system was introduced it has had a very positive effect on reducing the number of deaths on our roads.  In 2008, there were 279 road deaths, which was reduced from 458 road deaths in 1998.  That is a significant reduction.  Not all of those deaths were due to alcohol.  I welcome the emphasis on road safety, alcohol, speed, safety belts and the upgrading of some interurban routes.  The motorway from Cork to Dublin is almost complete.  It is a much safer road and anyone who drives on it now feels more secure.  There has been a much greater emphasis on road deaths and road safety.  I continue to support the penalty points system, which is a positive development that has contributed enormously to road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">We need to get to grips with drug driving.  The Bill addresses the fact that an increasing number of motorists are driving while under the influence of drink and drugs in some cases or just drugs in other cases.  Currently, motorists are only tested for drugs following a Garda request if a person is suspected of being intoxicated but there is no evidence of him or her being over the limit for alcohol.  The legislation will give the Garda the power to form an opinion that a driver is under the influence of drugs and to carry out a preliminary impairment test, which is based on co-ordination.  That is a step in the right direction as CSO statistics have shown a rapid increase in the detection of people driving a vehicle under the influence of drugs.  In 2006 there were 117 offences but by 2009 that had risen to 831 offences.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has indicated that drivers driving under the influence of drugs are a significant problem.  That is something we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Between 2000 and 2001 a total of 2,000 blood and urine samples were taken from drivers who appeared to drive erratically.  The results show that of those, 331 who were under the blood alcohol limit had taken drugs and 142 who tested positive for alcohol were over the limit for drugs.  Almost 50% of those who were over the limit were under the age of 25 and more than 90% of them were male.  Ten years later we need to analyse the figures and categorise the 831 people who tested positive for drugs, to establish what age they were and what effect the drugs had on them.  We need to address the issue through legislation and by giving the Garda the power to carry out the preliminary impairment test.  Currently, we do not have any tests that can be carried out at the side of the road even though saliva tests are used in Australia.  We have to be seen to be tough in this regard.  I hope we can introduce a similar system in this country.  It is only if people fear they will be caught and prosecuted that we will see a reduction in the incidence of those offending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">We cannot focus enough on road safety.  We had a debate recently on the reduction of the speed limit in Dublin city centre to 30 km/h.  That has been unpopular in many sectors.  The safety of pedestrians, especially in large housing estates is vitally important.  I represent an area that has many large housing estates with a lot of young children.  People are concerned that roads are not safe, that priority is given to drivers who have easier access and much greater freedoms and that they are not curtailed sufficiently in large urban areas.  There should be more of an emphasis on pedestrians.  They should be king rather than, as is currently the case, cars being king in our urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">It is difficult to get local authorities to provide pedestrian crossings due to a lack of funding.  Reference is made to traffic manuals and the class of the road but pedestrians are not part of the equation in road traffic manuals.  I have had this debate with many local authority engineers.  We need to reverse our thinking and ensure that we have pedestrian crossings at bus stops and adjacent to shops and churches, not just for children but for elderly people as well who find crossing the road intimidating.  Cork is known as a jaywalking city.  I accept it is prevalent in Cork.  I would welcome the provision of facilities such as pedestrian crossings, road ramps and chicanes wherever possible and the reduction of speed limits to 30 km/h in housing estates in large urban areas.  That would alert drivers to the fact that they are entering an area with a large number of pedestrians, young and old.  It is important that speed is reduced and that the safety of the pedestrian is uppermost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">I welcome the fact that penalty points incurred in the State can be applied to foreign driving licences.  That is an important step that follows on from an EU directive.  It was frustrating that those driving in this country with foreign licences could break the speed limit and drive with an excess of alcohol but no penalty points could be attached to their licence.  I am pleased that anomaly is being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I welcome the provisions in the Bill, which are long overdue.  I am disappointed that the facilities to detect the blood alcohol level will not be in place until 2011.  That is a sad reflection on how slow we are to react.  It is difficult to believe that the testing facility cannot be calibrated until 2011.  We had a long saga too with the speed cameras, which were a long time coming.  It was only at the end of last year that the roll-out started.  It was well known that there were no speed cameras and that people would not be caught for speeding.  We finally got them at the end of 2009.  We must take whatever measures we can to highlight road safety.  I commend the Road Safety Authority on its work in this area.  Its television advertisements have been extremely effective.  Many young people's lives have been saved.  The statistics speak for themselves.  Many people have benefited from the actions of that authority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_600">
          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1036">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Road Traffic Bill 2009.  The gestation of this legislation was controversial but the Bill presented to us today is worthy of a broad welcome.  It is important that we have a wide-ranging and thorough Second Stage discussion on the important provisions in the Bill.  This legislation is, above all, concerned with public safety and road safety, that is, protecting people from death and injury on the roads.  Some speakers have acknowledged that priority before pushing it to one side and focusing on other issues.  The reality, however, is that it is an issue that cannot be put to one side.  We are either committed to improving road safety or we are a little blasé about it.  Perhaps it is part of the Irish psyche to be a little blasé about certain issues.  We like everything to work properly but we do not like to be pushed too hard in our exertions to ensure that it does.  This legislation may push people a little further than they would like to be pushed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">In essence, however, the Bill contains a set of practical legislative proposals.  When it was flagged by the Minister some time ago, those proposals were much more severe than what has been presented to the House.  It is important when drafting legislation that one should seek, as far as possible, to ensure public support for it.  There is nothing worse than the Oireachtas passing legislation with which the public is unwilling to co-operate.  Such legislation may make it into the Statute Book but if its enforcement irks people, it will lead only to accusations that we in this House are out of touch with reality.  This Bill represents a practical and sensible balancing of the requirements of public safety against the issues that have been raised since the legislation was flagged.  It has been in the pipeline for some time but that has facilitated the sensible approach that has been taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Some people may not like me saying — which I have no hesitation in doing — that it is likely that we will have to revisit this legislation in due course to introduce stricter penalties.  In that sense, the Bill is a step on the road to improving road safety.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is to be commended on his work in this area.  It is not easy to introduce measures that are unpopular in some areas or with particular sectors.  As a rural representative, I understand all the concerns that have been raised.  While account must be taken of those concerns, the priority must be road safety.  Some 14 people have been killed in the past ten years within one mile of my home, which fronts on to the busy N7.  Some of those accidents were drink-related while others happened as a consequence of driver fatigue or inattention.  We must keep these realities in our mind when fashioning legislation.  Any measure that helps to improve road safety represents a mission accomplished.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The main provision of the Bill is the reduction of the blood alcohol limit and the introduction of an associated administrative and fixed penalty regime.  For ordinary motorists, the limit is reduced from 80 to 50 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.  For those found to have a blood alcohol level between 50 to 80 milligrams, three penalty points and a fine of €200 will apply.  For motorists with a blood alcohol level between 80 and 100 milligrams, a six-month disqualification period and a fine of €400 will be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Recently qualified and professional drivers — which I assume refers to anybody who drives for a living — must adhere to a much lower blood alcohol limit of 20 milligrams.  Any such drivers found to exceed that limit will be subject to a three-month disqualification and a €200 fine.  Nothing frightens people more than coming face to face with a large heavy articulated truck the driver of which has his mobile telephone in hand.  It is an inescapable sight on all our roads.  Perhaps lorry and van drivers have to hold their mobile telephones in hand because their engines are so loud.  When one sees a truck approaching with a 20-tonne load of grit, sand, cement or whatever, one would like to be confident that the driver has not taken any alcohol.  We should all be entitled to that confidence that lorry drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, school bus drivers — all who earn a living from driving — do not have alcohol in their system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">In any event, there is an onus on such people to protect their job, that is, it is in their own interest for professional drivers to be more cautious than ordinary drivers about their driving habits.  However, the provisions in the Bill will place a greater burden on such drivers in that they will have to monitor their alcohol consumption carefully even on a night out, if they are driving the following day.  I have seen people being stopped by the Garda on their way to 10.30 a.m. mass on a Sunday morning even though there may not have been a garda to be seen the night before when mayhem was breaking out in the same town.  We have all seen such anomalies.  That issue  is probably beyond the scope of the Minister for Transport under this legislation but it is a cause for concern.  For example, mothers may be loth to go out for a drink on a Sunday night because of the Monday morning school run.  While anything that restrains alcohol consumption may well be positive in itself, there is a concern that such measures may lead to an increased incidence of drinking at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Behind this legislation is the love affair of many Irish people with alcohol.  I am pleased to note that included in an appendix to the explanatory memorandum is an outline of the regulatory impact assessment that was undertaken of the impact of the proposed changes in blood alcohol limits.  This assessment included a consideration of whether the provisions would have a particular impact on socially excluded or vulnerable groups:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1043">The proposals are not addressed to any particular group, and as their objective is to change driver behaviour in relation to driving having taken alcohol, they do not have an impact on socially excluded or vulnerable groups <i>per se</i>.  The argument has been made as to the potential social impacts if social interactions dependent on driving are affected by a lower BAC level than currently applies, particularly in the case of rural areas.  However, the extent to which social life revolves around drinking is a wider cultural issue but not one which changes the relationship between alcohol levels and driving impairment, or the fact that even a modest reduction in road injuries and fatalities is in itself a huge societal gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">I agree that the social issues arising from the association between alcohol and socialising is a broader societal issue and cannot solely be tackled within the narrow confines of driving legislation.  However, there has been some disagreement on this point and a call for more to be done to address it.  There are measures that can be taken such as encouraging young people to go as a designated driver and encouraging a greater provision of taxi services in rural areas.  I am lucky to live in an area where most of the towns have a taxi service, although there was no such service ten years ago in some cases.  A complaint was made to me during the last election that because there are 194 taxis in operation in Portlaoise, drivers cannot make a living.  While some rural towns have an abundance of taxis, for the customers of small rural pubs that are ten, 20 or 30 miles from a main town, it remains very difficult to get a taxi.  These are issues to consider but, I am in general agreement with the Minister that this is a broader societal issue that cannot be dealt with solely in the context of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">That brings me on to the issue of rural transport.  Laois TRIP is the name of the organisation that manages the Laois rural transport service.  It is doing an excellent job, including providing some evening services such as taking people to mass or to bingo on a Saturday evening.  Although some of those who use the service may get a drink along the way, it is not a drink link as was suggested when it was first mooted.  Such schemes should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">One aspect of this Bill I like is that section 8 deals specifically with mandatory preliminary breath testing for drivers involved in road traffic collisions at or near the scene of the collision where injury is caused or a person requires medical assistance.  It is good that people will know that there will be breath tests in the event of an accident.  People might believe that although they had a jar or two, the accident was not really their fault because the other fellow crossed the line.  However, in the case of those who had a few jars in them when involved in an accident, it is correct that breath tests should be taken at that point in time.  Most people cannot object to this measure, especially when a motor accident has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Having examined the Bill in detail, I ask the Minister to outline, some time before the completion of its passage through this House, what he means by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which is referred to extensively in several sections following on from section 20.  I have never heard of it.  Perhaps I should have heard of it and am declaring my own ignorance but I am unsure whether it an offshoot of another body, is a stand-alone State agency or is one of the famous quangos.  I cannot understand the reason such a body is not under the remit of the Road Safety Authority.  While I have never heard of it, I note its functions are provided for in legislation going back several years.  This Bill contains a provision for the ordering by a court of a person convicted of an offence under various sections to pay to the court, unless there are special reasons for not doing so, a contribution towards the costs and expenses incurred by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in the performance of its functions and section 20 restates the provisions of the Act of 1994.  The Minister might outline whether the bureau is a stand-alone agency or whether it could work elsewhere within the Department of Transport or the Road Safety Authority.  While it is new to me, it obviously has been in existence for decades and constitutes an example of the organisations in operation with which Members are not familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I also am in favour of the Bill's intentions as expressed in section 31, on which I seek clarification from the Minister.  Members are aware of the behaviour of a large minority of those who receive in the post a fixed charge notice for speeding past the camera on the Naas Road or wherever while travelling to Dublin.  However, they then appear in court and declare they never received the notice because the current regime requires it to be posted out.  District Courts around the country have spent hours on end listening to a succession of people taking to the witness box, giving their names, swearing to tell the whole truth, declaring to the judge they never received the notice and consequently having the charges dismissed.  This constitutes a great waste of time for the court, the Garda, the prosecution and it defeats the entire purpose.  Consequently, I hope that details of section 31 will clarify this matter with a view to ensuring that the weakness within the existing legislation will be thrashed out.  At present, it makes something of a mockery of the process when people simply declare they never received the notice in the post.  The first they have heard about it is when they receive a summons because they have not paid the fixed penalty.  They then appear in court and tell the judge they never received the fixed penalty notice in the first place and should not have been summonsed because they were not aware a notice had been issued.  I hope this issue will be clarified because a coach and four is being driven through the current regime at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">Section 47 is another very good section with which many people in Ireland will agree.  It pertains to providing for a new definition of driving licence to include foreign driving licences.  This will bring such licence holders into the scope of the application of sanction for road traffic offences, including disqualification from holding a driving licence.  It is proposed the foreign people who are driving in Ireland on what heretofore would have been called international driving licences but now are being called foreign driving licences and who are in breach of the law can have their licenses revoked with regard to driving in Ireland, which is a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Moreover, I would like to see this extended so that when such people fail to pay tolls, either by simply driving through or by finding a mechanism to not pay them, they also can be chased for these fines as well.  I acknowledge this probably would be a little more difficult but all drivers on the roads should be treated equally, regardless of whether they are from Ireland or from elsewhere.  Many cars from eastern European countries have appeared on the roads here in recent years and it is important that their drivers be subject to the same rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Another point I make in this respect is that I was greatly impressed to see the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, appearing on television today to talk about how fines in respect of motor traffic offences that are issued in Northern Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland can be chased in the other jurisdiction.  I welcome the introduction of this measure because a coach and four was being driven through the law in this regard.  This is not simply a money issue because it also pertains to equity and fairness, in that people in the Republic objected to seeing people coming from the North and putting their foot down once they crossed the Border in the knowledge they could not be caught.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Tánaiste, who is present in the Chamber, represent Border counties and will understand this point.  While the same behaviour probably happens in reverse, people here do not talk about that as much.  Moreover, a town like Buncrana or somewhere similar was mentioned today, which has lost a fortune in uncollected parking fines because they were issued to cars with number plates from Northern Ireland.  It is good to learn that such fines now can be collected and the Minister confirmed all the details a few hours ago and I am pleased in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">I wish to raise one item that may not pertain to the legislation but which relates to the Road Safety Authority.  I have engaged in detailed correspondence and have tabled detailed parliamentary questions in respect of NCT certificates.  A number of constituents have asked questions about this matter and while I am not pressing the case, I simply seek clarification.  I have asked the Minister to clarify the reason NCT certificates are issued on the anniversary of a car's first registration, rather than two years after the conduct of the previous test.  I refer to an example in which one might go abroad for a year, having received certification from the Garda and the garage that one's car was off the road.  In such cases, one is not obliged to pay tax or insurance.  However, one is obliged to have an NCT certificate covering the car for that period.  Consequently, this means, for example, that if one's NCT certificate is 18 months overdue on one's return, one does the NCT test, pays the fee and gets one's certificate.  However, the next test will be due six months later, that is, two years after the previous anniversary because these tests are conducted on a two-year cycle.  The certificates are issued on an anniversary basis and not on whether the car was on the road.  The answer I have received in correspondence is that this practice arises from an EU directive.  However, I doubt whether this has been transposed into Irish legislation in exactly the same manner as is the case in other countries because I am informed that the position differs in respect of such issues in Northern Ireland and in England.  Essentially, if having a car certified by the Garda as being off the road is applicable in respect of tax and insurance, the same facility should apply in respect of the NCT test certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">I also welcome section 61, which I understand relates to a European Union directive.  It provides that third party motor insurance data must be made available through the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland to a person who wishes to make a claim regarding the insurance and ownership details of motor vehicles.  Consequently, if an accident takes place, a person will have the relevant registration number.  It often might be difficult to get it on the site of an accident or a person may not in a position to acquire it due to injuries sustained.  However, if one wishes to contact the other person subsequently, there will now be an onus on the information centre operated by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland to provide such information regarding the details of third party insurance to people within a few days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Another item of information that should emerge in respect of insurance is that I understand there are many cancelled insurance policies on the road.  People take out insurance policies and pay one or two monthly premiums but then stop paying thereafter.  Consequently, such people can drive around for an extensive period with what appears to be a valid insurance disc on the windscreen, although no insurance policy exists to back it up.  Historically, there is meant to be a mechanism for the Department of Transport to notify the local Garda station and the local garda is meant to chase up such cases.  However, this issue should be dealt with by the insurance companies to ensure their certificates are not being abused in such a manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I concur with the previous speaker who raised the issue of speeding in urban areas.  In urban areas or some of the very large new housing estates that can have 400, 500 or 600 houses, the issue of speed ramps and speeding within the estate is very important.  It would be useful were local authorities, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Transport, to take a consistent approach in respect of by-laws on road width in estates.  Some of them can be extremely narrow, which makes it difficult for vehicles to pass in some of the very large estates, in which there are large volumes of cars on the roads and emergency vehicles may not be able to get in or out.  It is important that there be consistency in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">Many new motorways are opening.  They are safer than current roads because, by definition, cars do not drive in opposite directions on the same stretches.  However, I must raise a concern regarding the new phenomenon of large concrete barriers along the middle of motorways.  One could be driving at 120 km/h with a concrete barrier only 1 m or so away.  If one hit it, one would fly all over the place and cause a major accident involving everything following.  Building concrete barriers has been a recent fashion, but the matter should be considered.  If they are causing serious accidents or worsening the situation, they should be removed.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_601">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I welcome the thrust of the Road Traffic Bill 2009 introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  The cornerstone principle of reducing road fatalities must be supported by everyone in society, not least Members of the Oireachtas.  That the fatality rate in road traffic accidents was 63 per million of population in 2008, which represents a decrease of 19% from the 2007 rate of 78 fatalities per million of population, is a significant move in the right direction.  When one takes account of the facts that, since 1998, our population has increased by 19%, the number of registered motor vehicles has increased by 65%, the number of full and provisional driver licences has increased by 35% and the number of road fatalities has decreased by 39%, one can say that something is working.  However, this progress is little comfort to the 279 families that lost loved ones in 2008 through road traffic accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The conventional wisdom, as published by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is that one in three road fatalities involves alcohol.  The proposed reduction in the allowable blood alcohol level is an effort to address this matter.  International research, as presented by the RSA, shows a reduction of up to 18% in fatalities when going from 80 mg per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg per 100 ml.  This could mean the saving of 20 lives on Irish roads every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Will the Minister examine the reasons for the other 200 deaths?  If the RSA could produce the same types of data and awareness campaign and alter public opinion on what is acceptable in society in respect of the factors that cause the remaining two thirds of road fatalities, we could dramatically reduce the numbers dying on our roads every year.  One death is one too many.  The Minister must consider this angle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The debate on the reduction of blood alcohol levels from 80 mg to 50 mg has been held in the House and everywhere else, but this debate and the pursuit of reduced road fatalities should not centre on the contentious and emotive drink driving aspect.  It seems that two out of every three road fatalities are not alcohol-related.  I hope that the Minister does not forget this and I await with interest his proposals to deal with the other factors that result in 66% of road fatalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I have no doubt that, given the nature of modern life, fatigue is and will become an even greater contributory factor in road fatalities.  We travel long distances to work, work longer hours because of our economic situation and cannot avail of an adequate public transport system.  We have a new motorway network with no rest facilities.  It is of deep concern that one will soon be able to travel from Dublin to Limerick on the M7 without being able to stop.  As there will be nowhere to stop along the road, one will need to veer off to avail of services in towns.  This is nonsensical.  This week, it was disappointing to learn about the suspension of the provision of motorway stops.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The UK at 80 mg and Malta at 90 mg are the only other European countries with the same or higher drink driving levels compared with Ireland.  This fact has often been quoted in the debate for moving our rate to the European average of 50 mg.  However, the road fatalities per million figure throws up some interesting facts.  Ireland's figure is 63, the UK's is 43 and Malta's is 37.  I use these figures to underline my point that the Minister, if serious about reducing road fatalities, must examine the other 66% of road fatalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">In 2008, the percentage of fatal collisions occurring on rural roads was 72%.  This is definitely disproportionate and is another prime example of the urban-rural divide.  The weather we have experienced since last November, with rain and severe frost and snow, has had a serious impact on the quality of our road network, particularly rural roads.  Some of our tertiary, local and regional roads, along with our national, secondary and even some national primary roads, are in an appalling state.  It is disappointing that the Minister for Transport has not chosen to address the fundamental problem.  His recent roadworks allocations have made no effort to deal with the destruction of part of our national infrastructure in a meaningful manner.  It is fine for him to state that he is allowing county councils complete discretion in how they spend their allocations, but there is a touch of Henry Ford selling his Model T car in the Minister's allocations, that is, "You can have any colour as long as it is black".  Our local authorities have no choice where their 2010 funding is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Clare County Council recently completed an audit of the damage caused to that county's roads.  On completion of this audit, Mr. Tom Tiernan, the senior engineer, submitted a claim for damages to County Clare's roads totalling €11 million.  This year, the Minister's total allocation for Clare's roads is €15.6 million.  This allocation represents a decrease of approximately 3% on last year's figure.  In a two-year period, Clare has suffered a cut of 33% in road funding allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">This problem will not go away if the Minister does not provide funding.  Our road network will continue to fall into disrepair.  Roads that required attention long before the extreme weather struck have been left in dangerous conditions.  For example, the main road through Clarecastle, the former N18 and now known as the R485, and the R473 Kildysart Road in Clarecastle are in a particularly bad condition and need immediate attention.  I refer to roads throughout east County Clare, particularly in Tulla, Feakle, Whitegate and Mountshannon.  In south-east Clare, I refer to roads like the R465 Broadford-Limerick route and roads around Sixmilebridge and Newmarket-on-Fergus.  In north Clare the N67 Ennistymon to Lahinch road, the R481 Ennistymon to Kilfenora road and roads in Connolly and Kilmaley and right across to west Clare around Kilrush and Kilkee are screaming out for urgent attention.  They need attention.  County Clare's roads desperately require investment.  Filling potholes simply will not suffice.  In many instances it is a waste of money and resources as whole sections of road surfaces need to be rebuilt, surface-dressed and re-laid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The blatant under-funding of County Clare's road network will undermine Clare County Council's five year roads programme.  Roads which were scheduled to receive attention this year, will now be ignored and placed on the long finger.  The Claremont road in Clarecastle, which is near to my home, was due to be upgraded this year.  The road was upgraded to a very high standard five years ago but within months it was torn up for the installation of a gas mains.  It was then torn up to install telecom lines.  There was no liaison between the various utility suppliers and the local authority.  Five years later, the road is in a treacherous condition.  It is now thought that because of cuts in funding, the five year rolling maintenance programme has been shelved and the upgrading will not be completed.  The road will fall apart if it does not receive the attention it requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">If roads are not maintained at a safe standard and potholes are allowed to develop accidents will occur.  We know that poor road surfaces are linked to increases in accidents and fatalities.  I urge the Minister for Transport to revisit this issue and allocate additional funding to repair and improve County Clare's roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The Bill presents an opportunity to deal with rural isolation. There is a link between rural isolation and the reduction in the legal alcohol driving limit along with the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing.  This is something the Minister must acknowledge and do something about.  The Minister must ensure that schemes such as the rural transport initiative are maintained and not scrapped as proposed in the McCarthy report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">I pay tribute to Clare Accessible Transport for the wonderful work it does in providing a valuable transport system to the many people who use its service in County Clare.  The company provides a service on a daily basis, enabling people to shop, go to mass and meet neighbours.  The service is part of these people's daily lives and it should be supported.  It allows people to access transport and prevents them falling into the trap of rural isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">I welcome the provision in the Bill for drugs testing.  I recently met a group of teachers in County Clare to discuss the issue of head shops and of people driving under the influence of the products sold in them.  I heard of a young man who was involved in an accident and admitted to having taken a product sold in a head shop.  As the product was not illegal, he could not be prosecuted.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue.  The question of illegal drugs is mentioned in the Bill.  The Garda no longer needs to suspect a driver of being over the alcohol limit or of using illegal drugs to carry out a preliminary impairment test.  This should be extended to products currently sold in head shops.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to apply the same rigour shown here to all elements of causes of road fatalities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">I compliment the Minister on introducing the legislation and compliment him and the Government on the progress made to date.  The number of deaths on Irish roads has been reduced from 472 to 239 over a ten year period.  Ireland, from being the 16th safest country in 2005 was, last year, the sixth safest country in which to drive.  The Minister tells us we will even improve on that figure.  While it is good news that the numbers are reducing, the number of deaths is still unacceptable.  It is also interesting to note that while 3,000 people died as a result of the Northern Ireland Troubles, during the same 30 year period 10,000 people were killed on the roads in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">One third of all accidents are linked to alcohol.  This creates a major and unavoidable public health problem, the devastation of families, the suffering of victims and an estimated cost to our health services of €500 million.  The proposal to reduce the legal blood alcohol level from 80 mg to 50 mg per 100 ml led to much debate when it was announced last autumn.  I had no difficulty supporting the decision when it was announced, mainly because of the scientific evidence in its favour.  This concludes that a reduction to 50 mg per 100 ml reduced the number of accidents.  In Queensland, Australia, the number of accidents was reduced by a similar reduction from 80 mg to 50 mg by 20%.  In 2008, a British Medical Association report entitled, Alcohol Misuse: Tackling the UK Epidemic, called for such a reduction to 50 mg.  The United Kingdom and Malta are now the only two countries in the EU where the legal limit remains at 80 mg.  The <i>Journal of Safety Research, </i>Volume 36 (2006) pp. 233 – 243, studied the effects of lowering the level to 50 mg in Australia, France, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands.  For all countries, it came to the conclusion that reducing the blood alcohol level reduced the number of accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The relative risk of being involved in a fatal crash as a driver is four to ten times greater for drivers with a blood alcohol limit between 50 mg and 70 mg per 100 ml.  The World Medical Association, at its world assembly in South Africa in 2006 called for the limit to be less than 50 mg.  It suggested between one and 50.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">There is also ample scientific evidence of the effects of blood alcohol levels on the body and on performance.  Between 60 and 100 mg there is psychological sedation of all systems in the body, decreased attention and alertness, slowed reactions, impaired co-ordination, reduced muscle strength, reduced ability to make rational decisions or exercise good judgment, an increase in anxiety and depression and a decrease in patience.  In the light of such evidence, it leaves the Government with no choice but to introduce a level of 50 mg.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">Northern Ireland has a proposal to reduce the level to 50 mg which brings me to the issue of co-ordination and co-operation between North and South in the implementation of road safety measures and penalties.  I welcome this morning's announcement of an initiative by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and Minister Conor Murphy, MLA, on parking and tolling fines.  While it is a step in the right direction, it does not make much contribution to road safety measures.  There are proposals to go further and a proposal has been debated many times at the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body to introduce an integrated penalty points system.  Interestingly, one of the reasons for the slow movement is that there is not an integrated system between Britain and Northern Ireland, so I understand they must get that right first.  I welcome the decisions on the new arrangements for penalties.  The penalty is not as harsh for people with lower levels of alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Driving under the influence of drugs is a matter of serious concern.  There is no breath test available currently, so it is necessary to bring people in for a blood or a urine sample.  No legal limits are set for the level of drugs in the system and more research is needed.  Again, I welcome the decision of the Road Safety Authority to review the regulations in place but we should support more research.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Mandatory alcohol testing has been successful and I welcome its extension to drivers involved in accidents where another person has been injured.  Unfortunately, we need penalties and to avoid breaches of the road safety code.  I would like to think the day will come, sooner rather than later, when we will have a generation of people for whom road accidents will be eradicated or reduced to a minimum.  It is necessary to start with education and information and to develop a healthy attitude to the use of alcohol and the misuse of drugs.  We need to restrict advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Rural pubs have made a good contribution, and continue to do so, in alleviating rural isolation, in particular for elderly people.  Last autumn when the legislation was announced, I met vintners in County Monaghan.  I explained to them why I would support the legislation but asked if they could spend some time with me discussing the decline in the number of customers, because they have problems.  We discussed excise duty, cross-Border trading, the change in people's drinking habits and the availability of transport, which is a major issue in rural Ireland.  I have long advocated that all transport in rural Ireland funded by the State should be integrated to deliver a comprehensive service.  I mention schools and the health service, except the ambulance service, Bus Éireann and voluntary rural transport.  This service could help to ensure a rural scheme at night for people who wish to use it and assist in ensuring safe transport home in situations where alcohol is an issue.  I support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation but it is important we get it right from the beginning and that it is seen to be fair and balanced.  By and large, I agree with most of what is in this Bill.  I appreciate the hard work that has gone into getting it to this point but there are aspects I would like teased out more before it is passed into law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I have been struck by the contributions of many speakers which bear personal testimony to the devastation brought about by road traffic accidents.  I am not immune to this.  My brother, who may well have been destined to be a Member of this House, was killed in a road accident in 1993 and I know first-hand how this affected family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I wish to make a few points, which are important to this debate.  There are equally valid viewpoints that must be taken into consideration.  Rural isolation cannot be ignored.  There are people in my constituency who may have to walk for a half an hour before they reach a public road and walk for well over an hour before they get to the nearest village or town.   There are no street lights, no buses and no taxis for them.  These are the people about whom I am concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The people most affected are usually the older generation who have spent the week on their own perhaps working the farm and getting on with life.  We cannot say to them not to drink and drive and leave it at that.  We must consider ways in which we can alleviate the isolation they feel on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">There are no statistics to show that the person in rural Ireland who goes to his or her local and has one or two drinks is the cause of accidents.  The Bill we pass should not have the side effect of further damaging rural Ireland.  God knows, it is damaged enough already.  Ways must be found to enhance and protect this rapidly diminishing way of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I do not condone drink driving but there are other factors which must be taken into account when considering this Bill.  For instance, it is impossible to ignore the bad condition of our roads in recent months which is due, by and large, to unprecedented weather conditions.  This legislation must reflect that because the condition of our national, secondary, regional and county roads are a major factor in, and the cause of, road accidents.  People now have the added difficulty of trying to avoid large potholes which, in itself, is an extra hazard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">The main artery from Cork city to west Cork is the N71 which has been neglected through the years and is in desperate need of upgrading.  Anybody who has travelled this road will know what I am talking about.  Now that the Cork Swansea ferry service is about to recommence, there will be more pressure on this very important road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">We talk a lot about statistics which show speeding is a major cause of accidents on our roads.  Speed is the main factor contributing to road deaths in Ireland.  More than 40% of fatal accidents are caused by inappropriate and excessive speed.  Young males under 25 years of age driving late at night or early in the morning are involved in a large number of fatal accidents and this is an area to which we must pay more attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">Car crashes are the number one killer of young men aged 16 to 25 in Ireland and driving at excessive speed is the primary cause of these crashes.  I am not here to place all the blame on young Irish males.  Any Bill we introduce, which affects our youth, should also endeavour to enhance and protect them.  In this regard, we should actively provide facilities and events to enable young people to enjoy driving in a safe and proper environment.  Facilities should be also provided for them to learn to drive and practise driving before taking to the roads.  This could be done in transition year or final year.  Similar practices have proven successful internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">All of us have witnessed careless and reckless driving behaviour, including drivers who are unable to concentrate because they are using mobile telephones, people overtaking five or six cars at once and drivers overtaking on double white lines.  We must target such persons because they present a serious threat to road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Before we adopt this legislation, we must be confident we are doing everything in our power to eradicate bad driving habits.  We also must be sure we are not placing greater stress on those who live in isolation in country areas where public transport is not available.  We must discourage people from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or at excess speed.  In doing this, we must ensure we act in a fair and balanced manner.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_606">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1093">I support this Bill which should have the effect of fundamentally changing our culture by ensuring that everyone who gets behind the wheel of a car does so in the full knowledge that new penalties will be imposed for certain driving behaviours.  As a result of this legislation, those who drink will have to significantly change their behaviour.  We need to modify how we, as a society, deal with the issue of alcohol and the only way to achieve this objective is to ensure there is no ambiguity about the blood alcohol limits that apply while driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Having served on Cork County Council with him, I have the greatest respect for the previous speaker, Deputy Christy O'Sullivan.  I, too, am only too well aware of the conditions experienced by rural dwellers who are frequently disadvantaged by virtue of their rural isolation and experience a lack of access to services.  I find it difficult to listen to Government Deputies deplore the state of rural roads and the problem of rural isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">If people are to have access to the services they will require as a result of the measures provided for in the Bill, we must ensure ancillary services are in place to meet their demands and needs.  For instance, in my area Bus Éireann has decided to withdraw the No. 66 route which serves a rural area and individuals living in rural isolation.  They include older people who travel to towns such as Fermoy, Ballyhooly and Castletownroche to enjoy a drop before taking a bus home later in the evening.  Many of these people do not drive and will no longer have access to the service as a result of the decision to close the route.  This problem is a function of Government policy because an ancillary rural transport programme is not in place to pick up the slack arising from the loss of the service.  In particular, a night time bus service is not in place to facilitate those who want to act responsibility but are unable to avail of a bus service.  Government policy militates against the very people who experience rural isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">We need to be clear about the implications of the legislation.  If we support the Bill on the basis that driver behaviour must change significantly, we must also take into account that some people, by virtue of residing in rural areas and deciding to behave responsibly as required under the legislation, will no longer have access to the local pub.  Current policy does not meet their needs.  If Bus Éireann drops routes at a rate of knots and the rural transport programme is not rolled out quickly enough to pick up the slack, particularly with regard to night time services, those who live in the rural areas  obviously will be affected.  This issue needs to be teased out in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">On the commencement of the sections which will become operational before mid-2011, I refer to the Bills digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Unit.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1098">. . . different sections may become operational before others.  Some of the provisions of the Bill will not come into force until mid 2011.  This is because evidential breath-testing (EBT) machines used in Garda stations to measure the alcohol in a driver's breath cannot be recalibrated to the 20mg/100mL limit as yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">What is the current state of play with regard to the Garda's capacity to recalibrate the EBT machines as required?</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">I understand the legislation reduces blood alcohol limits and introduces mandatory alcohol testing for drivers who are involved in traffic collisions as well as roadside preliminary impairment testing to detect drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  One would expect the Government to have ensured all necessary technology was available prior to or in parallel with the implementation of the legislation.  Will the Minister provide an update on the Garda's capacity to use the required technology?</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">On road collision statistics, while I do not doubt the bona fides of the Road Safety Authority, I have a healthy scepticism about some of the statistics produced on road traffic accidents.  The Government has stated its commitment to improving road safety and the number of deaths on Irish roads declined to 240 in 2009.  It is estimated that 25% of road accidents and 33% of fatal road accidents are attributable to alcohol.  I often wonder how such statistics are measured and what process is used by the Road Safety Authority or Garda Síochána to produce their statistics, particularly those relating to road fatalities.  I am not sceptical about the figures but I question the qualitative methods used to compile the statistics used for making an argument for a particular proposal.  I ask for a response in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">I welcome the provisions on new drivers.  We cannot disregard the link between driver impairment and alcohol consumption.  It has been proven scientifically and is supported by anecdotal evidence.  Common sense says that if a person imbibes, their ability to operate a machine or vehicle will be impaired.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Vintners' Federation of Ireland opposed the reduction in the limit and I can see its point.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that their regular rural customers might drink a pint and a drop before ambling home.  They never go beyond their usual level of imbibing, which is a social outlet for them.  We must be able to provide for those who use the pub as a social outlet.  If they are not able to drive, how will we facilitate them?  Some of them will be able to get taxis while others will travel with neighbours.  However, do we now have to tell them that there is no other alternative?  In implementing the legislation, we need to strike a balance and speak for those people as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The section creates a distinction between newly qualified and other full licence holders.  Novice drivers are subject to a lower BAC and will be automatically disqualified for three months if an administrative fixed penalty is accepted, or disqualified for six months if found guilty after a court hearing.  Other licence holders do not face automatic disqualification following a first conviction.  Can the Minister of State clarify if this is an age-related distinction, or does it merely distinguish between novices and experienced drivers?  Is any qualification brought into play concerning an older person who may have transgressed?  It is not that I am advocating a particular position on that, but I am seeking clarification in the Minister of State's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">On balance we are experiencing a serious erosion of services in rural areas.  Some argue that the decline of the rural pub reflects a decline in overall infrastructure, particularly roads.  As someone who meets members of the public every day, I hold that view myself, because they are finding it increasingly difficult to access services.  That is particularly the case for older people.  I would distinguish between older and elderly people, because the use of the word "elderly" sometimes implies a certain infirmity.  Many older people are mobile, although they may not drive.  We always had a sense of inter-generational solidarity in this country, but it is being undermined by stealth.  When drafting legislation we must, therefore, ensure that if it impacts on one service we should try to replace it with another service if possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that lives are saved and one cannot qualify that.  While it is a black and white issue, there are grey areas where some public services will be diminished.  Government policy on rural transport should be structured in such a way that people can access community centres or pubs outside normal office hours if they wish to do so.  We must facilitate them in this respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1107">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an mBille tábhachtach seo.  Ta mé an-sásta go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire, an Teachta Dempsey, as ucht an reachtaíocht a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.  Os rud é gurb í seo seachtain na Gaeilge, ba mhaith liom labhairt ar feadh tamaill in ár teanga dhúchais.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Is ball den Chomhchoiste um Iompar mé agus dá bhrí sin, tá an-suim go deo agam san ábhar seo.  Tá mé i mo chónaí i gceann de na dáilcheantair is mó fáis sa tír.  Ar nós gach éinne eile, feicim sna nuachtáin agus ar na fógraí teilifíse an méid daoine a fhaigheann bás ar na bóithre gach lá.  Tá eolas agam ar an dochar a dhéanann sé dos na teaghlaigh atá fágtha ina dhiaidh.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Tá aidhm an Bhille seo an-simplí — chun na básannna ar na bóithre a laghdú agus chun reachtaíocht bhuan a chur i bhfeidhm do na húdaráis fhorfheidhmithe dlí agus na húsáideoirí bóithre araon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It is a relief that it is being introduced and I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for bringing it before the House.  As a member of the Committee on Transport I have a particular interest in the legislation.  As I just said, as Gaeilge, I live in north Dublin, which is one of the largest and fastest growing constituencies in the country.  As with other areas, I am aware of the number of road accidents that occur daily, some of them fatal and others causing serious injury.  Such road accidents cause grief and suffering to the families concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">The purpose of the Bill is to lessen the tragic loss of life on our roads and, in so doing, provide concrete legislation for law enforcement authorities and all road users alike.  Consolidation and consensus in support of the Government's commitment in the road safety strategy and the programme for Government is a vital cog in the wheel of this legislation.  I fully support the Government's efforts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">Last year, we considered the issues for a reduction in the blood alcohol content, BAC, level for drivers raised in this debate and agreed that the evidence in favour of reducing the BAC levels was conclusive and indisputable.  Reducing the BAC levels from the current limit of 80 mg/ml is one of the most necessary components of this legislation.  The Bill gives effect to reducing the blood alcohol limit from 80 mg to 50 mg for experienced drivers, and 20 mg for inexperienced and professional drivers.  I sincerely welcome this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">It is estimated that in Ireland 25% of road accidents, and 33% of fatal road accidents, are attributable to alcohol.  I am sure we would all agree that these figures are particularly frightening.  Put another way, each of those one-in-three fatal road accidents involves the loss of one or more people because of alcohol usage.  Road fatalities and injuries also have significant financial implications and while this has far less consequence than loss of life, nonetheless it is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">Goodbody Economic Consultants have estimated that the cost of each road death is €3 million, while serious injuries cost €386,000 each.  They also found that if a reduction in the blood alcohol limit to 50 mg resulted in a 2% reduction in road deaths, it would lead to a saving of several lives and €16 million per year.  How can these figures possibly be argued against?</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">Studies have found that reducing BAC limits from 80 mg/ml to 50 mg/ml has resulted in a reduction in road deaths.  A case in point is Australia, where an 18% reduction in fatal crashes and a 14% reduction in serious crashes was recorded in 1983, when the limit was lowered from 80 mg/ml to 50 mg/ml.  Further evidence of ever-decreasing road deaths in Australia since the lowering of the BAC limit has been recorded in Queensland from 1984 to 2008, which experienced a reduction of 35% in fatal crashes during almost quarter of a century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">What more evidence of the benefits of reducing our BAC limits to 50 mg/ml could we possibly need?  The facts speak for themselves.  My strongly held belief is that a zero tolerance policy needs to be enforced for drink driving.  There will always be some who will take the chance, who will take more alcohol than they should and believe they still have the mental capacity to get behind the steering wheel of a vehicle and drive on our roads.  This happens frequently.  The policy should be zero tolerance.  This would communicate strongly that drinking and driving costs dearly and is a risk that should not be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The proposed legislation contributes significantly towards sending this message to all drivers.  If qualified drivers are found to be above the new limit, between 50 mg and 80 mg, they will incur three penalty points for a first offence.  A €200 fine and driver disqualification penalties are also possible.  We cannot ignore the fact that some people will take a risk.  If they do so, they will have to pay the price.  The Bill also introduces a limit of 20 mg for specified drivers, namely learners or professional drivers.  However, I believe professional drivers such as bus or taxi drivers should not be allowed have any alcohol in their system while driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I am well aware that not all road collisions are the result of drinking and driving.  I have a background in insurance and have some reasonable knowledge of the causes of accidents.  A full ban on drink driving should be the optimum outcome of legislation.  Total prevention is better than cure.  We are all aware that current mandatory alcohol testing only occurs at Garda checkpoints, or where gardaí have formed the opinion that the driver may be over the alcohol limit.  This needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Section 8 also provides for the mandatory alcohol testing of drivers involved in road traffic collisions.  This is necessary, never more than now.  If we can verify at the scene of an accident, when possible, whether any or all individuals involved in accidents have alcohol in their system, the test results cannot be disputed later.  Carrying out these tests at the scene can also serve to clear innocent drivers involved of any suspicion that they may have been under the influence of an intoxicant.  It is only right and fair that all doubt be removed with regard to the innocent who are involved in serious or fatal crashes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">With regard to road safety here, positive and substantial progress and improvements in general road safety have been chronicled in a recent report by the OECD.  This new global report found that Ireland is now ranked the tenth safest country out of 27 countries world wide in the study.  The report looked at the road safety performance of 27 countries around the world which participate in its international safety data and analysis group in 2008.  It also examined the long-term trends in each country.  In its country report for Ireland, it reported that substantial reductions in road fatalities had been recorded.  Specifically, Ireland was the fifth most improved country out of 27 participating OECD countries in the report.  As a result, Ireland is now ranked the tenth safest country out of these 27 countries world wide, with 6.3 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The report stated there was a 17% decrease in road fatalities in 2008 compared to 2007.  Furthermore, fatalities decreased by 30% between 2005 and 2008.  Between 1970 and 2008 the number of road fatalities decreased by 48%.  In the same period, the number of vehicles on the roads quadrupled, but since 2000, the risk of being involved in a fatal collision had almost halved.  However the report also highlighted the fact that young people, especially 18 to 20 year olds, are still a high risk group in Ireland, with a fatality risk three times higher than that of the rest of the general population.  While television campaigns, driver testing and licensing, vehicle standards and promotion of road safety all go a long way towards dealing with this problem, only enforced legislation will continue to appropriately redress the current driving culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The OECD global report follows an earlier EU report published in mid 2009 by the European Transport Safety Council which has ranked Ireland the sixth safest country in the European Union.  In January of this year, the Road Safety Authority further reported that 2009 was the safest year on Ireland's roads since road deaths were first recorded in 1959.  A total of 240 people tragically lost their lives on Irish roads last year.  This is 39 fewer fatalities compared to 279 deaths in 2008 and represents an overall welcome reduction of 14%.  Furthermore, in 2009 the Government's road safety target of achieving no more than 252 deaths per annum by the end of 2012 was also achieved, three years ahead of schedule.  I agree this is considerable improvement, but the loss of even one life on our roads is one too many and no doubt we all agree on that.  It is imperative we concentrate on establishing a road safety culture that will prevent future loss of life on our nation's roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">On the issue of driving under the influence of drugs, this has been a statutory offence in Ireland since the Road Traffic Act 1961.  At present, there is no legislation or mechanism in place to allow for roadside testing of drivers for the consumption of drugs.  This is a particular challenge for gardaí in apprehending those who are guilty of being under the influence of drugs while driving.  According to the Road Safety Authority, the absence of a roadside test for drugs means that many drug-drivers will not be caught; further evidence that current legislation relating to drug-driving must change.  Up to now, gardaí have had to rely on forming an opinion that a person is under the influence of a drug before taking them to a Garda station for a blood and urine sample and unlike penalties for drink driving, there are no graded penalties based on the concentration of drugs in that person's system.  Furthermore, gardaí have had to rely on observing whether the person's driving has been impaired by the presence of a drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I am very pleased that the Bill will provide gardaí with more definite means to form an opinion that a driver is or is not under the influence of an intoxicant — whether drugs, alcohol or both.  Unfortunately, as we all know, many young people seem to drink and take drugs at the same time.  There is a necessity for a preliminary impairment test, or field impairment test, for such drivers.  This test has proven successful in its effectiveness for predicting positive drug tests for drivers, with a 64% recorded success rate.  It is another vital element of the Road Traffic Bill.  I strongly welcome this move, as it strengthens the arm of the law and enables gardaí identify and then prosecute dangerous and irresponsible drivers on our roads.  It will also go some way towards preventing drug drivers from re-offending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">Despite all the benefits contained in the Bill, many people consider that it will have negative repercussions on their businesses and lifestyles.  The Vintners' Federation of Ireland has lobbied against a plan to reduce the alcohol limit, saying it would bring about a significant number of job losses in the industry.  It would also argue that rural areas do not have an adequate level of public transport infrastructure for people who wish to visit their local pubs.  I would argue that significant funding has been provided by the Government to improve public transport in rural areas.  Some €90 million will be spent on the rural transport programme over the next four to five years.  This is welcome and we should continue to develop that programme.  Funding of €11 million was provided by the Department of Transport for the programme in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">Notwithstanding this, I realise there are elderly and disabled people in rural areas who suffer from isolation and who would like but may not be able to avail of public transport to visit their local pub.  For that reason, we need to look into alternative ways of providing evening transport for them.  This could possibly be done through the lease of school buses by local groups or perhaps local vintners could come up with a plan to provide transport for their customers.  In these economically challenging times, adapting to changing trends in Government policy as well as in the marketplace is crucial in every business.  Continuing community involvement in this regard is extremely important and should be encouraged in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">On a separate but also transport-related issue, I must take the opportunity to comment on the recent decision of Dublin City Council regarding the 30 km/h speed limit in the city centre.  That step was unnecessary and the previous limit should be restored.  From the representations and comments I am receiving, many people consider it is much more dangerous to be continually looking at the speedometer rather than watching where one is going.  I sincerely hope Dublin city councillors will have the good sense to bring about change when they review the system in July.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_1129">It may well be.  We agree that the 30 km/h speed limit is unnecessary and is doing nothing for road safety.  Analysis of the accidents occurring within the Dublin city area shows that they are limited in number.  If we are serious about increasing safety from speeding, there are other roads we should be looking at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">I offer my support for the Road Traffic Bill.  It provides for a reduction in the blood alcohol limit for drivers and revises associated penalties, including driver disqualification, while providing for mandatory alcohol testing of drivers involved in road traffic collisions.  It clarifies the minimum disqualification period that must be served before a driver may apply to the courts for the restoration of his or her licence following the imposition of a disqualification order, and it provides powers to assist the Garda in forming an opinion of whether the driver is under the influence of an intoxicant — that is, alcohol or drugs — and to carry out preliminary impairment tests.  It consolidates and restates the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts on driving while intoxicated and provides for amendments to certain fixed charge and penalty point matters.  It will improve certain provisions with regard to driving licences and provide for a number of minor amendments to the Road Traffic Acts.  These measures will have an impact on all drivers, which includes nearly every one of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I mo thuairimse tá na hathraithe seo riachtanach.  Má tá muid chun méid áirithe teorannacha a chur leis an mBille seo ar mhaithe le sabháilteacht ar ár mbóithre, tá mé go huile agus go hiomlán ag tacú leis an mBille seo agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an Teach seo mar an gcéanna.  These changes are absolutely necessary.  If we are to impose limitations while strengthening the rule of law on our roads in order to minimise the pointless, tragic and continuing loss of life around the country, then I am overwhelmingly in favour of this Bill and I trust this House will be also.</p>

          <p eId="para_1132">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1133">That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1134">National Economic and Social Forum and National Centre for Partnership and Performance Dissolution Order 2010,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1135">copies of which were laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann on 26 February 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The profoundly changed national and international context throws up challenges that must shape the way the Government conducts its business in the coming years.  Aligned to this, as Deputies will be aware, are ongoing efforts across the public service to achieve savings and avoid duplication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">The Government is keen to ensure that such decisions are made on the basis of sound, evidence-based policy.  The Government has therefore considered the future role of the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, in the context of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the recommendations of the value-for-money review of the office which was carried out last year.  These took account of the evolution of policy and programmes since the various bodies were established, not least the increase in sources of policy analysis and commentary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">In light of these considerations, the Government has decided to amalgamate the three constituent bodies of NESDO by directing that the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance be absorbed into the National Economic and Social Council.  This approach reflects the views of many of the stakeholders, including the social partners, which were consulted, as well as staff of the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Under the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006, it is possible, if the Government so decides, to create other bodies within the NESDO framework.  There is no such proposal under consideration at present, but it is prudent to leave NESDO in place as a potential shared services provider, as it will give rise to no substantive additional costs beyond those of the NESC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The NESF and the NCPP have played a valuable role over the last number of years in advising the Government on policies to achieve greater equality and social inclusion and on promoting and facilitating partnership-led change in the Irish workplace.  The excellent work of all staff involved in both of these bodies, together with the contributions made by all the social partners and Members of this House, was an integral part of the success of the two bodies and it is appropriate that we acknowledge that today.  I formally acknowledge the contribution of Ms Maureen Gaffney, chairperson of the NESF, and Mr. Peter Cassells, chairman of the NCPP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">The overall grant-in-aid allocation for NESDO in this Department's Estimate for 2010 is €3.854 million, representing a decrease of €1.205 million over the 2009 Estimate.  Work is still ongoing to finalise the transitional arrangements for the bodies and I expect that further savings will rise in future years as a result of the amalgamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">The decision to dissolve the NESF and the NCPP does not reflect any diminution of the Government's support for social dialogue, and the NESF will continue as a forum for engagement between the Government and the social partners on strategic, economic and social issues over the period ahead.  During 2010, the NESC will adapt its work programme to ensure that appropriate aspects of the work of the NESF and NCPP are continued, while also focusing on economic and social aspects of the ongoing crisis.  The new arrangements will provide for a continued strong contribution by the social partners to the development of economic and social policy through a more streamlined structure, while also delivering substantial savings to the Exchequer.  I would welcome a strengthening of the engagement of the Oireachtas with the work of the NESC, in particular through discussion of the council's reports by the relevant committees.  I look forward to the debate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1143">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">I acknowledge the work carried out by these bodies over the last number of years.  There is no doubt they have played a valuable role, as the Minister of State said.  Over the last few months, Fine Gael has called for the rationalisation of many quangos, which is a word that can be used to describe some of the bodies we are talking about this evening.  I welcome their amalgamation.  However, I would like to know what work will be carried out by these bodies in the future and what role the Government has laid out for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The Minister of State mentioned that the bodies would be more accountable to the House.  Many quangos are not answerable to the Oireachtas and cannot be questioned by its Members.  These bodies should be made accountable to the House, perhaps through parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister.  Currently, if I table a question about a body to the Department of the Taoiseach or another Department, the reply will be that the Taoiseach or Minister has no direct responsibility for the body concerned.  The Minister should be given direct responsibility for such bodies and if parliamentary questions are tabled by a Deputy, he or she should receive a direct reply.  I ask the Minister of State to forward this suggestion to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The approach over the last number of years has been to keep these bodies at arm's length.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The Minister of State spoke about value for money, which is very unusual, especially for this Government which has created a large amount of quangos.  I listened to Colm McCarthy with interest when the report of an bord snip nua was published.  He tried and failed to ascertain the amount of quangos that were in each Department.  Quangos were hiding behind other quangos and nobody knew who was responsible for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">I support this proposal.  Many more of these bodies should be amalgamated.  There is much overlap within different Departments and quangos.  There is no doubt that such bodies could be more progressive if they were brought together and given a better and more robust role.  The existing roles of quangos can be beneficial and we can highlight social advantages brought about in particular by the NESF.  There are different representative bodies on each of these boards.  The work should be continued within these bodies but there should be more of a function through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">These quangos were set up on a whim as jobs for the boys but the function of each of these bodies was lost over a number of years.  When people were appointed to these boards, it was done as a favour or to look after friends.  That is exactly what has happened over the past number of years.  I ask the Minister of State to request that these bodies have more of a responsibility to the Oireachtas; when a Member tables questions on the role, work or function of them, the relevant Minister should have direct responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">I acknowledge the work which has been done by these bodies over the past but I would like to see the duplication evident over the past eradicated.  These bodies should have a more robust role.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_612">
          <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_1150">The Government decision to abolish the NESF and the NCPP is a small but typical example of the way the public service has been mismanaged and mishandled under Fianna Fáil.  In this case an announcement was made some time ago that a public sector body, the National Economic and Social Development Office an umbrella group for the NCPP and the NESF, was to be set up.  Years were spent putting that decision into effect and now it is to be completely reorganised in order to save money.  We have a new body with plenty of staff but no clarity on its mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">Despite this, the Government initially saw no need to discuss this matter in the Dáil.  The National Economic and Social Council is a body that has existed for decades and which has played a vital role in the economic development of the State.  It has produced several reports of great significance and has provided strategic thinking to underpin the social partnership process.  This role has been crucial as it means there has been a framework of common strategic understanding on which detailed negotiations can be based.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">During the 1990s, the Labour Party was largely responsible for the establishment of the NESF, which broadened the debate between the social partners and which included Members of the Oireachtas.  Over that period, the forum has done important work, having a strong focus on social issues and in particular producing a number of important reports on the implementation of policy, not all of which were favourably disposed to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Later, in response to a growing awareness of the importance of developing partnership at workplace level, the NCPP was established.  For a number of administrative reasons it was felt necessary to establish an umbrella body for these organisations, which was NESDO.  The Bill to establish NESDO meandered through the Oireachtas for years and was never a priority matter.  It was on the Order Paper for an interminable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">Two of the bodies under the NESDO are to be abolished following a recommendation of the McCarthy report.  After years of legislating for an umbrella body, it will only have one entity to shelter.  At the same time the entity has no defined mission.  The NESC has a mission defined in the NESDO legislation, as did the forum and the centre.  We are told that some of the functions of the centre and the forum are to be continued by the NESC, although we are not told which functions they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">How will any of this work?  Will the NESC, for example, take on the role of researching the implementation of policy?  Can it do so effectively when there are five Secretaries General on the NESC council?  Does this not automatically neuter the possibility of robust criticism of policy implementation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">What of the NCPP?  It may be beneficial to have the expertise of the NCPP staff available to the NESC.  One of the areas in which social partnership has seen most difficulty in recent years has been workplace rights and industrial relations.  Bringing that pool of expertise into the NESC may be useful but we do not have clarity on how the NESC mandate, which is set out in legislation, and the NESC working model is to be adapted to take account of these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">We are getting a new model based on a short-term cost-saving measure rather than starting with the question of what we need and building an organisation to meet that requirement.  This is a small example but it reflects a broader problem in Government in the whole approach to public service reform.  The emphasis has been on the short term rather than a planned and calibrated approach to rein in the excessive costs created by Government in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The big question underlying all of this is the future of social partnership.  The same short-term approach has effectively put social partnership into suspended animation.  As a country, we need a determination to move forward together, and we need a system of social dialogue to help us achieve this.  It will be a different system to the social partnership model that went before and instead of getting ideas from the Government and positive proposals on how to reform and remake social dialogue, we are getting a half-baked measure that will save some money but which leaves many important questions unanswered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">This is an opportunity to describe to the House what has happened with quangos over the past ten to 15 years.  Some 205 quangos have been established and every one took authority from this House and the Members of the House who were elected by the people.  In effect, we took authority from the people which we were given as Members of this House.  It is outrageous that this happened.  It occurred in a Pontius Pilate manner to wash Ministers' hands of responsibility for decisions which had to be made, particularly difficult decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">We are now in a position with all of these quangos fully funded with public money but we cannot even raise a question in this House about them.  Ministers apparently have no responsibility for them.  There is a general broad brush in that the Minister has a responsibility for policy and can in that sense control the quangos but it is not true in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">Each one of these quangos has a chairman, a chief executive officer, a board and hires spin doctors to tell us the great actions they are taking, producing fancy and expensive magazines to tell us what they are at.  I would like to see an Act of Parliament to bring every one of these under the control of this House until we get around to abolishing about half of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_613">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1162">The Sinn Féin members do not agree to this motion seeking our approval for the dissolution of the National Economic and Social Forum.  We are not particularly concerned with the dissolution of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">This motion arises from the McCarthy report.  We have no difficulty with the statement in that report that there is duplication among overlapping agencies, including the National Economic and Social Development Office, the National Economic and Social Council, the NESF and the NCCP.  However, as the McCarthy report itself points out, the NESF's mission is to provide advice to Government about policies to achieve greater social inclusion and equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">In our view the NESF, because of its remit to achieve greater social inclusion and equity, is the one body among these bodies that should be retained.  This Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government has already abolished the Combat Poverty Agency at a time when Government policy is driving more people into poverty.  Over the years, the NESF has produced many reports that have proved embarrassing for the Government because the focus of those reports was about ensuring equity of access for all to quality public services and the need to combat social exclusion.  Elements of many of the reports have also been included in Government policy.  The forum was one of the more inclusive bodies involved in the social partnership process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">I could cite many reports that have never been implemented, but are still totally relevant.  I made a brief mention of three of them today during the Order of Business.  The 2002 NESF report on equity in acute hospital care exposed the grossly inequitable two-tier nature of our health system.  The report stated that the two-tier system was inequitable in practice and that additional health service funding was not enough, because major structural reform was needed.   The report asserted that consideration of alternative models from countries without equity problems should be the highest priority.  The NESF report stated that the State should be a guarantor of access for all, regardless of means.  This is the only way to achieve equity of access to acute care. Therefore, entitlement — as opposed to eligibility — is the most appropriate frame for health policy.  Health care entitlements should be codified in legislation.  Those were the key points made by the NESF.  If this motion is passed, the NESF will be gone but the gross inequalities and inefficiencies in our health services will still be with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">In 2005, an NESF report exposed the massive deficit in child care in this State.  It has taken the Government five years to act on the key recommendation of that report, which was for State-funded early childhood care and education for all children in the year before they go to school.  Unfortunately, the Government's implementation of this is flawed and has created an age gap which is currently excluding thousands of children born in July and August 2007, something that is replicated each year.  The latest NESF report was published last October on the home care package scheme, and it stated that the scheme is being stymied by bad implementation on the part of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">The body which completed all this valuable work — there are many other reports to which I could refer and from which I drew over the years as a Member of this House — is being abolished and nothing will be put in its place.  It seems that the Government is killing off the watchdogs one by one.  Quite frankly, we are not at all in favour of this approach, so we will oppose the motion.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1168">I thank Members for their contributions.  Those who have spoken have either been members or clients of the service provided by the National Economic and Social Forum, so I understand where they are coming from.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">Deputy Kehoe raised the issue of accountability to the Dáil.  Under Taoiseach's questions, all of those bodies are accountable to the Dáil and that will continue.  Reports that are laid before the House will be routinely debated.  I would like to see more regular debates on the various policy initiatives both here and in the other Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">To answer the question raised by Deputy Stagg, the NESC will continue the research, analytical and evaluation work delivered by the NESF.  The publication of their reports not only assists policy formation, but informs public debate, including consideration by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas of issues and proposals arising.  Any reports produced by the NESC shall be laid before the Houses and published.  The Government will welcome a greater engagement by the Oireachtas with the work of the NESC, through discussion of its reports by the relevant committees and by the House itself.  This is the most appropriate way for Members to contribute to these issues, as they do with many other advisory bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">The transition process is under way to ensure the amalgamation of the NESF and the NCPP into the NESC and to ensure that the process is managed carefully.  This will adapt the NESC work programme and methods as necessary.  The NESDO will remain a structure which the Government can use to establish new bodies if required, at no extra cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">A query was raised about the fact that five Secretaries General were on the NESC, but there were five on the NESF already, yet that did not restrict debate very much.</p>

          <p eId="para_1174">Deputy Ó Caoláin is entitled to his view on what the Government is doing.  I fundamentally disagree that there is an intention by the Government to close off any organisation that is providing worthwhile analyses of policy and is providing directions for policy.  I was a member of the team that produced the child care report, as mentioned by the Deputy.  It was an all-party report, and everybody on the group agreed with the approach.  It was not completely taken on board, but the child care policy that was outlined is being implemented in stages.  In due course, the child care programme to be made available to young children will be as good as that in any other country.  This programme is being developed using the policy documents drawn up by the NESF.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">I ask that Members reflect on this decision.  It is well thought through.  There is no intention at all to restrict the availability of analysis to Members of this House, to members of the public or to other policy groups throughout the country.  There is still a mix of expertise and interests on the groups which heretofore had been present.  On that basis, I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1272">I thank Deputy Timmins for tabling the Bill.  I am sure he has already stated that we are all suffering from a little <i>déjà vu</i> as this is the second time the Bill has been brought before the House.  On the first occasion, the Minister who dealt with it was Michael McDowell who was treated with complete derision.  I read the transcript of that debate and the comments of the former Minister were typical of the man in so far as he dismissed with a degree of arrogance any notion that people engaged in providing assistance to those in distress would need any form of protection.  At the time, we made a case, which I continue to make, for such protection with regard to volunteerism or stopping to assist someone in distress from a car accident, a heart attack or some such misadventure, which are what first comes to mind when one thinks about it, but it is not about such situations only.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Recently, an individual was stabbed to death after going to the assistance of his neighbours during a row.  I am not certain whether this good Samaritan legislation would have been any help to the individual involved but this event was not as unique or as unusual as we may imagine.  In Ireland, our first instinct is to assist someone in a time of need.  That time of need may very well involve domestic violence, a parent being over-exuberant in chastising a child, a car crash, a heart attack or any such issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">Now that the recession has hit so badly and people have far more time on their hands we will probably return to the type of community we had in the past.  That was a very giving community which was only too willing to go to the assistance of people who found themselves in distress.  However, people in our society have become extraordinarily well-versed in what are their rights and whether they have a right to sue in the event of someone not being careful enough in rendering assistance.  We need to ensure those rendering assistance are protected from litigation when all they wished to do was give assistance to someone in his or her hour of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">To contribute to the debate I did some research, and the natural situations that spring to mind involve someone who has had a heart attack or who has been involved in an accident.  However, these are not the only situations involved.  I came across information on a group of people who stood back while someone was being mugged and gave no assistance; they did not even telephone the Garda Síochána.  This also comes under the legislation.  We need to protect a person who intervenes in such a situation.  We need the State to acknowledge that a person gave assistance in a good Samaritan fashion and that he or she is covered and cannot be sued because of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">People get involved in areas they should not.  In Italy, all a person is expected to do is to call an ambulance or the police; one is not expected to get involved no matter what the circumstances.  That is not a bad policy.  People jump in to give medical assistance and no doubt they feel they have the competence to assist people.  I would not do so; I would not feel competent enough to do so.  However, some people have the capacity to help people in the case of accident or serious illness, such as care workers, off-duty nurses or doctors.  Assistance is provided regularly as fortunately in this county we intervene and come to people's assistance.  However, it is only a matter of time before a person decides he or she would have been better off if that person had not intervened and sues him or her.  Word spreads very quickly and we need to protect people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">The former Taoiseach made a huge play of encouraging people to become volunteers.  The entire country was going to volunteer for something or other under his plan.  Yet there was no protection in place for those who volunteer.  We all know of cases where people in a volunteer capacity in communities, be it through a meals on wheels service or other community association, have lost their position in the voluntary organisation and have been reprimanded for going beyond what was expected of them as a volunteer, albeit that no criteria have been set down as to what that is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">We might believe that a person would never get sued for trying to help someone, but we cannot say that because people have been sued in the most peculiar fashion.  Once a person is sued, one can forget about anyone coming to a person's assistance if anything should happen.  The legislation is good but it might need tweaking.  Deputy Timmins is capable of amending the Bill.  On the previous occasion we dealt with this legislation he was very open about it.  As the legislation is not major that should be easy enough to do.  However, we should put in place a mechanism to ensure that on the one hand people will not be afraid, for fear of being sued, to intervene where a person needs help, and on the other hand if we are to encourage people to give assistance we must ensure that protections are in place.  It is not just about accidents and ill health, it is about child abuse, domestic violence and so on.  We need to ensure people who intervene with the best of intentions are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">In commending Deputy Timmins on bringing forward his Bill again I am pleased the Minister now dealing with it is not as abrasive as the previous Minister who dealt with it.  I hope the Government will do as promised and bring forward a Bill.  When Deputy Rabbitte introduced the Whistleblowers Protection Bill a number of years ago it was accepted by the Government.  Given what has transpired since, if we ever needed legislation it is that piece of legislation.  Somehow, it got sucked in by the Government.  It was referred to the select committee but it never was to see the light of day again.  I hope that will not happen in this case.  When the concept of the legislation is taken on board by the Government, I hope it will do something about it rather than it being a mechanism for stymieing a piece of legislation.  That does not help the Opposition.  Equally, those of us who have ideas about legislation are reluctant to bring them forward because if it is good enough the Government will not object to it but the Bill will then vanish.  I hope that will not happen in this instance.  We need to put protections in place on the basis that there are well-intentioned people who will come to people's aid.  We should encourage that type of action and not put up barriers to it. It is not rocket science.  It would not cost a fortune but it would ensure the State would give a degree of protection to people who like to participate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_1282">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Private Members' Bill which, as other speakers have indicated, seeks to implement recommendations brought forward by the Law Reform Commission.  The focus of the Bill is the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers.  I understand it arises out of concerns that Deputies opposite, in particular Deputy Timmins, raised on a previous occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">The necessity to put in place this type of legislation is widely recognised. The only difference between any of us tonight is the extent to which the necessary protections are put in place.  While I would prefer the Bill to have been enacted much more quickly, it is important to ensure we get it right and that we do not leave gaps in the legislation that will add to or create a greater level of difficulty for those who might find themselves on the receiving end of a law suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">It is sad that such legislation has to be enacted.  Society has moved to a more litigious stage of development.  We appear to be following the trend that was established in the United States of being overly litigious, what is often referred to as an ambulance-chasing culture.  Some of that is driven by the legal fraternity and it is also driven by those who seek to gain financially from whatever situation at any opportunity.  Such acts are deplorable but they happen and protection is required, especially for all of us whose natural instinct is to reach out to assist someone who has been involved in an accident or emergency.  As Deputy Kathleen Lynch indicated, there are other instances in which people find themselves in a perilous state and in need of assistance from others.  It should be the case that people are free to give of their time, assistance and skills in such a way that they do not have to second-guess what might be the outcome for them from the point of view of having to face the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">It is also important that the legislation would be clear on the position of a professional such as a doctor or nurse who offers assistance while off-duty and that protection would be provided for them when their professional indemnity insurance would not come into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">We must ensure protection is provided to voluntary groups such as the GAA and soccer clubs.  We are all well aware of the tremendous efforts made by members of such community groups.  In County Clare various groups such as GAA clubs, soccer clubs and scout groups assisted during the flooding crisis and the severe frost we had after Christmas.  They operated mechanical equipment and assisted people who were in difficult circumstances.  We need to ensure the legislation that is produced provides protection for them.  It would be too much to expect that such groups would have to put in place insurance for those voluntary acts that fall outside their terms of reference or the codes to which they normally ascribe.  Where a group of volunteers comes together to respond to a mini-disaster or crisis that includes members of the local GAA club or community group, the association of which they are a member should not incur liability for anything that might arise.  We must clarify all these issues regarding the provision of services that are primarily for the assistance of others and, in so far as possible, remove the potential for liability attaching to the corporate bodies such as the Garda Síochána or other arms of the State.  I hope these issues will be taken into account when the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is published in this session.  It is important to have clarity in these matters.</p>

The Attorney General's request to the commission arose against the background of an earlier Private Members' Bill, the Good Samaritan Bill 2005, which was defeated on the basis that there was a dearth of Irish law on good samaritans and that any proposal to legislate in this area would require careful consideration.  We are all pleased that the Government's legislative programme, published by the Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey in January, indicates that the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be published in the current year.  I understand drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and that it will include provision for the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers through the implementation of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations in its 2009 report.  Therefore, while the principle of the Private Members' Bill is accepted by the Government, as indicated by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, last night, substantial progress has been already made in the drafting of the Government Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Various Members spoke about the importance of volunteerism.  I was involved in an incident last year which I have thought about every day since it happened.  On Monday night, 20 April 2009, as I left my office in Tallaght and walked towards my car, I became aware of a commotion close by.  A young man named Gareth Farrell — I mention his name because I think about him every day — had just been involved in a motorcycle accident and by the time I reached him he was dead.  I mention this incident because two people who were ahead of me on the path were already leaning down to kneel beside him.  Without any fear or concern for the consequences, they sought to administer to and assist him in any way they could, but it soon became apparent that he was dead.  I will never forget that experience and it has come to mind even more prominently in the context of this debate.  If those people had paused to consider the possible consequences of any intervention, they might not have sought to assist the victim.  It was to their credit that they were willing to offer their help without fear or hesitation.  It is important that anybody in that type of situation should feel free to intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">Deputy Dooley referred to the importance of defibrillators.  Members may be aware that I suffered a heart attack ten years ago.  It happened at a Frances Black concert in the Civic Theatre in Tallaght.  Several people came to my aid on that occasion when they could easily have decided to leave me be.  Perhaps Deputy Timmins is thinking that a few people would not be at all upset if something terrible happened to Charlie O'Connor.</p>

          <p eId="para_1297">Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Dooley spoke eloquently about volunteerism, which is something that was very much a part of my background.  One of the consequences of the Celtic tiger years was a decline in volunteerism not only because people were too busy but because of concern and fear arising from the talk of various court cases and so on.  It is important that we promote volunteerism and ensure there is adequate protection for volunteers.  I hope the Government Bill will take account of all that.  I urge my Fine Gael colleagues to be patient.  They have done a good job and I am sure the Minister will take on board their efforts in bringing forward the Government legislation.  I look forward to supporting that legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_628">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1298">It is not often that there is broad agreement on all sides of the House regarding the merits of draft legislation.  However, this is a good example of the generally impressive publications brought forward by the Law Reform Commission.  I am pleased Fine Gael took the opportunity to replicate the draft Bill provided by the commission as an appendix to its report.  I compliment Deputy Timmins on bringing forward the legislation because these types of reports tend to gather dust.  Legislation in this area will allow people to breathe more easily, from members of football teams to volunteers in various organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">The Fine Gael proposal seeks to implement the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's report on the civil liability of good samaritans, which was published last year.  The Bill purports to protect from liability those who go to the assistance of others who may be ill or injured as a result of an accident or other emergency.  The intention is to ensure that those who intervene to give help to others and who offer this assistance in good faith cannot then be penalised or held liable as a result of their intervention provided they are not grossly negligent.  The Bill also provides for the liability of voluntary organisations and undertakings for the ordinary negligence of their members.  All of that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">The report of the Law Reform Commission was undertaken in response to a request in January 2006 by the Attorney General to make such recommendations as the commission considered appropriate for reform of the law on civil liability in this area.  The Attorney General's request arose against the background of an earlier Private Members' proposal, the Good Samaritan Bill 2005.  That Bill was defeated on the basis that there was a dearth of Irish law on good samaritans and that any proposal to legislate in this area would require careful consideration.  The lesson in all of this is that while the wheels of the law may move slowly, they have been speeded up in this case as evidenced by the commitment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward the legislation as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">The Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, has indicated that the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which will make provision for the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers, will be published in the current session and enacted within a shorter than usual timeframe.  I understand drafting is at an advanced stage.  This Bill will implement the Law Reform Commission's recommendations  and provide more adequately for the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers than what is envisaged in the Private Members' Bill.  That is one of the lessons of being in government.  I recall from my five years in opposition that one might draft a Bill which made an abundance of sense.  However, one is essentially producing only the heads of a Bill, without the nuts and bolts of the detail.  On this side of the fence one realises the importance of getting the detail right and working closely with the Attorney General and with Departments to make sure every i is dotted and t crossed.  That is often the reason legislation can take a long time to come on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">The Government Bill will provide the requisite statutory framework and will ensure there is no general duty on any category of persons to attempt to rescue or assist an at risk or injured person.  There will be a statutory definition of good samaritans and volunteers as those who act voluntarily and without expectation of payment or other reward in providing assistance, advice or care in emergency situations or for the benefit of the community.  In a sense, this pertains to the antithesis to what Robert Putnam described as bowling alone.  It is about the essence of community, about people helping one another and about meitheal.  It is about something the Irish always have been good at but it will enshrine this in law.  It is counter-intuitive to tell someone not to go near a person who is in difficulty but to hold back and wait for the gardaí or the ambulance to arrive.  This goes against our very nature and against the grain of what being Irish is all about and this Bill will make it easier for us to go to the assistance of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Moreover, it will provide a standard of care for good samaritans and volunteers, which only imposes liabilities in circumstances of gross negligence, the test for which will be set out in the legislation.  It will provide a standard of care for volunteer organisations or undertakings which impose liability in circumstances of ordinary negligence.  In addition, it will ensure that account should be taken of the benefits which have accrued to society because of a voluntary organisation's work when determining whether it is just and reasonable to impose liability.  One hears much talk around this House on encouraging volunteerism and encouraging people to help others.  The Bill proposed by Fine Gael and, more importantly, the Bill the Government is in the process of bringing forward, will address these issues adequately.  It will constitute a good step forward for a common law society like Ireland and for the people.  The law often has intervened and in a funny old way and this will move us towards the European model, in which one does reach out to others and in which there is an expectation that people can and should help out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_629">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_1304">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Civil Liability (Good Samaritans and Volunteers) Bill.  The initiative shown by the Opposition and by Deputy Timmins in particular must be recognised.  I also am aware that Deputy Carey has a great interest in this Bill and the initiative shown in this regard is appreciated.  However, as indicated by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Government is in the final stages of preparing its own legislation, which I believe will address the matter a little more efficiently.  It is vital that legislation on this matter be drafted cautiously, which is what the Government is in the process of doing at present.  It is of paramount importance that an individual who goes to the aid of another who is hurt or experiencing an emergency and who does so with good intentions should not be concerned with the possibility of being sued as a result of his or her intervention.  Members have recounted different stories and all are familiar with examples from their own experiences in which they personally have been involved.  Many members of society go to the aid of individuals and while it probably is the last thing on their minds, Members should do everything they can to protect them.  I am glad this initiative has been made and that the Minister is keen to move on with legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Active citizenship must be promoted now more than ever, given the nation's economic instability.  Active citizenship was a given in Ireland in the past in communities in which everyone helped one another out, everyone knew one another and looked out for one another.  Unfortunately however, we have grown to become much more independent as individuals and while this is a good thing to some degree, I believe it is time to revive the element of looking out for one another.  I grew up in a rural constituency in County Donegal in which it certainly was the case that everyone in the local community knew everyone else.  Moreover, times were very different and people were not in the same rush as today.  Times have changed and people's approach to one another consequently also has changed and this should be reconsidered.  I believe the pace of life is too fast at present for the good of people's health.  While I certainly welcome all the technological advances and so on, human beings can only take so much and people appear to be running from pillar to post.  Nearly everyone in society today has an extremely busy life, which certainly was not the case when I was growing up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">There is a very real threat to volunteerism due to civil liability uncertainty.  There also is the added worry that insurance premiums may increase for volunteer groups.  As public representatives, all Members are informed about the good work done by voluntary groups and about the damage that increased insurance costs would cause to them.  It is evident that clarity in law in respect of civil liability is required and this issue was raised by Deputy Timmins as long ago as 2005.  It was referred to the Law Reform Commission in 2006 due to various concerns about the original Bill.  The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and will incorporate them into the proposed civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is in the course of being drafted for publication during this Dáil session.  I welcome this step and hope it meets the approval of Deputy Timmins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Various issues have arisen that require further attention to ensure this matter is addressed appropriately, which is not the case in respect of this Private Members' Bill.  The Bill envisaged by the Government will contain additional safeguards in respect of civil liability to ensure anyone in need is not deprived of assistance due to fear of liability.  It is intended that there will be no general duty on any category of persons to attempt to assist or support another person at risk or in need of aid.  A statutory definition of volunteers also will be determined as those who act voluntarily and without expectation of payment or other reward in providing assistance in emergency situations or for the benefit of others.  In order to encourage volunteerism and active citizenship, which I believe to be vital at present, the Government Bill will provide a statutory framework for the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers to provide clarity and reassurance on the common law position.  It also will provide a standard of care for good samaritans and volunteers, which only will impose liability in the case of gross negligence, the test for which will be set out.  Furthermore, it will provide a standard of care for voluntary organisations or undertakings, which will impose liability in circumstances of ordinary negligence.  Perhaps most importantly, it will ensure that account should be taken of the benefits which have accrued to society because of a voluntary organisation's work in determining whether it is just and reasonable to impose liability.  I welcome the input of Opposition Members on this matter and look forward to issues in respect of volunteerism and civil liability being clarified and addressed appropriately through the Minister's Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1308">I also welcome the opportunity to contribute.  At the outset, I commend Deputies Timmins and Charles Flanagan on the work they have done and on their genuine intentions in bringing this Bill before the House.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, set out last night, the Government is in the process of preparing legislation which will be brought to finality shortly.  I agree with the Minister's proposal to defer the Second Reading of the Bill for six months.  As Deputy Blaney mentioned a few minutes ago, Members will remember growing up with the concept and practice of being a good neighbour, whereby a good samaritan was someone who helped out when one was in need or in a difficult position.  However, with the advent of the Celtic tiger, this practice changed.  In some respects, this may have been due to litigation or the fear of getting involved but it also was due to the fact that people were leading busy lives.  Many people felt they had enough to do to mind their own business without minding or becoming involved in anyone else's business.   Members will be familiar with the nosy neighbour, that is, the person who cannot mind his or her own business or stay out of other people's affairs.  At a recent meeting of Castleblayney joint policing committee, I touched on this matter and recommended that people needed to revert to looking out for one another.  I suggested that if something happened or if something suspicious was happening in an area, people had a duty to look out for another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">I welcome the Minister's statement that those who act with good intentions and go to the assistance of someone who is injured, ill, experiencing an emergency or in danger need not fear the threat of being sued for doing a good deed.  I also welcome his statement that this situation would be set out in the Government's legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">Many Deputies this evening discussed volunteerism.  It is important that we return to basics and that our young people begin to see and appreciate the value of and need for volunteerism.  Thankfully, this country has a proud tradition in that regard.  More than 500,000 people volunteer their services.  They willingly give of their time and energy, make a considerable contribution to society and expect no monetary compensation in return.  For them, the satisfaction comes from helping those who are less fortunate than themselves and community-based organisations in their areas.  We all know of the dedicated people who train football teams, head youth groups and organise music or dancing lessons, community games, active retirement, meals on wheels, etc.  The list is endless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">What happens if there is an incident and no qualified medical personnel are available?  The person who is required to give assistance at the time must be protected.  Our community is much richer thanks to such people and our children benefit from the experience, but a greater degree of legal certainty is necessary.  The last thing anyone wants to do is discourage volunteerism or cause increases in the insurance premia of volunteer groups.  The volunteer must be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">I welcome the Minister's comments regarding damage to property.  In many situations, such damage is or could be a natural consequence of assisting someone in need.  For example, if a neighbour is worried about someone who has not appeared in the local community for a number of days, he or she might break into the person's house to provide vital assistance before the emergency services arrive.  If one encounters a car accident, one might need to damage the car to free someone.  We do not want people to become paranoid about what might occur if they go to someone's assistance.  Time might not always be available, so one would not be able to afford to delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">I agree that the issue is complex and that every scenario must be examined and covered.  In recent times, people have become litigious.  This is unfortunate for society, in that the lure of the euro and however many zeros follow it in an insurance claim are uppermost in some people's minds.  In September, I visited a friend whose son had brought home from school a personal insurance claim proposal form that he was to fill in.  He asked me how much he would get if he broke his arm.  Even at an early age he was considering the money he might get from such an accident.  It is a mindset that we need to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Legislation is required.  I am of the opinion that rushed legislation is not always good legislation.  It is important that it be done properly and that we take everything into consideration.  I agree with the manner in which the Minister is proceeding, namely, taking on board the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, and incorporating the principles of its draft Bill into another Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">I thank Deputies for their input and for giving us an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1317">I will share time with those Deputies.  The need to introduce such a Bill as the one before us this evening dates back to 2003 when publicly available defibrillators first came on-stream.  Following research and consultation, my colleague, Deputy Billy Timmins, introduced the first Good Samaritan Bill in 2005.  Tonight, I commend him for continuing to raise this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">The new Bill in the names of Deputies Timmins and Charles Flanagan gives protections to the nationwide movement by people to take in charge their own ability to discharge help towards those who might have suffered cardiac arrest in their communities.  This movement manifested itself in the many sporting organisations and community associations that purchased defibrillation equipment.  In turn, this created networks of volunteers selflessly making themselves available if something occurs in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">I applaud Deputy Timmins's tenacity on this issue.  I have no doubt that, until Fine Gael's Private Members' business was published last Friday, the Minister had little intention of proceeding with the LRC's recommendations, which were consequential to Deputy Timmins's work in 2005.  Listening to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating yesterday that he was going to enact the legislation in conjunction with the granting of a liquor licence to the national conference centre was peculiar.  If he really wanted to expedite the passage of this legislation, he could tack it onto the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 or whatever else might be knocking around the Cabinet table in the next couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">In the Gospel of St. Luke, Jesus tells the parable of the good Samaritan.  In it, a Jewish traveller is beaten, robbed and left half dead on the roadside.  First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man.  Finally, a Samaritan comes by and helps the man.  Today, one could assign the roles of priest and Levite to the former and current Ministers, Michael McDowell and Deputy Dermot Ahern, respectively.  Both have chosen to pass by and ignore the concerns of those who act in good faith on behalf of their neighbours in times of need.</p>

          <p eId="para_1322">The nature of volunteerism has changed.  The minute any organisation interacts with State agencies such as, for example, FÁS, Pobal or the HSE to provide employment through community employment schemes, provide child care through the national child care investment programme or develop infrastructure in its community, it is immediately entering a bureaucratic nightmare and the imposition of standards that the State itself does not always follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">The recent bad weather saw the principles of volunteerism and the good samaritan in operation.  Communities and individuals took care of their own.  This was widespread in my county of Clare, where neighbours, sporting organisations and community groups worked hand in hand to help one another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">The LRC's analysis of this issue was that it is unlikely that liability would arise in most situations.  However, it qualified its conclusion to the effect that a residual risk of litigation could not be ruled out, particularly in the context of organised volunteering activity.  It is critical that the Minister no longer puts this issue on the long finger.  He has an opportunity tonight to do something positive on behalf of the many people who take up the slack when the State is either unwilling or unable to do so.  I appeal to the Government to have a change of heart and support this progressive Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1325">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I compliment Deputy Timmins on his persistence in respect of this issue.  He first tabled a Bill some five years ago and, with Deputy Charles Flanagan, he is sponsoring this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">From some of the contributions, one would believe that the Bill had been plucked out of the sky.  As we know, the LRC was asked by the Government to consider the issue.  The LRC conducted a detailed analysis, made a preliminary report, sought submissions on it and arrived at a final document and draft legislation, which Deputy Timmins has sponsored on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I was very disappointed by the response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night.  I believed he was big enough to accept the legislation proposed by the Opposition.  Instead, he has decided to long-finger the detailed  recommendations of the independent Law Reform Commission, which are based on a report which was requested by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">I hope the political commentators who call for a government of national unity will note the way the Government has treated this legislation, which every citizen and Member of the Dáil supports and which has been proposed by an independent commission of eminent lawyers and judges.  The Government has turned its back on those recommendations.  How can we expect the Government to work constructively with the Opposition and take our views on board when such a politically partisan approach is taken to the report of the Law Reform Commission?  It is clear that the Government is not prepared to listen to constructive suggestions or proposals put forward by the Opposition.  How can we expect the Government to consider proposals from this side of the House on complex issues of economic recovery when something as straightforward as this legislation is sidelined, purely because it is proposed by the Opposition?  The Government says it wants to see the colour of our money and hear how we would right the economy, purely in order to ridicule the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">In the media, we see calls for electoral reform.  One way to reform this House would be to give the Members a direct role in drafting and enacting legislation.  We need political reform but, sadly, the Government is not big enough or open-minded enough to provide for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">I compliment the Law Reform Commission on its detailed analysis and I thank it for keeping me up to date on the commission's progress on this legislation.  Last night, a constituent of mine, Ms Eunice Langley, was in the Gallery.  Through the Defibrillator Access and Resuscitation Association, DARA, she has trained more than 2,500 people in the use of defibrillators.  She left the House last night, disgusted at the Minister's response to the Bill.  Ms Langley cannot be here tonight because she is training another community in County Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The purpose of this legislation is to protect those who come to the assistance of people who are involved in an accident or emergency.  This is close to my own heart because a number of years ago, when my father was killed in a road traffic accident, the driver of his car would have died at the scene of the accident if a GP had not arrived and treated him at the location.  The accident occurred only six miles from Portiuncula Hospital but he would not have survived the journey.  He owed his life to that doctor.  There are thousands of such individuals throughout the country who put their own lives at stake on a daily basis.  They do not consider the issue of liability or insurance.  The Government is turning its back on them by the decision to long-finger this legislation.  Shame on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1331">Four or five years ago, when this proposal came before the House, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, poured scorn on the Bill, on the basis that it was not filtered, researched or this, that or the other.  I congratulate Deputy Billy Timmins because without him the Bill would not have reached the floor of the House a second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">This morning, during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach castigated the Opposition for not being helpful.  One could not say this Bill is as important as the NAMA legislation but it is a very important Bill.  The Government is presented with an opportunity, cleared by the Law Reform Commission and by everyone I have come across throughout the country.  Is it not unbelievable that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sees fit, even after all this filtering and research, to kick the Bill into touch for another six or 12 months?  If he brings a Bill to the House after that time, it will contain the same measures and will have the same psychology behind it.  Everyone in the country knows that the Civil Liability (Good Samaritans and Volunteers) Bill deals with what we all understand a good samaritan to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">I cannot understand how small-minded the members of the Government are.  Even after the filtering process of which I spoke, they cannot see fit to accept the Bill.  I hope commentators will hear what is happening tonight.  For purely political reasons — or what I would call bad blood, which is the opposite of being a good samaritan — they cannot see it in their hearts to accept something from the Opposition, even if it is outstandingly acceptable to everyone in the country.  A great number of people will see through the Government charade of criticising the Opposition for not playing its part in getting the economy right.  The Government may forget about Dáil reform.  They do not have a clue about it.  It means something different to Fianna Fáil than to anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">I am a fair while in this House and I have seen great attitudinal changes.  There is a certain element in Irish society who keep a stiff upper lip.  They hear no evil and see no evil.  These people have come to a stage in their lives where they have decided to mind their own business.  I accept that many of us do not like to see anyone meddling in our business.  I am talking about helping others for the greater good of families and individuals.  Minding one's own business has gone too far.  I grew up when the meitheal concept was common.  If a neighbour was in trouble, everyone would deem it their duty to help in their hour of need.  That is what the good samaritan Bill is about.  No matter how one dresses it up, it is to allow us to come to the aid of someone who is in serious trouble without fear of having to walk the plank of legislation as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">I am afraid Deputy Timmins, despite the great trouble he has taken, will have to bring the Bill onto the floor of the House again because the Government will not accept it.  As more people learn why the Bill was not accepted the Government will appear in a very poor light.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1336">I am very disappointed the Government did not take on board the very worthy objective of this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Timmins on introducing it twice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">The two issues of volunteerism and litigation are brought together in the Bill.  There is a fantastic history of volunteerism in this country.  As a rural person, I remember Muintir na Tíre.  When we did not have water in our houses Muintir na Tíre came together to put in a group rural water scheme.  Volunteerism developed from that through sporting organisations, community councils and the various non-governmental organisations which involved themselves in necessary work, with no monetary reward but great psychological reward for what they do.  That is one side of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">The other side is the whole area of litigation.  We have become a very litigious society and it is unfortunate that has happened.  Since the onset of the recession, we are moving away from that and back towards volunteerism which should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Some years ago I was in Kerry when somebody dived into a swimming pool and hit their head at the bottom of the pool and was injured.  There were nurses around but they did not help that person immediately.  They waited for some time to see if the person was all right because they were afraid of what would happen if things went wrong for them.  This Bill will change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">We must encourage more volunteerism and protect those who volunteer to assist in their communities and assist people in difficulties such as in an accident, in an emergency or otherwise, whether on the sports field, on the roads or elsewhere.  This Bill facilitates and encourages that and sends a message to the people that the Government and the Opposition encourage them to intervene to help people in crisis and that there will be no fallout.  People believe there will be fallout because of our litigious society and the way this is treated in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The issue of defibrillators is a perfect example where somebody takes the risk of intervening where a person is close to death.  If the person dies, that intervention may be interpreted as contributing to the demise of that person.  One can understand the reluctance of people to intervene.  Deputy Timmins seeks to ensure that people in need of such assistance get the maximum opportunity to survive through the intervention of their fellow citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">It is very disappointing the Government is not in favour of the Bill, although it stated it is in favour of its objectives.  The Law Reform Commission has said this is the way to go.  Why is the Government not in favour of what its organisation, our organisation and the Law Reform Commission have said is the way forward?</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The good samaritan issue is not one which people are widely discussing, because it is not tangible.  However, there is a resistance to intervene to help people to survive, to reduce danger and to overcome difficulties being experienced, whether on a sports field, on the roads or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">I entreat the Minister and the Government to look seriously at what Deputy Timmins has proposed and to send a message to the people that volunteers will be protected from litigation and the unfortunate circumstances which people believe could arise.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_638">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1345">I commend my colleague, Deputy Timmins, on bringing forward this Bill.  Most speakers have outlined how cynical the public will become if Bills, which make perfect sense, are not adopted and if we do not get around to conducting our business in a more sensible manner without playing politics all the time.  The Government amendment agrees with everything in the Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, is a reasonable and progressive person who perhaps must agree with the party line on this.  However, it makes no sense not to adopt this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Without volunteerism, nothing would happen.  The value for money volunteers provide across a whole spectrum, whether the tidy towns, meals on wheels, cemetery committees etc., cannot be quantified.  In most cases, people have public liability insurance and cover against any damage done to property etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">This Bill specifically provides for those who go to the aid of people.  Approximately seven years ago, Deputy Timmins and I were approached by a couple of people in County Wicklow who asked us to look into commencing a community first responders initiative.  The then East Coast Area Health Board, which was responsible for the ambulance service, gave its time freely, sorted out all the issues around training and evaluation and trained the people.  People whose cars were insured got clearance from their insurance companies if they had a full licence to go to a call out at any stage.  It was not seen as doing something for hire, it did not change the status of the cover and there was no extra premium.  People bought into the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">Underlying that, there is a fear that somebody who goes in good faith to the aid of a person to offer medical assistance or to rescue him or her will be held liable if something goes wrong.  The Bill is about absolving a person of that.  Nobody goes through the evaluation system with the intention of going out to do somebody harm.  This Bill gives people some reassurance that they will not be held liable and that litigation cannot be taken against them in a culture which has become litigious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">During the bad weather crisis, people were prohibited from helping others because of insurance and public liability issues.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has indicated that he intends to change the law in regard to people clearing their footpaths, for instance, which is a progressive step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">I cannot understand why this Bill must be delayed until next September to be adopted.  It smacks of the politicisation of a common sense issue.  It makes no sense to the public, the Opposition and to most Members on the Government side.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_639">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_1351">Good samaritan laws or Acts protect from liability those who choose to aid others who are injured or ill.  They are intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">In Canada, a good samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing.  Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions if they were to make some mistake in treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">Good samaritan laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as will their interactions with various other legal principles, such as consent, parental rights and the right to refuse treatment.  Such laws generally do not apply to medical professionals' or career emergency responders' on the job conduct but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity.  While US laws focus on shielding from liability those who choose to help in a situation they did not cause, European laws criminalise failure to help in such a situation.  In Europe, people who do not help are convicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">During the recent cold spell, I spoke to the director of transport in Wexford County Council.  An offer to help grit the county roads was made by the farming community who had machinery capable of spreading the grit, more capable than that of the local authority.  The director of transport was concerned, however, that for health and safety reasons he would have to leave the roads in a dangerous and unsafe condition.  At some stage, someone will have to shout "Stop".  Farmers were informed that the local authority would provide grit and that they could act in the common good by gritting the roads but that they would be open to prosecution if something went wrong.  The law, as it stands, does not provide legal protection should an accident occur in such circumstances.  At the start of the second decade of the 21st century, it is madness that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, worked into the Charities Bill positive amendments tabled by this side of the House and thereby improved the legislation.  I am at a loss to understand the reason the Government has decided not to accept this Bill, as we do not want similar legislation to be introduced in six months or six years.  In October 2007, when the Labour Party introduced the Civil Partnership Bill, the Government indicated it would produce its own Bill.  It failed to do so for a further two and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">As I stated, the Minister of State is a positive member of the Government.  Perhaps he will be promoted in the coming weeks, in which case I will extend my best wishes to him.  However, having observed the operation of the Oireachtas since my election in the summer of 2007, I do not believe the House is fit for purpose.  Its mode of operation dates from an earlier era and is a legacy of the early years of independence.  For the life of me, I cannot understand the reason only three Private Members' Bills have been enacted in the past 30 years.  While I accept that criticism can be levelled at the Fine Gael Party in government on that score, the Fianna Fáil Party has been in government for four out of every five years since independence.  Since the establishment of the Dáil in 1919, approximately 30 Private Members' Bills have been accepted.  If we are to continue along these lines, any attempt to reform the House will be a waste of time.  I speak in a positive vein but if individuals choose not to participate in the political system and do not try to change it, they allow it to take charge.  The system is not working or fit for purpose.  As the guardian of the House, the Chamber of the people, the Ceann Comhairle must know that its structures must be changed to make it fit for purpose.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_640">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1357">I do not have any interest in leaving this Bill on the Order Paper for a further six months.  This matter could have been addressed tonight or almost five years ago.  There is virtually no difference between the Bill recommended by the Law Reform Commission which served as the basis for this legislation and the original Bill presented by the Fine Gael Party four and a half years ago.  The provisions in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the Government has promised to introduce before 2 September will not be any different either.  I do not believe the Government will survive long enough to introduce the promised legislation.  For this reason, it should be dealt with tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">I thank the Deputies who spoke on the Bill, Deputy Flanagan who tabled it with me, my constituency and party colleague, Deputy Doyle, and others.  I also thank Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Costello who spoke on behalf of the Labour Party.  Deputy Lynch also spoke on the previous Bill four and a half years ago.  Nothing has been done in the meantime.  At the time we attributed the failure to proceed with legislation on this issue to the arrogance of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell.  However, when one compares him with the individuals who hold Cabinet positions today, the former Minister becomes something of a Florence Nightingale figure.  I am deeply surprised that pragmatic individuals such as Deputy Healy-Rae and others continue to support this arrogant Government which is out of touch with society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">In commending the Law Reform Commission I note with surprise that, under the chairmanship of Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, it has been subject to some implied criticism by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Last night the Minister asked the following question: "For example, should the advice, assistance or care given by a good samaritan or volunteer be restricted to the scene of an accident or should it include transportation to a hospital or other medical care facility?"  The answer is spelled out in section 3(2) which refers to "or other circumstance of serious and imminent danger".</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">The Minister also asked how far into the future protection from liability should stretch.  I look forward to seeing how he proposes to address this spurious argument in his Bill.  He has also asked who is a good samaritan and whether a person who injures someone and then assists the injured party can be described as a good samaritan.  Section 3(3) clearly defines a good samaritan and does not leave room for ambiguity.  If there was a difficulty with the Bill, it could have been addressed by amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not believe any such difficulty arises.  The Government's approach is reflective of the arrogance that has prevailed among its members for some years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">The Law Reform Commission has produced two reports and has been examining the concept behind the Bill which originated on this side of the House for four and a half years.  It produced a Bill, of which this legislation is a replica.  The Fine Gael Party used the commission's Bill in the belief the Government would not close the door on the commission.  For self-centred reasons, however, it chose to do precisely that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Deputy Flanagan outlined the heads of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last night.  While I do not know if we will be around in 30 years when the relevant Cabinet papers are released, I doubt if good samaritan legislation was discussed in the context of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">Deputy Joe Carey made a good point when he noted that the Minister could expedite the passage of the Bill by tacking it onto the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  The Government could just as well have done so, given that it proposes to include it in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the heads of which do not even refer to a good samaritan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">My motivation for introducing the Bill was purely to assist volunteers.  I have listened to mothers of children who died suddenly from cardiac arrest and representatives of voluntary groups.  Deputy Doyle and I could have filled the Visitors Gallery with 500 volunteers from County Wicklow alone.  I have in mind people such as Mr. John Fitzgerald who sits on the committee of the Wicklow community first responders, Mr. John O'Reilly, Ms Margaret Lynagh, Mr. Pat Dignam and Ms Susan Gorman.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">When I left the House last night following the debate on the Bill, there were no microphones, flashing cameras or lights.  I also note there is only one member of the media in the Press Gallery and the scant coverage given to the legislation.  The Bill tells me more about the Government than anything else.  I hope that when my party is sitting on the other side of the House in a few months from now, we will introduce this legislation.  If my party colleagues and I are fortunate enough to be elected to the House at the next election, I hope we never indulge in the patronising waffle I have heard from the Government side.  Rather than blaming Deputies O'Connor, Conlon and Dooley for this, I blame the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, both of whom are aware of the importance of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">I feel sorry for the officials present because I am sure that deep down they want to accept the legislation and know it would only do good at no cost.  Large sections of the community want the Bill to be enacted.  We could have lobbied and generated opposition to the Government's approach to it but instead chose to take a non-party political approach and remain silent until we discovered that the Government's position was that it would not accept the Bill.  It adopted this position because it is arrogant and out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">When the Government was formed, we had a budget surplus and thousands of new jobs were being created every year.  What do we have now?  The national debt has trebled in five or six months and thousands are losing their jobs every month.  In response to an Opposition proposal, we have encountered again the arrogance that is symptomatic of the Government.  I do not think that 30 seconds would do justice to the anger and despair I feel at the Government's approach.  A reference as made to the Taoiseach seeking proposals from this side of the House, yet here is a proposal that, strangely enough, everyone spoke in favour of.  In the wilds of south west Kerry, isolated people are dying from sudden cardiac arrest, but community organisations are afraid to get involved for fear of litigation.  I cannot understand why Deputy Healy-Rae and his Independent colleagues will not support a Bill that would not cost one cent.  It would have given a voice to the many reports on volunteerism and active citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">Spare me all the waffle I have heard from the Government benches.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_641">
            <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
            <p eId="para_1655">I thank whoever chooses the matters to be discussed on the Adjournment for giving me the opportunity to speak this evening.  I tabled this matter because over the weekend I remembered that some time ago the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission, Kieran Mulvey — whom I know well; he is a very able person — said, to great fanfare, that he would meet all the heads of the various trade unions for private discussions.  Since then there has been a long silence, and I have no way of finding out what happened except by tabling a matter on the Adjournment.  I am glad of the opportunity to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">I knew Kieran Mulvey particularly well during the years when he was the general secretary of the ASTI.  Later, when I became Minister for Education, I had extensive and regular interaction with the various trade unions.  I always thought it was a good thing that in all my time as Minister I did not have a row with any of the teachers' trade unions.  We managed to keep a friendship going, although we had tough meetings and there were times when things were extremely difficult.  All in all, however, we managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">Since then I have not seen much of Mr. Mulvey, although I know what he has been doing, and I thought his initiative to meet with the trade union heads was a remarkable one.  Any country will benefit from decent social relationships between the Government and all interested parties.  When there is good social cohesion, things go better.  There are many people within the trade union movement — just as there are many in the Dáil and throughout the country — who have the best interests of the country at heart and wish to see matters moving along in a more tranquil way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">It does the country no good to be in a situation in which people are not getting the services they require.  I crossed the street today and met a woman crying her eyes out outside the Passport Office because she could not get in.  She told me her tale and explained the sensitive and difficult situation she was in.  I thought it was so cruel that she could not go in and obtain what she legitimately sought, which was to update her passport.  Equally, I had four calls this evening from people who could not access social welfare offices.  It is incorrect to target those vulnerable people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">I am not faulting the trade unions.  They have their job to do and we have ours.  Our job is to govern the country, while theirs is to put across their points of view.  However, I do not like the way in which vulnerable people — in particular, those who need services badly — are being denied.  It is not affecting the political class because, by and large, we will get our business done, but it is affecting those who most need public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">I hope that when the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs replies to me he will have something of substance to say.  People are waiting to hear what is happening.  I am aware that there may be back-channels of communication and that talks may be going on.  I was particularly interested in the attitude of Mr. Mulvey and his wish to engage with the heads of the trade unions so that he could seek out common ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">We all wish to see the country move forward and to see ourselves coming out of the Slough of Despond.  We wish to see things brighten up for all of us — as consumers, as participants, as people living in this land — but we cannot do so unless there are harmonious relationships between all.  I hope there will be a resumption of talks with the trade unions and that they, in turn, will see that it is not right to target those who are vulnerable and to leave the weakest unaided in difficult circumstances such as I heard about today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, for coming to the House.  He occupies an office that I once occupied — the nicest office in town, if the truth be known.  Is that right?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1666">I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising the matter and acknowledge her service as one of my predecessors.  I will not comment on the office as I do not have that much experience in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">As the Deputy stated, the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, spoke on RTE's "The Week in Politics" on 24 January about the availability of the Labour Relations Commission to facilitate and assist, in any appropriate way, a process of dialogue between the parties involved in the current industrial action in the public service.  I should point out that there are ongoing contacts, as a matter of course, between public service management and unions, both in the context of formal industrial relations processes and regarding the conduct of the current industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">Beyond these operational contacts, the Government believes it would be desirable that both public service unions and management would engage on the wider transformation agenda and the future development of public services and public service employment.  However, everyone recognises that the context must be right.  There must be a shared understanding of the parameters of any engagement and a willingness to explore what potential exists within those parameters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">Any industrial action is regrettable, particularly when it impacts on service delivery to the public.  We all know of cases similar to that described by Deputy O'Rourke.  Everything possible is being done to minimise any impact.  Whereas the right of unions to take industrial action can be acknowledged, this must be tempered by the obligation to provide a service to the taxpayer, particularly in the areas referred to by Deputy O'Rourke.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">As the Taoiseach stated in the House in recent days, the legitimate concerns of public servants will not be advanced in any way through industrial conflict.  The Government welcomes recent comments from figures on the trade union side to the effect that an agreed solution to the current difficulties is both desirable and possible.  There is a shared view on the sort of changes across the public service that would produce greater efficiency, better services for the public and — as important — more satisfactory working conditions for public servants.  It is through engagement on that agenda, rather than industrial action, that the issues of concern to public servants can be properly addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">Public service transformation remains a key priority for this Government.  Far from being hostile to the public service, the Government is committed to a public service worthy of the best traditions of those who have worked tirelessly to develop our State and its institutions over many decades.  We believe that the public interest and the long-term interest of public servants coincide in creating a public service of which we can be proud, and equally, a public service which we can afford, both now and into the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">Both the Government, especially in its role as employer, and trade unions recognise that change is important, and both sides know what needs to be done in each sector to achieve change.  It is important for the public service and the citizen that there is engagement on this reform agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">I am acutely aware of the difficulty that the reductions in public service pay are causing people on a personal basis but the Government had to take these decisions to stabilise the public finances.  We did this not because we wanted to, but because we had to.  They are simply a matter of budgetary necessity in these extraordinarily difficult times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Ultimately, it is only through real and lasting change based on constant renewal, redesigning how we do our business and fully applying the potential of new technology and challenging accepted ways of working and organisational structures that those who work in the public service will be able to sustain their standard of living.  The surest route to secure and stable income levels is to embrace change.  There are well-established channels of communication with representatives of the trade unions in the public service and I emphasise that these can be used to signal a willingness to engage in dialogue and pursue a process of meaningful engagement on the challenges facing us.</p>

          <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" eId="spk_645">
            <from>Deputy Rory O’Hanlon</from>
            <p eId="para_1675">This issue arose from two incidents, the visit of the ambassador of Israel to Carrickmacross and then the decision of Carrickmacross Town Council to remove the page which he had signed from the distinguished visitors book.  I regret the decision to remove the page and the nature of the protest on the day of the ambassador's visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">When an ambassador visits a town, he or she should be welcomed and treated with respect in a way that reflects their status as a diplomat and personal dignity.  This does mean that one necessarily approves of the policies of his or her government.  I met very many people in Carrickmacross at the weekend and they all believe that the ambassador should have been shown such respect and courtesy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">I understand the feelings shared by all the members of Carrickmacross Town Council and I too feel strongly about the injustices which we see in Gaza and the West Bank on a continuing basis.  I met the Israeli ambassador when he visited Carrickmacross on that day and spent one hour in discussion with him.  I was glad of the opportunity to have such discussion and impressed on him the seriousness of Ireland's engagement on the issue of concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">I have visited the Middle East twice over the past two years.  Last July, I was a member of a delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which visited Gaza at the invitation of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, where we met its director, Mr. John Ging.  During that visit we saw, at first hand, the ongoing dire humanitarian consequences for the civilian population as a result of the ongoing Israeli blockade.  We published a report on our visit and set out in direct and unambiguous terms our view that it is not reasonable or right for Israel to use the complexity of the issues involved as justification for allowing the intolerable humanitarian conditions which prevail in the West Bank and, more particularly, in Gaza to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">I have no qualms about being direct and honest in criticising Israel where appropriate.  I have supported the findings of the Goldstone report, which calls on Israel and the relevant Palestinian authorities to launch appropriate investigations into allegations of war crimes committed during the Gaza conflict which are independent and in conformity with international standards.  I wish to see an end to violence on both sides.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">I spoke out in this House when Israel forcibly returned to Gaza a young Bethlehem university student, Berlanty Assam, without just cause.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the vast majority of Members in this House actively support a two-state solution which would provide peace and security on both sides in the Middle East.  This can only happen through a negotiated settlement.  We know better than most in Northern Ireland the futility of overreaction and the politics of the last atrocity, and it was when Senator George Mitchell came to Ireland and that dialogue commenced seriously that we made progress.  I wish him the same success in the Middle East as he had here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">I cannot support the obliteration of the name of the Israeli ambassador from the records of Carrickmacross Town Council.  The political way forward is dialogue and negotiation.  We must uphold democracy and principles of respecting the right to meet and to listen to those with whom we may not always agree politically.  We have a responsibility to remain engaged and to remain committed to finding a solution in the Middle East.  Refusing to recognise and respect the ambassador of Israel will not in any way contribute to that goal.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_646" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1682">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, have asked me to send their regrets but they both have engagements.  Responding to articles which appeared in the Irish, British and Israeli media, the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Tuesday regretting the decision of the Carrickmacross Town Council to remove the signature of the Israeli ambassador from the council's distinguished visitors book.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">I am pleased to have the opportunity this evening to read the Minister's statement into the record of the House. The Minister said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1684">I fully understand and share the deep concerns which many people in Ireland feel in regard to Israel's policies on a number of issues, including the settlement of east Jerusalem and the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza, as well as the allegations of the use of forged Irish passports by Israeli agents.  I made our concerns on these matters known last week when I met the Israeli Foreign Minister and visited Gaza.  However, it is a basic principle of relations between states that we treat each other's diplomatic representatives with civility and respect, regardless of any policy differences.  To do otherwise would seriously undermine the ability of states to conduct international relations.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1685">Ambassadors represent not just their governments but their peoples.  In turn, the way that foreign ambassadors are welcomed and received in Ireland says something about us as a people.  Foreign ambassadors are free to travel in Ireland and I encourage them to do so.  If citizens here feel moved to protest against the policies of the governments they represent, which they have the right to do, I would ask that the do so peacefully and in a way that respects the diplomatic status and personal dignity of the ambassador.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">It is indeed the case that many people in Ireland share the Government's deep concerns about Israel's policies in the occupied Palestinian territories, including restrictions on movement, construction of illegal settlements, evictions of families and demolition of their homes, as well as the continuing blockade of Gaza.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government, has been active and indeed outspoken on these issues at EU and UN level.  The Minister has taken every opportunity to make these concerns known directly to Israeli leaders, including to Israeli Ministers and to the Israeli ambassador here in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Last week, the Minister became the first EU Minister for a year to visit Gaza.  He was determined to visit Gaza to see for himself the humanitarian situation in the strip.  Having been denied entry by Israel, he obtained the agreement of the Egyptian Government to entry through the Rafa crossing.  Speaking from Gaza, he made a direct public appeal for the lifting of the Israeli blockade.  It is understandable that people may wish to make clear their own concerns, to voice protests and to do something <i> </i>about these issues.  However, this should not extend to using insulting behaviour towards the Israeli ambassador, or indeed, any other diplomatic representative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">We expect our own ambassadors abroad to be able to travel and meet people in the countries to which we send them and sometimes to deliver unwelcome messages, safely and with respect for their personal dignity and their status as representatives of Ireland.  If we want our ambassador in Israel — or anywhere else — to be heard with courtesy and respect, we must reciprocate those practices here.  It would be misguided to remove the page in the visitors' book which the ambassador of Israel had been invited to sign, regardless of who invited him and in whose presence he signed.  I understand that those who decided to do so were motivated by a desire to protest against Israeli Government policies, but to treat the ambassador as a pariah, to try literally to erase the fact of his visit from the record, was excessive and could be misunderstood.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Israeli citizens and Israel's supporters around the world are foremost among the people we are trying to reach and whose views we are trying to influence.  Indeed, we should not overlook the fact that the strongest, most dogged and most consistent opponents of many of the Israeli Government policies we decry are in fact among the citizens of Israel.  For those who would rather Ireland's messages were not heard, nothing could be more welcome than a story such as this.  It can and will be used to suggest that Irish concerns about Israel are founded not on a concern to right wrongs, but on vehement antipathy bordering on racism.  That would of course be grossly untrue, but we must remember that protest taken too far can undermine the force of the very message that those who protest are seeking to convey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">I know that the members of Carrickmacross Town Council considered this question at short notice and I do not doubt the sincerity of the concerns which led them to decide on that occasion as they did.  However, now that they have had an opportunity to reflect fully on the issues I have outlined here, I hope that they might wish to reconsider their decision and express their views by more appropriate means.</p>

          <heading>River Basin Management Plan.</heading>
          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_647">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_1691">I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss the important matter of the River Shannon basin district.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to update this House on when he will implement and fund the river basin management plan for the River Shannon international river basin district.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">Signing off on any plan is the easy part.  For this Government, as we know to our cost, implementation and funding are the hard parts and open to an extended timeframe.  In  light of the severe weather conditions experienced this winter, any delay in implementing and funding this plan will be detrimental to the management of our waterways.  When the Minister signed off on the river basin management plan for the River Shannon basin district last October, he had no idea of the flooding that was to result from the unprecedented weather conditions, and which has destroyed our waterways, particularly in the midlands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">The European Union water framework directive, which was adopted in 2000, requires all governments to manage their rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, groundwater, protected areas, estuaries and coastal waters.  A good status for these waterways must be reached by 2015.  In a written reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on this matter, the Minister stated that plans for the Shannon international river basin district would be completed in the coming months.  That is an extremely flexible timescale.  Could he perhaps pin that down somewhat this evening and tell this House when exactly the plan will be finalised?</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Given the lack of input by the Government to the alleviation of the flooding in the midlands, it will be another case of an EU directive deadline not being met.  The Shannon is the lifeblood of the midlands, but unless properly managed under the control of one authority, it could become a liability, with a reoccurrence of the devastation caused by the flooding, which destroyed housing, land and silage and led to a loss of income for already hard hit farmers, businesses and householders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The draft river plan is interestingly entitled "Water Matters",  which could be interpreted in a couple of ways.  We are particularly aware of the meaning in the midlands, as water is essential to us in so many ways, from its management to its tourism value.  However, is the Minister so aware?  He has made no real effort at any stage to address the problems of the midlands since this winter's flooding, especially when compared to the focus on Cork and the south.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which I am a member, announced plans to visit Cork to assess the flood damage, I refused to go until similar plans were made for the midlands.  This problem will be somewhat rectified next week, when the committee will asses the damage to the midlands region with presentations from the county managers of Longford, Westmeath, Galway, Limerick and Roscommon.  Stakeholders will be represented such as the Office of Public Works, Waterways Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Central Fisheries Board, the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, the Irish Farmers Association and the Heritage Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">This brings me to another matter which I have highlighted on many occasions in this House, and will continue to do so until it is resolved, namely, the setting up of a Shannon authority to bring the Shannon stakeholders together under one umbrella.  I hope to bring a Private Members' Bill on a Shannon authority before the House to highlight the need for such a body.  It will propose that a Shannon authority be set up by statute which would have control over river management and development in the Shannon catchment and Shannon navigation areas, from the source of the river to the Shannon Estuary at Limerick.  This is essential to control flooding maintenance works, to develop navigation tourism, to produce electric power and to improve farming and forest practices and public health.  It is no longer possible for diverse interests to operate in isolation if the problems of the longest waterway in Ireland are to be solved.  I would welcome a positive response on the matter this evening.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">The River Shannon basin management plan is currently being finalised and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expects that it will be adopted by the relevant local authorities in the coming months.  Significant funding has been provided by the Department over the past number of years to support the development of this plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">The making of a river basin management plan is a function reserved to local authorities.  In December 2008, local authorities published draft river basin management plans, including a draft plan for the River Shannon basin district.  These draft plans were open to public consultation for a period of six months up to June 2009, and over 300 submissions from interested parties were received.  The plans will be adopted by the relevant local authorities in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">The transposition of the water framework directive in 2003 saw the establishment of eight river basin districts on the island of Ireland, including the River Shannon basin district.  A river basin district project office, funded by the Department, was established in each of the seven districts in the State to co-ordinate the making of river basin management plans with the aim of protecting and improving the water environment within the catchment.  Exchequer funding in excess of €8 million has been provided since 2003 to the River Shannon basin district.  This funding has supported extensive research work and the operation of the river basin district office for the catchment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The river basin management planning process has provided a mechanism through which local authorities, the EPA, different Departments and other stakeholders can co-ordinate their actions to achieve the best possible environmental outcomes.  The plans will be co-ordinated with other relevant plans, including flood risk management plans to be prepared by the OPW, as part of the implementation of the floods directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The process is also being supported by a national advisory committee, which was established in 2009 to co-ordinate work on the finalisation of plans and with a view to overseeing their subsequent implementation.  The committee is chaired by the Department and its membership is drawn from the local authorities — the County and City Managers Association — the EPA and key Government Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">The Shannon River basin management plan, in common with all such plans, will set out the current status of waters in that district, the environmental objectives which it is aimed to achieve and the measures which will be required in order to achieve those objectives.  The programmes of measures must be operational by the end of 2012.  The plan will cover the period to 2015, with further plans to cover the subsequent periods to 2021 and 2027.  The plan will aim to improve waters which are currently classified as less than good status and will aim to preserve the quality of waters which are classified as good or high status.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_649">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1705">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for discussion on the Adjournment.  The difficulty in respect of this matter relates to the fact that the livelihoods of upland farmers in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg range in north and west Mayo are being decimated as a result of the discriminatory way in which their share of modulation money from Europe is calculated.  Some €18 million in funding is available to 30,000 Irish sheep farmers and the payments in respect thereof are calculated on the basis of ewe numbers rather than on hectares.  In other words, it is done on the basis of 2.5 ewes per hectare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">Problems arise because Nephin Beg is a special protection area, SPA.  This means that all sheep farmers operating there have been obliged to drastically reduce their stock numbers as a result of the five-year pilot programme aimed at protecting the range from the effects of overgrazing.  Most of these farmers had no choice but to reduce their stock numbers by 30% to 50%.  This is a serious impediment because they are obliged to remove their animals from the mountains for prolonged periods.  This, in turn, has an effect on the type of farming in which they can engage on their low-lying lands.  On one hand, these farmers are suffering because they have been obliged to destock, while, on the other, their payments are being drastically reduced because their grants are calculated on ewe numbers.  The simple solution to this problem would be to calculate their payments on the basis of the number of hectares they farm rather than on that of stock numbers or to introduce a special calculation method in respect of SPAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">The problem to which I refer is confined to the Nephin Beg region and to Connemara in County Galway.  As a result, the introduction of a special calculation method would not trigger a series of claims from farmers in other areas.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is aware of the situation that obtains in Connemara and is sympathetic to the plight of the farmers there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">It is vital that immediate action be taken in order to resolve this matter, particularly in view of the fact that another issue is on the horizon for the farmers of Nephin Beg.  I refer to the fact that their entitlement to payment under the new REP scheme will be drastically reduced.  Under REPS 4, farmers received €242 per hectare.  If the new proposals are accepted, the payment will be reduced to €75 per hectare.  This is unfair and unjust and represents another attack on the sheep farmers who are trying to eke out a living in the upland regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">There is no cost involved to the Exchequer in respect of this matter because what is at issue is modulation money from Europe.  This matter relates to fairness and justice.  We often discuss fairness and equity in this House.  People do not mind taking the pain if they are treated fairly.  A group of sheep farmers in the Nephin Beg range have not been treated fairly.  Under the new arrangements coming down the track, that will continue to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, to ensure that action is taken.  Someone must shout stop.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_1711">Fáiltím roimh an deis a thug an Teachta Ó Mathúna dom freagra a thabhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo thar ceann mo chomhghleacaí an tAire Talmhaíochta, Iascaigh agus Bia, an Teachta Breandán Mac Gabhann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">The sheep sector is an important part of the agricultural economy and plays a vital role in preserving our rural economy, landscape and environment.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, is fully aware of the difficulties the sector is facing.  In that regard, he has announced a number of initiatives in recent times to assist the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">Deputy O'Mahony will be aware that last autumn the Minister announced that payments would be made to eligible farmers under the upland sheep payment — a once-off payment worth €7 million in total and financed from the single farm payment national reserve.  Payments in the region of €5 million had issued by the end of last year, with the additional top-up payment from the remaining €2 million due to be paid shortly.  The decision to use this funding — the only funding available from the single farm payment national reserve — in this manner was in clear recognition of the particular difficulties being experienced by Irish sheep farmers.  The upland sheep payment is payable to those farmers who declared their sheep under the 2007 and the 2008 sheep census and who declared mountain-type grazing under the 2009 disadvantaged areas scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">It was decided to use €18 million of the €25 million in additional funding for each of the years 2010 to 2012, inclusive, to which we gained access following the agreement reached under the CAP health check on a grassland sheep scheme to support incomes in the sheep sector.  This means that an additional €54 million will be made available to the sector during the next three years.  The payment will be made in the form of a grassland sheep area payment, which will place no additional administrative burden on sheep farmers and will mean that the payment of aid can be made by the Department in an efficient and timely manner.  The Department is working on the finer details of the scheme in order to ensure that it will meet its objectives.  These details are currently being finalised and it is expected that an announcement in respect of the scheme will be made shortly.  As further evidence of the Minister's commitment to the sheep sector, an additional €8 million for sheep fencing and mobile handling facilities, to assist sheep farmers in reducing labour input, as part of a new targeted on-farm investment scheme, has also been made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">With regard to the sheep farmers in the Nephin Beg area, when the single payment scheme was implemented in 2005 the calculation of the payment entitlements of such farmers was based on the years 1997-1998, before destocking commenced.  This facility was introduced in the scheme in recognition of the specific circumstances of those sheep farmers who had been obliged to destock under the provisions of a REPS plan, a commonage framework plan or other recognised agri-environment plans.  This mechanism allowed those affected farmers to benefit from their full single payment, based on their actual sheep farming activities prior to the necessary destocking.  These farmers continue to benefit from that level of single payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Special provision has also been made for these farmers under the rules of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Under this scheme, applicants are normally required to have a holding with a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare.  However, a special derogation is made for those farmers who have been obliged to destock.  Where it is evident that such farmers were obliged, due to the provisions of a REPS plan, a commonage framework plan other agri-environment plan, to destock to the extent that their stocking level has fallen below the minimum level required under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In such circumstances, the stocking level as defined in the relevant plan is deemed acceptable under the scheme, with full payment being made to the farmers concerned subject to the other conditions of the scheme having been satisfied.  I am in a position to conclude, therefore, that not only has the Minister made every effort to assist the sheep sector in general but he has also sought special provisions to assist sheep farmers in the Nephin Beg area to whom Deputy O'Mahony refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1720">The 2009 Employment Control Framework, which encompasses the moratorium, contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The Framework provided for the creation of 225 new development posts, including 35 posts specifically for the development of child and adolescent mental health teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">The Framework also included a general exemption from the moratorium for certain therapy, psychologist and counsellor posts.  This was designed to provide further flexibility to the HSE in order to maintain key front line services and to support the implementation of policies such as A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">The 2009 Employment Control Framework also provided for a process whereby a limited number of exceptions to the moratorium were approved by my Department with the consent of the Department of Finance.  Amongst the exemptions approved during 2009 were 23 mental health nurse posts at the Central Mental Hospital and 36 mental health nurse posts at St Loman's Hospital, Lucan.  These exceptions were approved on the basis of the two hospitals making better use of their staffing resource, leading to overall efficiencies in the delivery of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">A 2010 Employment Control Framework is currently being finalised between my officials and the Department of Finance.  Although this Framework is not yet finalised, I expect that in 2010, it will again provide my Department and the HSE with the ability to deal with critical exceptions to the moratorium once the overall reduction in health employment numbers, as agreed by Government, are being met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">The Government have been clear in our view that the VHI should achieve authorisation on a level playing field with other insurers.  A stable, community-rated health insurance market, supported by a robust risk equalisation system, will be achieved in circumstances where all the players in the market are authorised and regulated on a level playing field.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">The capital position of the VHI presently, and the prospects for its reserves over the medium term, are some of the key factors in the decision of the Financial Regulator to grant authorisation.  Clearly, the reserve position of the VHI is influenced by the measures in place currently, and in prospect for the future, whereby the costs of claims for older people are supported by younger insured persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">There are a great many inter-related factors involved in setting out the roadmap now to a stable, community-rated health insurance market, all of which are under consideration by the Government.

            <p eId="para_1732">Where over-the-counter medicines are prescribed and supplied under the GMS and community drugs schemes, reimbursement prices are controlled by regulations and agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

There is no regulation of the prices of over-the-counter products in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">Retail prices in Ireland may differ from those in the UK for a variety of reasons. These include changes in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro, differing VAT rates and market size.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">In September 2009 the National Consumer Agency carried out a survey on the cost of personal care goods and over the counter medicines.  The survey revealed significant price differences between retailers for these products.

As a result, insurers that cover a higher proportion of older people will be at a significant competitive disadvantage and insurers will seek to avoid insuring older people.  It follows that, without risk equalisation or loss compensation, competition will not function properly and the market will operate counter to the interests of ill and older people.  This is why it is the international norm for risk equalisation or loss compensation to apply in community rated markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">The Health Insurance Authority has started work on preparing a comprehensive risk equalisation scheme to replace the interim scheme of loss compensation when it expires.  I intend to bring proposals in this regard to the Government before the end of March.</p>

In this context, I have agreed with the Health Service Executive, as part of its 2010 Service Plan, that it will establish an organ donation and transplantation unit within its existing national structures and resources.  This unit will provide a national focal point for reporting, monitoring and assessing organ donation and transplantation activities.  It is appropriate that these functions be carried out at a national level on the basis of regular, comprehensive performance data provided by all the transplant centres.  This approach will provide a sound basis for evaluating performance and examining other issues related to transplantation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1757">I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 73 and 85 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The most recent information on bed closures in the acute hospital system refers to the week ended 17 January 2010.  At that time, 689 inpatient beds and 37 day beds were closed for reasons of cost-containment, infection control, refurbishment and seasonal closure of facilities.  Due to industrial action involving members of IMPACT, my Department has not been in a position to obtain more up-to-date information from the HSE in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">While public debate tends to focus on bed numbers, it is much more meaningful to measure the actual number of patients treated.  In 2009, the combined number of inpatient and day case discharges was 3% greater than the equivalent figure in 2008, despite the difficult situation in relation to resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The preparation of the HSE's 2010 National Service Plan, which I approved on 5 February, maintains the focus on increased efficiency and targets broadly the same level of overall hospital activity as in 2009.  This involves a shift from inpatient to day cases, a reduction in emergency admissions and a further increase in day cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">While there is no proposal in the Service Plan to close a specific number of beds, the reduction in inpatient treatments will mean that less capacity will be required in this area during 2010.  The exact number of beds available at any one time will fluctuate depending on such factors as planned activity levels, maintenance and refurbishment requirements and staff leave arrangements. Beds may also be closed from time to time in order to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allotted budget for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">Meeting the agreed efficiency targets will require increased access to the specialist skills and senior clinical decision-making available in Medical Assessment Units, to diagnostics and to other ambulatory care services. The HSE will also focus on minimising length of stay, with a particular focus on reducing the current variation across different hospitals for similar procedures.  It will also work to increase same day of surgery admission and to protect inpatient beds for elective surgery in order to reduce waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">By reforming the manner in which services are provided, I am confident that the HSE can deliver the volumes of service provided for in the plan, while at the same time continuing to improve service quality and patient outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1765">The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity was published in 2005.  An Inter-sectoral Group on Obesity, comprising relevant Government Departments and key stakeholders was established early in 2009 to oversee and monitor implementation of its recommendations.  The Inter-sectoral Group published a report in April 2009, detailing progress on each of the Taskforce recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">The report provided 93 recommendations for action aimed at six sectors. These included:</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">5 aimed at high level government</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">22 for the education sector</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">20 for those responsible for the physical environment</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The examination by the Group showed that significant progress has been made on implementation of over 30% of these recommendations while partial implementation has occurred in another third and action is still progressing on 25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">However the Report indicated that while significant progress had been made across all sectors, there is a continuing need for concerted action in order to halt the rise in obesity.  The Group also gave some consideration to key priority areas for action in the short to medium term.These included measures to increase physical activity among children; continued awareness programmes on the dangers of excessive consumption of foods high in fat, sugar and salt; increased control on advertising and marketing of food and drinks aimed at children; and improved training for health professionals in obesity prevention and diagnosing and counselling those at risk of obesity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">The work of the Inter-sectoral Group on Obesity is currently being examined in the context of a wider review of the policy in relation to lifestyle-related illnesses to which obesity is a major contributory factor.</p>

            <p eId="para_1777">The Health Service Executive, with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin (Dublin North West and Dublin Central) to the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure improved turnaround times for processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The PCRS currently has responsibility for about 337,500 medical card clients aged 70 and over and over 90,000 medical card clients from the two local health offices, who qualified for their medical card under the general medical card scheme.  This brings the total medical card population currently under PCRS management to 427,500, which represents almost 29% of the total medical card population (1,486,084).</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE show that in 2009, the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications.  This included nearly 42,000 reviews.  In relation to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 days and 95% within 30 days.  The HSE has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_1791">Approximately 77 million laboratory tests are undertaken annually across 44 public hospitals.  At present the annual cost of this service is approximately €470 million.  The workload comprises both urgent and non-urgent tests and a significant proportion of the activity originates in the primary care setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">An external review of laboratory services was conducted for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services in 2007.  The review highlighted limitations in the current organisation of laboratories, which have an impact on quality, turnaround time and cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">In light of the review, the HSE announced plans last year to modernise laboratory services and to introduce significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of these services.  The HSE has already had significant engagement with stakeholders in progressing this initiative.  Groups such as the Faculty of Pathology, the Association of Clinical Biochemists and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association will have an ongoing input into the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">As part of this initiative, the HSE has commenced discussions with the National Development Finance Agency about the capital financing of a small number of dedicated "cold" laboratories to process the large volumes of routine patient tests currently undertaken in hospital laboratories.  This will include a robust analysis of the cold laboratory business model from a ‘Value for Money' perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">I am also pleased to say that some improvements in laboratory service have taken place since the completion of the review. The number of individual laboratory disciplines which have been accredited has increased significantly. In addition, some reconfiguration of laboratory services has been achieved by transferring work undertaken in a number of small laboratories to larger laboratories. This allows for a higher level of throughput. I want to acknowledge the important role of staff and other stakeholders in effecting these changes and the shared commitment of all to the objective of high quality, cost effective laboratory services.</p>

The design brief for the new hospital and the paediatric ambulatory and urgent care centre at The Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght has been developed.  It is planned to progress this centre in the same manner and in the same timescale as the main hospital development.  A design team was appointed in late 2009.

            <p eId="para_1820">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 120 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which I welcomed, highlighted a number of important ways in which services to patients at Emergency Departments can be improved.  Many of the findings are being addressed by the HSE in the context of its National Service Plan 2010.  The actions include improving access to diagnostics, proactive discharge planning, improving average length of stay, increasing day cases, same day admissions and improving the waiting time for patients following a decision to admit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The report highlights important issues about how we devote our resources to emergency care and how we can get the best possible outcome for patients. The report is very much in line with the steps already underway by the HSE to reduce waiting times for patients and improve the efficiency of Emergency Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">While the report rightly points to unacceptable waiting times for patients waiting to be admitted, it is important to note that:</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">94% of patients who do <i>not</i> require admission were treated and discharged within the HSE’s maximum target of 6 hours last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">87% of <i>all</i> patients at EDs (whether admitted or not) were treated and admitted or discharged within 6 hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">54% of patients needing admission get a bed within 6 hours.  While this remains an area of continuing attention, it has improved from just 40% in February 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">The key issues raised by the report are being addressed as a matter of priority. Specifically:</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">Clinical Directors have been appointed to each acute hospital, and will play a pivotal role in the organisation of effective ED services that meet patients' needs without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">The new consultant contract is based on a consultant-delivered service, which will help improve access to senior clinical decision making and help patients move through the service as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">There has been significant capital investment in Emergency Departments to improve both the fabric of the units and their capacity to meet patients' needs effectively.  There has also been investment in the provision of  Medical Assessment Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">There has been substantial investment in services that reduce the need for hospital admission, including primary care teams, home care packages and home helps.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">The Fair Deal scheme will help reduce delays in discharging patients from hospital, alleviating pressures on beds.  The Minister has provided €97m for the scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">We need efficiencies throughout the health system.  The C&amp;AG's report raises important questions about the ratio of staff to patients in different EDs which will be pursued in detail by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">My Department will continue to work with the HSE to address the issues raised in the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">In relation to ED waiting times overall, I have held a series of meetings with HSE senior management to review progress and discuss next steps.</p>

            <p eId="para_1847">The HSE and my Department are monitoring the evolving situation regarding this industrial action carefully, in close co-operation with the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">The action, which is underway across the public service, has the potential to cause serious disruption in the health sector, depending on its scope and scale.  My main concern is to ensure that the effect of the dispute on patient care is minimised as much as possible and, so far, this has been achieved.  The Deputy will be aware that IMPACT commenced an intensification of the industrial action yesterday.  This intensification includes the non-answering of telephone calls in certain locations across the HSE for certain periods, a  refusal to carry out work of any vacant posts, non-cooperation with the HSE's reconfiguration programme and a refusal to deal with Parliamentary matters, including Parliamentary Questions and Freedom of Information requests.  I regret that the union has taken this course of action and that members of the public have been inconvenienced as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">There is no doubt that, following a period of rapid increase in funding, the health services are now facing the challenge of managing within much tighter resource constraints. There is scope within our health system, by reforming the way services are delivered, to achieve more through greater efficiency and concentrating on services that contribute most to people's health and well-being.  There is an onus on all concerned — Government, management, trade unions and employees — to find a way of engaging on the reforms which are needed to deliver better services to patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1851">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has the operational responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, which includes the medical card and GP visit card benefits.  The HSE has informed my Department that when a medical card comes up for review, the current circumstances of the medical card holder are evaluated to ensure that they continue to hold eligibility, and that this involves a standard review process.  Medical card reviews/renewal forms are issued to medical card clients three months in advance of their eligibility review date in order to give clients sufficient time to complete the review form and to provide the required evidence of income, etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_1855">The Deputy will be aware that Government Policy is to support people including those suffering from all forms of dementia to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  Community supports have been enhanced over the years and increased levels of funding have been made available to develop a wide range of community based services, including for example community nursing, home help services and support to family carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">Current policy on dementia is informed by a number of reports and strategies, principally the Action Plan on Dementia.  However there is now a need to re-examine this issue and it is intended that preliminary work will be carried out in 2010 on scoping work for developing a Dementia Policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1862">Heart and lung transplantation operations take place in the Mater Hospital Dublin.  Eleven heart transplantation procedures were carried out in 2009; this compares with 4 heart transplants in 2008.  Five lung transplantation procedures were carried out in 2009; this compares with 4 lung transplants in 2008.

            <p eId="para_1863">This performance should also be viewed in the context of the very strong overall performance of organ transplantation and donation in 2009. 172 kidney transplants were carried out in Beaumont Hospital in 2009, compared with 146 transplants in 2008.  The 2009 figure is the highest level of kidney transplants ever achieved in the transplant programme.  Kidney transplants have increased by 33% between 2005 and 2009.  Ireland's deceased donation rate in 2009 is estimated to be about 20 deceased donors per million population, which should place Ireland in the top third of organ donation performance within Europe.</p>

However <i>’A Vision for Change’</i> the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a seven to ten year period and recommends that the remaining psychiatric hospitals should close and that patients should be relocated to more appropriate community based settings.</p>

In 2010 the HSE will dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €50 million in developing the new mental health infrastructure.  Projects which will be progressed in 2010 include the development of an acute unit at Beaumont to replace the acute unit at of St Ita’s Portrane, the construction of a Community Nursing Unit in Clonmel which will enable St Luke’s Hospital to close later this year and the construction of a Community Nursing Unit in Mullingar to facilitate the closure of St Lomans’s Hospital.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_683">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1870">I take it that the Deputy is referring to a recent Draft Report by the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Public Safety which is a response to the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the European Union and the Partnership was established to support Member States by providing a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer control, and by engaging relevant stakeholders across the EU in a collective effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">The Commission's Communication on the Partnership set out a number of objectives for reducing the burden of cancer. In relation to early detection an Objective for Action is to achieve 100% population coverage of screening for breast, colorectal and cervical cancer as recommended in Council Recommendation 2003/878/EC. This Recommendation proposes that Member States offer screening for these cancers for specified age groups. A 2008 Report by the Commission found that overall only half the population who should be covered by screening according to the Recommendation actually were.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">In Ireland, the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) has responsibility for the delivery of population based cancer screening programmes.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in expanding our cancer screening programmes and Government has made available more than €64 million this year for breast and cervical screening and for preparatory work for the national colorectal cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">CervicalCheck, the national cervical screening programme, was established nationwide in 2008. The programme provides free smear tests every three years to women aged 25 to 44 years of age and every five years for women aged 45 to 60. This is in accordance with the Recommendation (screening starting not before the age of 20 and not later than the age of 30). In 2009, around 280,000 women were screened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, provides free mammograms every two years for women aged 50 to 64. During 2009 BreastCheck reached all counties and over 122,000 women were screened. I expect this number to increase during 2010. The Council Recommendation is that mammography screening should be provided to women aged 50 to 69 years. It remains my intention to extend BreastCheck to women in the 65-69 age group as resources and capacity allow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">In January I announced the beginning of important work on a national colorectal cancer screening programme. Screening will commence in 2012 for all men and women aged between 60 and 69. This programme will be extended to all those aged 55 to 74 years of age as logistics and resources allow. Other countries including England, Sweden and Finland have aimed their programmes at this 60 to 69 year age group also. While the Council recommends that the colorectal screening test should be available for men and women aged 50 to 74, the Expert Advisory Group convened by HIQA agreed that the appropriate age range for a programme based on faecal testing is 55 to 74 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">A key objective of our National Cancer Control Strategy is that Ireland will have a system of cancer control  that reduces our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other European countries. Prevention and early detection are vital components of this strategy. Screening has been a priority for the Government and approximately 400,000 women received free screening in the BreastCheck and CervicalCheck programmes in 2009. The commencement of colorectal screening for the 60 to 69 age group in 2012 will be a further important milestone in the implementation of the Strategy. As I have said, it is my intention to extend the age cohorts covered by breast and colorectal screening programmes in due course and to continue to build on the considerable progress already made by Ireland in regard to the provision of cancer screening.</p>

            <p eId="para_1878">The management of the Health Service Executive, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and my Department remain committed to implementing the Government decision, which was originally taken in 2006, to transfer the Community Welfare Service (CWS) from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There have been prolonged periods of engagement with the health sector unions since that time but, to date, no agreement has been reached.  The employment status of employees and their terms and conditions are just some of the issues which have already been identified and on which agreement will need to be reached with the relevant health sector unions, prior to the transfer of the CWS taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">Most recently, facilitated talks had begun under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, with a small sub-group, representative of management and unions, engaged in intensive discussions.  However, both SIPTU and IMPACT informed the Labour Relations Commission, in January of this year, that they were not  in a position to attend the conciliation conferences which had been scheduled to take place.  This was due to the fact that they were to be engaged in intensive dialogue/consultation with their membership throughout the month of January, regarding the Government decision to reduce the remuneration of public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">Following this consultation, I understand that both unions have informed the LRC that they are unable to engage in these discussions, due to the ongoing industrial action across the public service.  As a result of this development, these intensive talks in relation to the transfer of the CWS cannot now go ahead as planned.  This decision by the unions is unwarranted, given the already unacceptable delays in implementing a Government decision that was taken nearly 4 years ago now.  Ultimately, this transfer is one which will see the CWS being properly located in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and will result in a better service for the public who avail of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1884">In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in so-called head shops, the Government has agreed to the introduction of regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which will introduce controls, similar to those introduced recently in the UK, on a range of substances which are currently on sale in head shops. In accordance with EU law, it will be necessary to notify the Commission of the proposed regulations in case they impact on legitimate industrial activities and this imposes a 3 month stand still period on implementation of the regulations. These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  Some of the substances in question have legitimate uses  — for example, in the production of plastics and industrial solvents. It will be necessary to assess the level of use of these substances by industry in Ireland and the implications for industry of placing these substances under the ambit of Misuse of Drugs legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and its associated regulations control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.   Minister of State John Curran, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">A Research Advisory Group (RAG) has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of head shops. The RAG held its first meeting on 13 January 2010. It has representatives from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, the Health Research Board, Revenue Custom's Service, the Forensic State Laboratory and other relevant stakeholders. The RAG will report incrementally until its work is complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_1888">As the Deputy will be aware, the current legislation for health and personal social services has been in place for many years and there is a need now to have a clear set of statutory provisions that ensure equity and transparency and to bring the system up to date with developments in service delivery and technology that have occurred since the Health Act 1970. Accordingly, work is underway in the Department on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for health and personal social services. The legislation will define specific health and personal social services more clearly; set out who should be eligible for what services, as well as criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework. As the Deputy will appreciate, this is a very complex undertaking as the current legislation has been in place since 1970, and there have been significant developments in services since then, with a growing emphasis on delivery of care in a community rather than institutional setting.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1898">I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">The HSE plans to recruit a General Manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospitals, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital. The recruitment of a General Manager with responsibility for the three hospitals involves the expansion of the current post of General Manager at Galway University Hospitals. This is designed to improve management processes, promote good co-ordination between hospitals and to improve services for patients. The development is not about downgrading any hospital or reducing its service.  It is in line with the greater collaboration between Roscommon and Portiuncula in the provision of services that has been taking place over recent years, for example, in the re-configuration that is underway of the surgical and anaesthetic departments of the two hospitals into a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">The appointment of a General Manager with responsibility for the three hospitals concerned is also in line with the approach on the governance of acute hospitals recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority's Report on Quality and Safety of Services at the Mid Western Regional Hospital Ennis, which was published in April 2009.  This report identified the importance of integrated governance across hospital networks as an important way to ensure higher quality services for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">The HSE is committed to full engagement with all stakeholders in relation to the General Manager post. The final interviews for the General Manager post will not be held until the competition to appoint a Regional Director of Operations in HSE West is concluded. This means that the Regional Director can take an active part in the selection process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">I attended a meeting with HSE, hospital staff and union representatives on  the 19th February 2010 at Portiuncula Hospital at which the HSE plan was discussed. The HSE gave an assurance to staff and union representatives at the meeting that the Executive would arrange a meeting to discuss the context of the appointment of the General Manager. I understand that the HSE has contacted the unions to make the necessary arrangements in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">I am satisfied that the plan to recruit a General Manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospitals, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital will enhance the capacity for collaboration in service provision, will provide a more strategic approach to the management of the hospitals concerned and will ensure the provision of better and safer services to the people of the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1908">The Government has approved my proposal to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution under the GMS and community drugs schemes. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement price for groups of substitutable drugs. This will promote price competition in the Irish market and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">A working group, comprising of officials from my Department and the HSE, and chaired by Mr Mark Moran, is setting out proposed steps for implementing this initiative. I expect to see significant progress on this in 2010, including the identification and implementation of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect from the start of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">Reference pricing will deliver direct savings by limiting reimbursement to the level of the lowest priced product within a reference group. Indirect savings will also occur as a result of increased price competition. The level of savings will depend upon a range of factors. These include the number and type of products included in reference groups, the relative and absolute prices of products within reference groups and the market response for each reference group. The working group is considering all of these factors and will recommend a model that will deliver value for money and ensure continuity of supply of medicines. It is anticipated that reference pricing will be initially targeted at high volume products that have the potential to achieve significant savings. It is also of strategic importance that this model is in place as a significant number of drugs are due to come off patent in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1914">The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme. Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St. James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project agreements have been signed for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James's projects. Planning permission has been granted for the first three of these projects. Planning permission has been granted by the local authority for the St James's project  The grant of planning  has recently been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.   Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The HSE is required to undertake a rigorous value for money assessment of each co-location project. Projects, in order to proceed, must meet a rigorous value for money test which accords with a Public Sector Benchmark. This test is then verified by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) which acts as advisor to the Department of Health and Children. The HSE and NDFA have confirmed that the tenders received for the six projects where preferred bidders have been selected accorded with the Public Sector Benchmark.  As they proceed the projects  must continue to demonstrate value for money. There is a requirement on each of the preferred bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.   The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">The Finance Act 2009 provides for the termination of the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  This includes co-location projects should they wish to arrange their financing on the basis of the capital allowances scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">No tax expenditure has been incurred so far and none will be incurred until construction is completed and services are opened. The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure.  I would add that additional revenues will accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">Under the Project Agreements agreed with the HSE, the land on which the Hospitals will be built by the successful bidders, are subject to a 65-year lease from the State at full market value. The intention is that no land will be sold to the successful bidders. This efficient utilization of public resources means that the State will receive an income for land over the 65 year period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1927">I wish to advise the Deputy that, due to public service industrial action involving members of IMPACT, the Department has not been in a position to obtain current information from the HSE in relation to delayed discharge numbers in the acute hospital system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">The HSE has taken a series of steps across the health system to shift the balance of care from acute hospitals to community based alternatives and to improve the way in which hospitals operate.  These steps include the development of more enhanced community based services, Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, Rapid Access Clinics, Home Helps and Home Care Packages.  The actions are designed to provide care for patients outside the acute setting where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">The National Code of Practice for Integrated Discharge Planning was introduced last year to target difficulties in the discharge of patients from an acute setting.  It will be accompanied by significant changes to internal hospitals processes, work practices and behaviours.  Those changes will involve developing the role of nursing in supporting more efficient processes at ward and overall bed management level and improving patient flow in, through and out of the hospital system.  The Code also requires changes in clinical practice in terms of scheduling ward rounds to facilitate appropriate and timely clinical review of all patients, seven-day discharging, improving access to senior clinicians, improved tracking and follow up of tests and procedures and improving communication between teams and with patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">Since the introduction last year of Fair Deal, the Nursing Home Support Scheme, there is no longer an incentive for patients in hospital following completion of the acute phase of their treatment to seek a publicly funded long-term care bed as opposed to a bed in the private sector.  A person will make the same contribution towards their care costs, based on an ability to pay, regardless of whether they enter a public or private long-term care facility.  At my request, the HSE has streamlined the administrative process for dealing with applications under the Fair Deal so that patients' discharge to a suitable long-stay facility is not delayed unnecessarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">The HSE Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care will be establishing Clinical care programmes in key health service areas with national clinical leadership. These programmes will have a significant focus on increasing the efficiency of hospital bed use by moving care out into the community, same day admission and increasing day case care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2011">Following the publication of an advertisement in the national press the Department received 127 expressions of interest in relation to membership of the restructured Board of FÁS.  The advertisement set out the criteria required for suitable applicants.  Specifically, to qualify for appointment, a person must not have had any conflicts of interest likely to interfere with his/her ability to play a full part on the Board.  Furthermore, a person must have had possession of expertise and experience at a senior level in one or more of the following areas: the functions of FÁS, or finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2012">A selection team comprising officials from my Department and an official from the Public Appointments Service was put in place.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2017">I can advise the Deputy that my Department does not have on record an application for statutory redundancy in relation to the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  Statutory Redundancy is an employment right, and is available to any employee over the age of 16 who is a class A contributor in insurable employment for two years prior to the date of termination.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum of €600 gross weekly pay.  A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and to submit to my Department an application form (RP50) completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and employee.  This form can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  Disputes in relation to statutory redundancy entitlement can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">If it is the case that the individual considers that an entitlement to statutory redundancy exists and he has sought and been refused statutory redundancy, it might be prudent at this stage for the individual concerned to bring an appeal for a determination in his favour directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).  It is important to note that an employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing his employment, though the EAT has the power to extend the deadline from 52 weeks to 104 weeks.  The 52 week deadline applies both to the making of a claim to the employer and to the making of a claim to the EAT in a situation where the employer disputes payment of redundancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">A claim can be made to the EAT by submitting a form called a T1-A directly to the Tribunal.  These forms can be obtained from the EAT website http://www.eatribunal.ie.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2022">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">I can confirm that my Department has received four statutory lump sum claims in respect of former employees of the company concerned over the period July 2009 to February, 2010 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">I understand that all outstanding queries raised with the employer in relation to the claims have now been resolved and that payment is expected to issue in relation to three of the four claims over the next one to two weeks.  Payment of the claim in respect of one individual not due to terminate employment until towards the end of March cannot be processed at this point but will be paid out after the date of termination of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">In relation to the Insolvency Payments Scheme which is operated under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 and administered by my Department, this provides for the payment of certain wage-related entitlements where an employee's employment is terminated as a result of the employer's insolvency.  These entitlements include arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay, minimum notice, etc.  However, claims under the Scheme can only be processed if a company is formally insolvent within the definition of the Act and a "relevant officer" — normally a receiver or liquidator — has been appointed and certifies the claims.  To date, my Department has not received any claims under the Scheme from the company in question but, as the Deputy has pointed out, given that the company is neither in liquidation or receivership, claims under the Scheme could not be processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">Where a company has made employees redundant and has not paid them their outstanding Holiday Pay and Minimum Notice, the employee may refer a complaint against that company to a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">A complaint to the Rights Commissioner Service may be made by giving them notice of it in writing on the appropriate form.  The form is available from the Rights Commissioner Service or from Information Services in the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  Such a complaint must be made within a period of 6 months beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates.  If the Rights Commissioner is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances s/he may decide to extend the period for up to a further 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">The employees also have a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 11 November, 2008 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2036">In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim.  In this case, adequate supporting documentation from the employer was not submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2037">In the absence of the necessary documentation being submitted, the employee was advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">I am advised that the individual lodged a claim with the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) on 17 September, 2009 to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy against his former employer.  If a positive determination is given by the EAT in this case, my Department will be able to make payment directly to the employee concerned shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">I understand however that in relation to the area concerned in the case of this individual, there is currently a 45-week waiting period for EAT hearings.  Given this backlog of cases pending, it is estimated that a hearing in this case should take place in late August or early September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2040">The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent, quasi-judicial body under the aegis of my Department.  Secretarial and administrative support is provided by Departmental staff.  I understand that the number of claims to the Tribunal up to December 2009, compared with the same period last year, has doubled.  Additional administrative resources have been allocated to the Tribunal to help it process claims.  I will be keeping the matter under review and will take further action if possible within the constraints which exist in relation to resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2139">As a result the total number of nursing undergraduates currently in training is approximately 7,000. My Department and the HSE, in co-operation with relevant stakeholders, is initiating a review of different aspects of the undergraduate nursing degree programme and its findings will inform the future direction of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">By international standards Ireland has a high number of nurses graduating each year. In fact the O.E.C.D. (Health at a Glance 2009) indicates that Ireland at 32.5 is close to the OECD average of 35.5 nursing graduates per 100,000 population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">In comparison to many other countries, Ireland has a relatively high ratio of nurses to population. Compared to others, Ireland has relatively fewer nursing assistants or health care assistants working with nurses. If we can achieve a more efficient and effective use of the nursing resource through advanced practice, improved skill mix and more flexible and efficient rostering this would impact on the projected nursing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">The planned reconfiguration of many of HSE's front line services will also be of assistance in this regard. This reconfiguration includes conversion of in-patient work to day-care work, focusing on reducing patient length of stay in acute hospitals, reducing in-patient bed numbers and providing more services in community settings thus reducing dependency on in-patient beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">In recent years much progress has been made in the better utilisation of the nursing resource and a number of initiatives have been introduced which facilitate nurses and midwives expanding their roles and improving the services provided to patients and clients. I have amended the relevant legislation and introduced new regulations to allow for the introduction of nurse and midwife prescribing. Currently approximately 400 nurses and midwives have commenced or completed the education programme for nurse and midwife prescribing. These programmes are conducted in University College Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. There are currently 154 registered Nurse/Midwife Prescribers from a diversity of health service providers and clinical areas throughout the Health Service Executive with the authority to prescribe medicinal products.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">I have introduced the necessary regulation to authorise nurses to refer an individual for medical ionising radiation (X-Ray). The introduction of this expanded practice for nurses is a significant initiative in the Irish health service and will have implications for service users in terms of convenience, cost-effectiveness, improved access to radiology services and simplification of the patient journey.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">The continuous development of Advanced Nurse Practitioner posts (121 approved) and Clinical Specialist posts (2066 approved) to meet specific service needs in the nursing and midwifery disciplines are further examples of developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">A small, but extremely significant development in the better utilisation of nurses is the new role nurses are playing in Sexual Assault Treatment Units (SATU).<b> </b>Eight nurses have successfully completed the Higher Diploma in Nursing -Sexual Assault Forensic Examination programme<b>.</b>  These nurses are now working in their sponsoring SATU areas providing holistic care and undertaking the clinical forensic examination of  the victims of sexual assault. This work was previously only undertaken by doctors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Another example of the new and more effective use of the nursing and midwifery resource is the key role that a large number of nurses and midwives are playing in the administration of the H1N1 vaccine in the current Swine Flu vaccination campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">I regard nursing and midwifery as key elements of our health services and I am currently finalising a new nurses and midwives Bill.  This will not only recognise midwifery as a separate and distinct profession but will modernise the regulatory framework for these professions and align it to the frameworks governing other health care professions.  The new legislation will enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with the professions and ensure the integrity of nursing and midwifery through the continued promotion of high standards of professional education, training and practice and professional conduct.</p>

            <p eId="para_2151">In addition, the Health Information and Quality Authority, which was established in 2007, carried out a National Hygiene Services Quality Review which assessed 50 acute hospitals against the National Quality Hygiene Standards in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the Authority continued to monitor compliance with their Standards and this included a number of  unannounced visits to randomly selected acute hospitals with this series of inspections focusing specifically on the day to day delivery of hygiene services, particularly in the areas of cleanliness, hand hygiene and waste and linen management practices.   This work was primarily carried out by staff of the Authority. These staff work on a range of programmes and activities and costs relating to this aspect of their work is not separately recorded but the costs are included in the overall expenditure of the Authority. As a result, it is not possible to provide the full cost of the Authority's reviews of hygiene in public hospitals.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_757">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2186">The purpose of the Economic &amp; Tourism Development Plan for the Shannon Airport catchment area was to present a focused Action Plan to assist the airport and the wider Mid-west region to adapt to new circumstances brought about by the phasing out of the Shannon stop rule, under the EU-US Open Skies Agreement, and the withdrawal by Aer Lingus its Shannon-Heathrow service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">Significant progress has been made since the report was published in January 2008. Aer Lingus has reinstated its Shannon-Heathrow service and daily connectivity from Shannon to the US has been maintained, despite the ending of the Shannon-stop rule and the dramatic fall in consumer demand for air travel generally in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">Last year, US pre-clearance facilities were established at the airport for commercial air carriers. Shannon is the only airport in the world outside of the Americas offering these facilities. Preclearance of U.S. bound private aircraft commenced on 1 March 2010. This development has the potential to deliver significant new business for Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">A key component of the Shannon Economic and Tourism Development Plan is a focused tourism-marketing programme introduced by the Minister for Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism to promote the wider Shannon catchment area. I understand that Tourism Ireland, the body with responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination, continues to engage in cooperative marketing campaigns with air carriers to promote ease of access and to stimulate demand for travel to the Shannon region from key source markets. The "Discover Ireland's Wonderful West" campaign was commenced in 2008 on foot of the Shannon Economic and Tourism Development Plan and highlights the attractions of the western region and good value packages on offer. I am advised that €3 million was provided specifically for this purpose in 2008 with a further €2.05 million spent on the campaign in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">I am also advised that the 2010 Budget of the Department of Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism includes €4.9 million for regional tourism marketing campaigns including additional funding provision for the promotion of the wider Shannon Airport Catchment, over and above the funding for promotion of the regions generally. The detail of the marketing activity for the wider Shannon Airport Catchment is being finalised by Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">Under the Plan the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism asked Fáilte Ireland to arrange an objective and independent study of the feasibility of a regional conference centre for the Shannon region. Indecon Consultants carried out the study which was submitted to Fáilte Ireland and was subsequently presented to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">The report concluded that the case for a regional conference centre in the Shannon/Limerick area is subject to considerable uncertainty and is marginal at best. Having examined the report, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism agreed with its findings and the report was subsequently made available on the Fáilte Ireland website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">Regarding tourism development generally, Shannon Development, as the regional tourism authority for the Shannon region, continues to work closely with Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to ensure that tourism in the Shannon region grows to the maximum extent. In addition Fáilte Ireland provides a range of business supports and training which are available to tourism enterprises in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">The Economic and Tourism Development Plan also highlighted a number of Road Investment projects for the region. As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, including those listed the Shannon Economic and Tourism Development Plan, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">Once the Major Interurban Routes, which includes the M7 Dublin/Limerick motorway, are completed by the end of 2010, the NRA will focus on the completion of the Atlantic Road Corridor (ARC). The ARC will run from Letterkenny to Cork and Waterford via Limerick. The Ennis bypass forms part of this route and was completed in early 2008.  The Crusheen to Gort phase is under construction at present. Further details are available from the NRA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">Construction of the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor (Ennis-Athenry) has been completed and services are scheduled to commence at the end this month.</p>

In this Resolution, the Special Committee on Decolonization called for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the sovereignty dispute and expressed regret that implementation of Resolutions adopted by the Committee in the past had not started in spite of widespread international support for negotiations between the two Governments.

Only modest investments were made in its upkeep over the years and it had long been in need of substantial refurbishment. In 2006, my Department was advised that total renovation was required to address a wide range of serious structural and maintenance issues. Some of these problems were aggravated by the long term cumulative impact of the severe local climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">A number of extensions to the property were found to be structurally flawed and had to be demolished and replaced. Large quantities of asbestos were discovered in the building and all services including electrical, heating and air conditioning had to be renewed or upgraded to conform to contemporary local legal codes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">The alternatives, including relocation, were examined. However, the necessary renovations mitigated against the sale of the property. It was concluded that refurbishment and retention was the most cost effective option.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">The decision was taken to renovate and upgrade the property so it could serve as a multi-purpose "Ireland House" type amenity to enhance the Embassy's capacity to promote all aspects of Ireland especially trade and culture and provide conference and presentation facilities for use by State Agencies, Irish companies and artists. The majority of the space is used for representational and support services. The Ambassador's personal living quarters occupy only a relatively limited area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">The renovated premises represent a valuable asset for the State and a resource in the consolidation and enhancement of our important relationship with Canada with whom we have many shared foreign policy values. It is the world's seventh largest economy and a member of the G8. Ireland is currently the fifth largest recipient of Canadian outward investment and Canada is a growing market for Irish companies. Our merchandise exports there increased by 12% in 2009 despite the economic downturn. Some 4 million Canadians (12% of the population) claim Irish descent.</p>

            <p eId="para_2264">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 221 of 10 February 2010. I have had no discussions with the local development company in question, although I have met with the community development project (CDP) referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">As I have previously stated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected. Under the new Local and Community Development Programme, local development companies will be able to identify and respond to the needs of communities and I have asked that particular attention be given to RAPID areas and to those areas where a CDP is no longer operating.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">My Department has indicated that, if the CDP referred to decides to cease operations and to wind-up, my Department will, without prejudice, seek to assist the directors in discharging their statutory responsibilities, subject to the financial and regulatory limitations applicable to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">With regard to business continuity issues for CDP activities in the Dublin 24 area, it would be a matter for the boards of management of the local groups in question to discuss this in the first instance.  My Department will, subject to resources, endeavour to be as supportive as possible in relation to any decisions made between the CDP board and the board of the local development company regarding the maintenance of key front-line services and supports in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2269">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund exists to support workers who lose their jobs as a result of changing global trade patterns or the global economic and financial crisis so that they can be prepared to find another job as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">An application was made by Ireland, and recently approved by EU, in the context of the Dell redundancies in Raheen, Co. Limerick. It is estimated that up to 2,900 workers are involved when qualifying downstream companies affected by this closure are included and a combined total of €2.8 million is available, between EU and Government funding, to provide complementary retraining, upskilling, entrepreneurial support s and educational opportunities for the relevant workers. The allocated funding will be available for spending until September 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">Under the terms associated with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), it is not envisaged in general that any monies from the fund will be paid directly to former Dell workers. Therefore, the social welfare entitlements of the former workers will not be affected as no money will be directly received. Instead funding is being channelled through the relevant State agencies and educational institutions to deliver the required supports to eligible redundant workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">Workers who were made statutorily redundant from Dell may retain their jobseeker's payments while attending education or training courses under the terms of the Back to Education schemes operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. BTEA participants attending an approved full-time course can keep their jobseeker's payments for the duration of that course (which may be a number of years). Those who participate in an approved part-time course can receive welfare support for as long as they would ordinarily be entitled to a jobseeker's payment (9-12 months in the case of those on Jobseeker's Benefit, or longer for those who qualify for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance). These provisions equally apply to workers studying HETAC or FETAC accredited third level courses at private colleges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the responsible authority for making EGF applications and drawing down EU funding. That department is also working with FÁS to make a range of programmes available to the former Dell employees. The package of programmes is currently being finalised. Department of Social and Family Affairs officials are involved at central and local level these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_2289">Social welfare legislation specifically directs the deciding officer, in determining a question of habitual residence, to "take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following:</p>

The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition".</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">The guidelines do not attempt to be prescriptive as to how each individual factor affects the overall conclusion because the circumstances that apply to different cases will be very varied. Similarly the list of questions or elements provided in the guidelines to be considered in relation to the various factors are intended to be assistive and not exhaustive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">In the case of a person returning to Ireland after a period of residence abroad, the guidelines do not require the deciding officer to determine whether the person was habitually resident in Ireland or not before going abroad. As my previous answer indicated, the fact or duration of previous residence does not of itself determine whether a person's return is temporary or whether their intention is now to establish habitual residence in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The information sought from an applicant who has returned to the State will include such elements as: how long they were previously resident here, why they left, how long they lived in various countries abroad and why they lived there, why they have returned, and whether they own property in Ireland or abroad. It is generally found that this information is sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether their present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.</p>

            <p eId="para_2334">The Deserted Wife's Benefit is a payment issued to a woman who has been deserted by her husband.  Entitlement to the payment is based on the social insurance contributions paid by the woman or by her husband.  The scheme was closed off to new applications with effect from 2 January, 1997, when the One-Parent Family Payment was introduced.  Thereafter, both lone parents and deserted wives with qualified children came to be supported under the One-Parent Family Payment, with the resultant increases in income limits being focused on this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">No income disregard applies to persons in receipt of the Deserted Wife's Benefit who registered their claim on or before 30 August, 1992.  The Social Welfare Act, 1992, introduced an income disregard for entitlement to the payment for new applicants from 31 August, 1992.  The principal reason for introducing this income disregard was that resources would be more effectively targeted towards those deserted wives who required an additional supplement to their income up until the time when they would be able to support themselves.  This is consistent with other social insurance payments that seek to support claimants during short-term periods of unemployment and/or illness.  With the exception of those recipients of the Deserted Wife's Benefit who first claimed the payment prior to 31 August, 1992, the only social insurance payments that are long-term in nature are to those people who are unable to return to work either through retirement or through prolonged disability or illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">The income disregard is the main component of the employment support policy both for those in receipt of the Deserted Wife's Benefit and for those in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">The current income disregard for the Deserted Wife's Benefit is €20,000.  This limit was brought into effect from 3 May, 2007, and represents a substantial increase on the previous income disregard whereby claimants who were earning more than €12,697 per annum received a reduced payment and claimants who were earning more than €17,776 lost their entitlement to the payment altogether.  The current arrangement effectively allows recipients of the Deserted Wife's Benefit to earn up to €384 per week and still retain full entitlement to a maximum benefit of €201.50 if aged under 66 years and of €230.30 if aged 66 years or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">Recipients of the Deserted Wife's Benefit whose annual income exceeds €20,000 are also entitled to a half-rate transitional payment for a period of six months and may be eligible for further financial support through the Family Income Supplement scheme thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2368">In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  These include —</p>
            <p eId="para_2369">the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure;</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than educational facilities, child care facilities or hospitals).</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">The above exemptions are conditional on, among other things, the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of the antennae.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures in 1996.  The guidelines are intended to facilitate planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with these developments within the planning system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">The guidelines set out a locational hierarchy in relation to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within, or in the immediate surrounds of, smaller towns or villages as a last resort.  If such a location should become necessary, masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location. In the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land.   The guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools. Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any Ministerial guidelines, in the performance of their functions.   The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie.</i>

            <p eId="para_2389">I presume that the Deputy is referring to EU requirements for the mandatory introduction of Electronic Identification (EID) in sheep.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">I have secured major concessions in relation to EID in discussions with the European Commission.  These concessions include a slaughter derogation, which means that all lambs intended for slaughter, and less than 12 months are now permanently exempted from EID. This will result in EID being largely confined to replacement breeding stocks that are born after 31 December 2009. This means the vast majority of Irish sheep will be excluded from EID requirements, which will minimise costs for producers. In fact, EID will apply to no more than 18% of the national flock (450,000 — 550,000).  Some 70% of flocks are 100 sheep or less and in these cases less than 20 animals will be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The Deputy should note that farmers will not be required to purchase readers since, as is the case at present, an ear tag will continue to have a number on it that is readable to the human eye so there will be minimal change to current practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">Our existing system has up until now provided adequate assurances in terms of animal identification and traceability.   Indeed, it is partly with that in mind that I have decided to minimise the impact on farmers by confining electronic tagging to mainly breeding sheep.  I am also striving however to minimise the change to the existing National Sheep Identification System (NSIS). My Department has circulated a technical document outlining the proposed changes to the NSIS to farm organisations and other stakeholders for comments.  My officials are consulting them with a view to ensuring that whatever revisions are made to the existing NSIS best suit Irish conditions and minimise the burden on farmers within the parameters of the new legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2394">As part of the reorganisation of my Department's national network of local offices it is intended that the Mallow and South Mall offices in Cork City will be closed. The work from these offices will transfer to a new office to be located in North County Cork area once a suitable location has been identified. The Office of Public Works together with my Department is examining various options. No date has yet been scheduled for this transfer to take place.</p>
