          <p eId="para_10">I welcome everyone to this meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs at which we will continue our hearings on tackling childhood obesity. We will hear a presentation by a representative of the GAA, Gaelic Athletic Association. I welcome its community and health manager, Mr. Colin Regan, whom I thank for coming before us. I also welcome members of the committee and viewers who might be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I remind members and delegates to, please, switch off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting. Television coverage and web streaming can also be adversely affected. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> I advise Mr. Regan that any submission or opening statement he has submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting. After his presentation there will be a quick question and answer session. I call on him to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Colin Regan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">Thank you, Chairman. Since the inception of the GAA in 1884, we have been concerned with the health and well-being of the people and the nation. In a modern Ireland the association has worked tirelessly to respond to the ever-changing needs of our members and the communities we serve. This may present in providing new and interesting ways for young people to enjoy physical activity which we know supports their health and well-being, particularly when it comes to being overweight or obesity, or providing safe environments that help to support their social and emotional development. In providing part of the solution to the childhood obesity challenge facing Ireland the GAA takes an holistic approach to well-being, recognising that our members’ physical, emotional and social health needs are interrelated and linked.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> We have endless reports telling us that children are failing to meet the recommended physical activity levels, both at home and in the formal education setting. We have similar reports highlighting the explosion in childhood obesity levels, coupled with increased consumption of energy-dense foods by children and adults alike. We know and see the personal and societal consequences of this shift in lifestyle behaviours which are exacerbated by conditions in the society in which we live - health inequalities, access to relatively cheap convenience foods, sedentary lifestyles and powerful marketing and promotion by big business.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Any attempt to address the consequences of the obesogenic environment in which much of modern society operates requires a multifaceted, all-of-Government, all-of-society response. The GAA proudly plays its part by helping swathes of our juvenile population achieve their recommended weekly physical activity levels, while exposing them to positive values, experiences, habits and role models that scaffold them on their journey through life.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The 2017 GAA games development and research report highlights current participation levels in the various games development activities undertaken and outlines proposals for future initiatives that will further increase participation. The highlights from 2017 can be summarised as follows: 142,467 participants on Kellogg’s GAA Cúl Camps - an increase of 11.5% on 2016 - making it the biggest child sport promotion in the world with 20% of all children of that age in the country; approximately 189,842 primary school pupils participating in the Hurling Go Games blitz programmes, with 217,532 pupils playing in five or more Gaelic Football Go Games blitzes, outside their traditional training with their clubs twice a week; more than 250,000 primary school pupils receiving coaching as part of a primary schools coaching programme; the total number of players participating in a Go Games blitz programme nationwide amounting to approximately 77,626 children; the launch of GAA fun and run, which is designed to provide access to our games for persons with special needs and disabilities and is primed to optimise participation within multi-ethnic and lower socioeconomic demographics; and the launch of the GAA five-star centres to significant acclaim from the INTO and teacher training colleges because of their potential to increase levels of physical activity through the medium of Gaelic games in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In addition to our traditional games-based models, the GAA has broken new ground in its efforts to equip our members and communities with the opportunities to enjoy healthier lifestyles with the introduction of the healthy club project in partnership with Healthy Ireland, the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and supported by Irish Life through a CSR funding partnership. This award-winning project, which has been heralded at European level through a joint initiative of nine sporting organisations across nine EU countries called Sports Clubs for Health, uses an evidence-based approach that has been independently evaluated by a team from Waterford Institute of Technology's behavioural health research department. It has been successful in delivering health-promoting programmes, policies and partnerships to young and old through the medium of their local GAA club. The model is based on the WHO's approach to health promotion, which targets the setting in which we live, work, play and learn rather than targeting individuals or specific health issues. We believe that, with additional support, this project has the potential to deliver a healthier Ireland, one that engages and excites people, offering access to evidence-based health interventions and resources in a new way but through a trusted and traditional setting and one that is available in every community in Ireland - your local GAA Healthy Club.</p>

          <from> Mr. Colin Regan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_22">Its origins are the clubs themselves, which asked us for support relating to issues such as healthy eating, physical activity for non-playing members, emotional well-being of members, gambling, drug and alcohol education, and community development. Those areas primarily focused on clubs reaching out to their older members and providing access to games for non-traditional cohorts, such as persons with special needs or the new Irish. At present, we are in phase 3 with 150 clubs participating, including several in each county, and we are only limited by resources. We want to reach all 1,600 clubs this year and, having invited expressions of interest in January, we had 220 applications. We only had the capacity to take in 92, however, adding to the 58 that concluded phase 2. There is great hunger for this and we deliver a two and a half hour training module, developed in consultation with our partners in the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and Healthy Ireland, to all participating clubs. The same training is available to any other of the 150 clubs which are not in the evaluation model. Last year we trained 400 GAA healthy club officers throughout the country, whose clubs are interested in getting involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> On healthy eating, I am aware that Amanda McCloat from St. Angela's home economics teacher training college was here. With Amanda and her team, and Dr. Crionna Tobin, a leading sports nutritionist, we developed a programme called Recipes for Success, targeting minor and under 21 panels. We have a fantastic booklet with healthy recipes based on whole foods, endorsed by some of our intercounty stars. These not only support a healthier diet but also boost performance. The local healthy club reaches out to the home economics teacher training college and the teacher gives them a two-hour cookery demonstration class, in their own time as volunteers, in which they take the panel through at least two recipes. They are at a critical juncture in their life development as many are finishing their leaving certificate and going on to third level or apprenticeships. The classes arm them with an interest in nutrition and the skills to cook the healthy food that will boost their lifestyles and, it is hoped, even make them better players.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I acknowledge the hard work the GAA does. We had the féile at the weekend in Galway and it was a magnificent weekend, much of which is down to Damien Coleman, the development officer in the area. I have enjoyed Cúl Camps for the past three years and I have three kids participating. When the two younger children, who are girls, get to sixth class, however, it stops. In Portumna we are trying to get to 120 and all clubs try to increase their numbers. Is the organisation trying to expand the age range or to put on a separate week for teenagers? The GAA does good work for the under 16 camogie girls in helping with their diet and so on but I would love it to be part of the Cúl Camp week, particularly for teenagers. Is any development work being done on that? If the GAA wants to do a pilot, I ask it to come our way as we would be delighted to take it on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Teenage girls are an issue for me. Mr. Regan said Go Games was non-competitive for under 12s.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_10">
          <from> Mr. Colin Regan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>

          <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">After that, the gloves come off and everything is competitive, but we lose a lot of people very quickly when that happens. How is the training of management and coaches organised? We need to balance competitiveness and participation. I am delighted the GAA fun and run includes children of all abilities. The perception in the past was that if a person had any inability, the gate was not open to them. Mentors, the management and officers need training in inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I am the chair of the local camogie club and I cannot see any rules about minimum participation. That was what was beautiful about the féile. One had the opportunity to play for 30 minutes. Everybody should get 30 minutes but how is the GAA going to write such a thing into its policies, at least at minor level, and have participation?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">If we have participation and training two evenings a week, then we will have active children. They will not be sedentary. It will also bring in diet. People from a local gym in my area, the Engine Room, spoke to our girls who are under 14 about diet and things such as the importance of breakfast. We could channel that through the local camogie club. The organisation is wonderful but we need to move past those aged 12 years because the problem is those aged 16 years. What are the GAA's plan for this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_12">
          <from> Mr. Colin Regan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">The Deputy has made a good point. The drop-off is not only happening with teenage girls but everyone at that age, and it is across all codes. We have introduced several initiatives that attempt to address that. The Deputy is correct that the competitive element turns off some young people at that critical stage in their development. When the Deputy has a chance, she might read the full submission. In recent years the games development department has introduced super games centres which are non-competitive centres. These are ongoing rather than summer-based, like the Cúl Camps, but they are their equivalent and target that teenage cohort, both male and female, to offer them the opportunity to come together in a non-competitive environment. It was only introduced in 2015, when there were only ten centres throughout the country. That grew to 115 in 2016 and 793 of our clubs last year, almost half the clubs in the country, plus 381 post-primary schools engaged in at least three sessions exploring the concept of this super games centre. It is driven by the young people themselves, rather than having a formal coaching-driven ethos. The intention is for young people to come together and formalise and regulate their games, with fun and participation at the core rather than competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On where we move after the Cúl Camp philosophy, the intention of the Go Games was that the volunteer coaches who put in so much time have realised that it is not necessary to introduce competitions to young people because they will find the level of competition they want themselves. Any player pathway in any sports organisation must have an element of competition to allow for those who are striving towards being the best athletes or players that they can be in their code. There has to be a pathway for elite players and that is the intercounty championships in the GAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> We feel the Healthy Clubs project is an antidote, as it were, to the win at all costs ethos that, unfortunately, can permeate all sports. It is detrimental to the children but is driven by the adults. The Healthy Club project exposes children to nutritional advice, recommendations and best practice. During phase 2, 60 clubs participated and more than half engaged in the Recipes for Success programme. In addition to the partnership with St. Angela's, those clubs then adopted healthy eating guidelines. When I was playing, traditionally it would have been the practice to be given a packet of crisps and a fizzy drink after playing. Now they are given a bottle of water and fruit.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">It does, of course, but it will take a couple of generations to change that ethos and to reassure clubs that once the changes are made, it becomes the norm. It has been embraced by the young people throughout the country. For instance, St. Finbarr's in Cork, one of our leading healthy clubs, has entered into a very interesting partnership with the local SuperValu to provide the fruit and vegetables and bottles of water for the club's nurseries every Saturday morning. It is win-win. It has cost the club nothing, the local business gets positive promotion and the adults and parents are very grateful to the club for taking this positive step. It requires a bit of thinking outside the box along with proper policy and support and the provision of guidelines from the national level down.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> On the Deputy's second point about the fun and run and providing access for people who might not traditionally see themselves as a county star or be able to engage in games in their local club because of any special needs they might have, be they intellectual, physical or sensory, we are driving the implementation of the fun and run through the healthy club model. For instance, Raheny in north Dublin has a Raheny all-stars programme every Saturday morning. The Central Remedial Clinic is in its catchment area so Raheny has a large population base that can benefit from this targeted approach to people who want to engage in physical activity. We know from research that people with special needs are a particular at-risk group for obesity and being overweight because the standard physical activity opportunities are excluded to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">There is a healthy club in every county and the scheme is open to any club that is interested. We welcome expressions of interest from any club. It is an adapted version of rounders. I expect we have all played rounders in our youth and enjoyed it. Instead of the throw, which can limit some people, the ball is on a tee. It is wheelchair-friendly. Each station around the pitch has a little mat and one must engage in an exercise which promotes the fundamental movements. If one turns the mat over, there is also a wheelchair-friendly exercise. When we launched it on the grounds in Trinity College Dublin last year, some of the pupils from the Central Remedial Clinic came down. The great thing was that those who might not have been physically able to swing a bat had special needs assistants or family member, often a parent or sibling out getting their exercise with his or her child, as part of the game. It is very family-friendly and also special needs adapted.</p>

          <p eId="para_49"> This does not relate directly to minors, but when I was a councillor and involved in a club, an issue that arose was the space which the bar occupies within the club. This comes to mind in the context of drinks, fizzy drinks and packets of crisps after matches. The space that the bar occupies is a financial resource for clubs, it has been good to me as an artist and musician and serves as a social space. Is the GAA conscious of the space that it occupies? Looking a generation ahead, is it something that Mr. Regan thinks might change? Will we move away from a connection with pubs and alcohol? We are working on obesity and childhood obesity. Senator Noone and others have done great work on the alcohol Bill. We are doing ongoing work on smoking. Does Mr. Regan see that, over a generation, there will be a disconnection?</p>

          <p eId="para_50">It is happening. Only a tiny percentage of GAA clubs have bars. I am from County Leitrim where none of the clubs has a bar. They would be largely urban-based clubs. I imagine that less than 5% of 1,600 clubs have a bar attached to them. I will find out the exact number and share it with the committee. In 2006, the GAA introduced its alcohol and substance abuse prevention programme in partnership with the HSE. At the time, Ireland was among the highest consumers of alcohol in the OECD.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Since then, more than 750 GAA clubs have introduced an alcohol and substance abuse prevention policy. During my childhood, after an underage match we would be brought into the local pub for sandwiches. After every county final, the pub was where the medals were handed out. That idea or association has been completely broken. The GAA sample club drug and alcohol abuse policy clearly indicates that no juvenile events should even take place in the local premises. We do not allow sponsorship of any juvenile teams, gear or equipment by licensed premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> As part of phase 2 of the healthy club project, more than half of the 60 clubs involved became completely smoke-free campuses. More than half of the 150 clubs now in phase 3 have indicated that they will do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> A major cultural shift has been taking place. It comes down to an appreciation that the GAA club is a setting for something beyond the delivery of the skills associated with Gaelic games. It is a setting where people come together as families and as a community to socialise. The idea is that this setting can promote positive health messages in a variety of areas. Clubs are becoming far more mindful of how they can do that. We are fortunate with some of the partnerships we have developed, including with Healthy Ireland, the HSE and the National Office for Suicide Prevention. We have also received support from Irish Life through corporate social responsibility investment. We have been able to development a community and health department in Croke Park that is solely responsible for trying to drive this shift.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> It is also important to note that the association has no alcohol sponsorship at national level. There has been no such arrangement since we parted ways with Guinness as the sponsor of hurling. We are unique in an Irish context in that regard given how large the association is and yet we are in no way dependent on alcohol sponsorship.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I join in welcoming Mr. Regan to the committee today. We have heard of a number of tremendous and positive initiatives. It is good to have crystallisation of what the GAA is doing right down to the local community, because sometimes we think of the GAA in binary terms, whether hurling or football, camogie or handball and so on. Often, we think of the GAA in binary terms and in an intercounty context only. As policymakers we might not fully appreciate what happens across the land except perhaps through the prism of our individual clubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> Given that we are good parochial people, I am keen to hear more about the fun and run activity. My club in Mallow, County Cork, has world-class facilities. We have a multimillion euro facility. It is something that could be used as a hub for the Munster region for outworking in that regard. I would be delighted to work with the GAA on this. We should not simply look at the facility in terms of Mallow but from the Munster or regional perspective given its specific location. Perhaps I will share more with Mr. Regan on that afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> We cannot underestimate the metrics Mr. Regan has given us today. The key metric is the top-line metric, which is a total of 142,467 participants in the Cúl Camps. It is the biggest child sport promotion in the world. That is a phenomenal metric for what is an indigenous sport when we look at it in global terms. We should be shouting that metric from the rooftops. It is testament to the lateral thinking that now exists within the GAA. The GAA sees itself as having a clear social function. The association sees itself as having responsibilities to its community right down to the neighbourhood. Committee members are delighted to hear the metric in the context of our deliberations on tackling obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Does Mr. Regan believe more needs to be done in outreach to primary schools? Are some primary schools not being reached? Is the ability to get in the front door hampered for certain reasons? If so, what are the reasons?</p>

          <p eId="para_63">This is one of the rare times we have this age group captive, for want of a better word. We know that, nowadays, we need to be able to introduce interesting and varied physical activity opportunities for young boys and girls. It might be foolish of me to say it but organised sport is not for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> The GAA works with primary schools. Pat Daly is the head of games development. Deputy Sherlock referred to the metrics that the Cúl Camps have reached. Sligo footballer Charlie Harrison is the national Cúl Camp co-ordinator. He has done extraordinary work on the increase in this area in recent years. The games development department is mindful of providing fundamental movement opportunities for young people in the educational setting, especially primary school. These are not solely GAA-specific. The idea is to engage with them in a way that excites them and gets them moving. This allows them to learn the fundamental and functional movement skills that will support a physical lifestyle throughout their lives. We are not selfish about whether the means are GAA-specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> The games department has introduced a 5 star centre concept. This is in response to the fact that only 18% of primary school pupils are achieving the recommended of 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every week. GAA coaches support schools that take up the challenge and participate in the have a ball programme and the fun and run initiative. It is centred around basic movements such as striking and the catch and kick experience. Those involved get to participate in the Go Games at Cumann na mBunscol level and the Go Games skills challenge as well. Schools that meet all these elements are recognised by the GAA as 5 star centres. We are hoping that this incentive will see an increase in the positive influence that the GAA is having through its network and its links with schools. This is being researched in partnership with DCU moving well-being well programme. We will keep the committee abreast of the findings of that research.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">I have another question on primary schools and how to reach a penetration rate of 100%. Mr. Regan stated that the GAA is willing to reach out into other areas. He referred to the principle of getting basic movements, how the GAA does not claim ownership of this, and how the association is willing to work with others. The committee will have to make recommendations. If Mr. Regan were to make recommendations, is there anything he would recommend by way of an action to try to reach a 100% penetration rate for every school so that every child in the country could hit that target?</p>

          <p eId="para_67">The first step is to identify the current barriers preventing schools from supporting children in reaching the basic requirements of 60 minutes. What are the barriers? Is it is a matter of facilities or the knowledge base among teachers within the school? Is it parents? Is it the fact that not enough coaches from the various national governing bodies are able to cover the required additional support that would raise the level?</p>
          <p eId="para_68">We could adopt a targeted approach to supporting those schools. A number of schools are achieving that target. It is a question of identifying the barriers preventing other schools from achieving what is required, often through the curriculum.</p>

Many studies show that the high sugar and caffeinated nature of those drinks has been associated with sudden cardiac syndrome. There have been some high-profile tragic cases in GAA sports.

It would be great for children to understand at that early age that these types of sugar-laden, high-caffeine drinks besides being an obesity trigger could have detrimental effects on their health.

          <p eId="para_96">During registration is the easiest time to do that. There are two periods of registration for young people with our clubs, first and foremost, when parents register to sign up their children at the start of the year. The clubs, if they have healthy eating guidelines in place, have the opportunity to make the parents aware of that. Most of them will carry information on that on their Facebook page and on their website. Second, we are accessing 142,000 young people every year through our Cúl camps, and that number is increasing year on year. We have introduced healthy eating guidelines on the registration page for parents, outlining what we expect an appropriate healthy lunch to be.</p>

However, the specificity of the five to 12 year old age bracket in the area of nutrition and healthy eating and the sensitivities involved, particularly when speaking to parents about their children on this topic, can be highly emotive.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I will be brief. I thank Mr. Regan for coming in. He has answered many questions that I would have had anyway. I have been listening for the past hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I have nothing but respect for the GAA and what it does through communities. I am a rural Deputy who represents County Limerick. We have many small rural GAA clubs, which are the heart of what happens in the community or the hub, like the schools in the parishes. I want to put on the record I have nothing but the utmost respect for the GAA. I myself used play GAA games.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I have one or two questions. I will take a slightly different view to this. Much has been answered about the younger children. If I diverge slightly from the topic, I ask the Chairman to pull me up on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> My question relates to older children. A child, in legal terms, is under 18. Does Mr. Regan see anything happening around performance enhancing or any of that starting to creep in, particularly for the older children aged 16 or 17, and even players aged 18? What one hears is probably anecdotal. I would be interested in Mr. Regan's comments on that and whether he is starting to see it?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I suppose we are mindful of it. Thankfully, we have not had any notable incidents. However, anybody who uses a gym now in Ireland will see that nearly everybody is walking round with some kind of container with a shake of some form or other in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Our concern is that, at intercounty level, our players are working with dietitians and are exposed to the best possible supplements that have the appropriate contents. When these lads go back to their clubs after a year of conditioning with a dietitian, they are physically transformed and sometimes their clubmates say, "Wow, I need to do whatever he is doing." However, they access the supplements online, which is completely unregulated. It could be coming in from any part of the world and could contain anything. We are concerned about an awareness that anything that one sources should be sourced through an approved dietitian and used with the proper supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> We have national guidelines that no juvenile should use any supplement whatsoever. At that age of their development and the level of sport and training that they should be exposed to, a proper balanced healthy diet is more than enough to provide them with all their nutritional needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">The reason I ask the question is, obviously, at intercounty level, as Mr. Regan says, because the game is getting ever more competitive and ever more professionalised with the level they go to in order to get their fitness up, they are spending more time off-season in the gym and that, obviously, has an influence on the underaged players who look up to the senior players. They want to be that senior player. It might be something we could pop into our report in respect of enhancement. I welcome the fact that the GAA is recognising that and has guidelines on it. It is different. I accept I am moving off obesity slightly but it is in the same vein. I thank Mr. Regan.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">On my own behalf, I thank Mr. Regan for his presentation. No doubt the GAA provides an extraordinary service to the State and has done for generations. This particular venture for the GAA, in terms of healthy eating promotion, is to be welcomed and appreciated. The GAA is in every corner of every county. It has two clubs in some towns. It is fantastic to see such a big organisation take such a lead on it and it is important. There are many other sporting codes that do the same but it should be noted that no other sporting code has the reach that the GAA has.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I will focus on three themes. The first, which is the most important one - because one can have all the Cúl camps in the world but if one does not promote participation, and the sustenance of that participation, we have a problem, and it is the problem that we are facing in this country in terms of obesity rates - is, of course, participation. Our opening speaker, Deputy Rabbitte, touched upon it but it is important to dwell on it for a moment. As somebody who was very good at one particular code and dreadful at most others, I was a willing participant in all sports. On that drop-off in participation, because of the exclusion of individuals, and the competitive nature of sporting organisations, I can speak to one section of my community in Dublin Fingal where there are two other sporting organisations that grew as a result of the exclusion of hundreds of people because of that one organisation - it does not matter what code it is or where it is. The point is there are two other clubs that now have hundreds of members because of this competitive nature and it started at under 12s. That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Senator Richmond made a point yesterday which was covered in the media - I am sure other members have made points about it in the past - that there should be encouragement for children to participate up to a particular age where there should not be competition involved. When I say there should not be competition, they should be given a run at every game or every second game. It is not good enough for a sporting organisation to exclude a child who shows up week in, week out, trains just as hard as everybody else but maybe just does not have that talent or for it, for instance, to encourage him or her to participate in a team that might play once a month. I would be interested to hear Mr. Regan's view on that matter. I am not targeting the GAA at all. It happens right across the spectrum of sporting codes. I would be interested to hear his view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_118">
          <from> Mr. Colin Regan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_161">The GAA's view is exactly the same as the Chairman's. We find that unacceptable. The Go Games philosophy was introduced specifically to address that. The Go Games philosophy requires - it is compulsory for all clubs - that children up to under 14 level enjoy an opportunity. Everybody plays is the philosophy of the Go Games, as we heard from Deputy Rabbitte. Deputy Rabbitte attended the féile hurling in Galway last week and there was a requirement for roll-on, roll-off substitutes for participation in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Unfortunately, there is still a culture driven by some coaches within our clubs where they seek to live vicariously through the underage teams with which they are working.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">We also now have a requirement that all coaches working with juvenile teams in the association receive foundation level coaching. It will take a generation to deliver that cultural and philosophical change but we believe that if every club steps up to the plate and requires every coach to receive that training, which directs them on how to address this challenge, we will see a sea change within the association over the coming years. We are delighted with the fact that, as I mentioned, 220 clubs applied to get involved in the healthy club project. One of their big motivations is to address that kind of culture within their own clubs. We see that project as being a further antidote to the win-at-all-costs ethos that can unfortunately carry across all codes. I played pretty much anything with a ball as I was growing up and I unfortunately experienced that attitude myself. The drop-off rate is one of the factors but the issue is multifaceted. </p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I am excited to hear that, when a club lost those players through bad practice, another club was ready and able to provide something for those young people. It is essential that we have a sufficient network of opportunities for young boys and girls to enjoy physical activity regardless of whether they do so under our own particular code. In fact, I would go further and ask how we imbue a love of not just sporting activity, but activity in general among young people during the formative years of their lives that they will carry right throughout.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">One of the other barriers to participation in sport, which I have unfortunately learned of both as a public representative for the last 14 years and from having witnessed it personally, is competitive behaviour on the touchline, primarily from parents. It can be a bit of an issue. It is a barrier to certain parents returning. In my experience it is especially the case with women bringing their children to GAA games and, indeed, soccer games and things like that. That is my personal experience. If a child is excluded or removed from the pitch or training ground - primarily the pitch because obviously there would not be much competition on a training ground - it is a bit of an issue. Promoting participation should form part of overarching policies within any sporting code. I am sure the GAA has some code in this regard. Perhaps Mr. Regan would like to drill into it.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">We do. I would actually go a little bit further and say that it is a big issue. We introduced the respect initiative in 2009. It outlines the behaviour that is expected on the sidelines in GAA grounds. It has not had the impact we would have hoped that it would have had at this stage. We launched our new strategic plan on Friday which covers 2018 to 2020. It has explicitly called for a rigid implementation of the respect initiative right across the association. Initially it specifically targeted juvenile games. I know I keep returning to the healthy club project. It is great to have a national code but an implementation arm is needed beyond even our traditional network of clubs. We need clubs themselves to show leadership and to say that this is not acceptable within the club. When the 150 clubs signed up at the provincial orientation days last month, they received a welcome pack which included pitchside signage outlining what kind of behaviour is accepted there. At the moment the implementation committee for the new strategic plan is exploring how each of the actions are going to be distributed across the association. I can assure the Chairman that the respect initiative will be getting the kind of support it needs to address that very important issue. The healthy club project has provided an unexpected and very welcome development in that it has opened the door for female leadership within the association. Some 50% of healthy club officers are female and 50% of the members of our national health and well-being committee are female. The Chairman is exactly right. We see that positive influence shining a light on these areas which the more male-dominated attitudes may, perhaps, have overlooked somewhat in previous years.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">On that, and without being 100% serious about it, I am sure there are historic reasons for the fact that camogie is called something different from hurling and that it exists as a name. In terms of participation, is it really necessary?</p>

          <p eId="para_171">Camogie has its own independent association, and proudly so. It is the same case with the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, LGFA. They are sister associations of ours but they are stand-alone associations. We have just signed a memorandum of understanding with both organisations in order to facilitate much closer collaboration and co-operation, particularly in respect of access to pitches, co-ordination of fixtures and so on. I think they would be very proud to maintain and hold their own identities.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">It was just me. Touching on something Senator Noone raised in regard to sugary drinks on the sidelines, the packet of crisps after the game and the discouragement the GAA puts in place through its guidelines, Mr. Regan mentioned that approximately 50% of clubs are involved with those guidelines. He also said that mandatory mechanisms do not work and that promotion does. Is there a point at which he might feel it would be time to say that it should not just be sugary drinks but also high-sugar bars, and energy bars in particular? Is there a tipping point at which the GAA would say that is enough, that players should not have the bag of crisps after the game and that clubs should not be providing them?</p>

          <p eId="para_177">What specifically is classified as confectionery? It is a challenging space because there is a time within club functions, which we have all the time, where it is more than appropriate to provide some confectionery, for example at Christmas gatherings or celebrations. If one has a black and white policy it is a challenge to deal with that. We prefer to show leadership in what is expected in this space. We came to a tipping point with the alcohol issue. We were supporting clubs in adopting policies themselves and encouraging them to do so. We then actually put it into the rules in terms of juvenile activities. It should have been a rule anyway, but there is now zero sponsorship of juvenile teams, gear, equipment or competitions by alcohol companies permitted. Once we work with our members in order to let them know why we are working towards a goal, we will see general understanding and support for it and will reach a tipping point naturally at which the clubs themselves take ownership of it.</p>
