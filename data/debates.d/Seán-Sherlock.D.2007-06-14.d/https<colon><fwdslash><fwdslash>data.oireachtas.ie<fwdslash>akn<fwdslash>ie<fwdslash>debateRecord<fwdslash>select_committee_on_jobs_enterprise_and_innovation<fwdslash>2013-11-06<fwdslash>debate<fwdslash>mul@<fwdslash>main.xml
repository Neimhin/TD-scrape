          <p eId="para_9">This meeting has been convened to resume our consideration of Committee Stage of the Companies Bill 2012. I welcome Deputy Sean Sherlock, Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and all his officials. Before we resume our consideration of the Bill, the Minister of State wishes to respond to a number of points raised during the proceedings yesterday.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2013-11-06T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_10">I thank the Vice Chairman and committee members for allowing us to flag amendments which will be dealt with on Report Stage. As requested by members, my officials have brought copies of the ODCE's guide to directors' duties and powers. This document is available free of charge in both hard copy and on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, website. As I mentioned yesterday, the officials from my Department will arrange another briefing session for committee members prior to Report Stage to ensure that members are fully briefed on these proposed amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> In this context, I wish to remind members about the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, which will be progressing through the Houses in the coming weeks. This Bill will contain provisions that are considered to be too urgent to wait for the completion of the "Big Bill". This Bill amends the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in relation to the jurisdiction of the courts in examinerships. It provides that companies that are deemed to be small companies by virtue of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 may make their application to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court. It also contains provisions concerning the making of annual returns for subsidiary undertakings. It facilitates the reporting of offences under the companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and his or her officers. It authorises IAASA to collect a levy or levies from statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public interest entities. Finally the Bill makes provision for the Minister to provide regulations in relation to third country auditors and audit entities, who carry out audits of the annual or group accounts of a company falling within certain EU regulations. As the "small" Bill has not yet been enacted, it is not possible to give a more precise detail of its final version, although obviously the members of the committee will contribute to it when it comes before them in the next few weeks. As the goal of the Companies Bill 2012 is to consolidate all existing law, it is intended that the "small" Bill will be subsumed into it, ideally by way of Report Stage amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I would also like to note that I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and also to ensure that the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is applied consistently throughout the Bill.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_24">(b) is in force immediately before the commencement of this section,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_25">shall continue to have effect but with the modification that it shall operate to exempt the company from the use of the words “designated activity company” or “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” as part of its name and the publishing of its name.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_26">(10) Subsections (4) to (7) of the original section 24 shall continue in force in relation to the foregoing licence as if that section 24 had never been repealed, except that references in those subsections to the Minister, wherever occurring, shall be read as references to the Registrar.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_27">(11) An exemption that immediately before the repeal of the Act of 2001 operated, by virtue of the substituted section 24, in favour of a private company limited by shares (being a company that has re-registered as a DAC pursuant to <i>Chapter 6 </i>of <i>Part 2</i>) shall continue to have effect but—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_28">(a) with the modification that it shall operate to exempt the company from the use of the words “designated activity company” or “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” as part of its name and the publishing of its name; and</p>

          <p eId="para_34">The purpose of the section is to accommodate companies which have, on or after 1 March 2002, availed of the exemption from the requirement to include "limited" or "teoranta" in their name. As matters stand, under the Bill all companies which have, on or after March 2002, availed of the exemption, pursuant to section 24(1) of the Companies Act 1963 as substituted by section 88 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, from including "limited" in the name will have to reapply to the Companies Registration Office to obtain an exemption from including "DAC", designated activity company, in their name. This amendment is necessary as it will reduce the burden on such companies and they will not be required to claim the exemption a second time, a procedure which would result in filing fees and administrative overheads. The administrative burden to the Companies Registration Office will also be reduced as it will not have to reprocess these filings a second time.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Closer inspection of the Bill has revealed this section to be unnecessary.

Thus, when this Bill becomes law, pending the introduction of any regulations by the Minister pursuant to section 1085, regulations under section 239 of the 1990 Act will remain in force.

          <p eId="para_232">Most companies are established to manufacture or supply goods and services, operate in a legitimate way and the way they are regulated needs to be revised and changed from time to time, which is what the Bill is about. However, there are entities that cleverly masquerade as authentic companies with a facade of ordinariness about them but there is a great deal of public knowledge that they are involved in various nefarious schemes. Does the State need additional powers or does the State feel that is a matter for the Garda? Does a section in the Bill deal with this? I missed some of yesterday's meeting and the committee may have dealt with this evil in commercial life. Is there a recognition of it? Is it quantified? Are sufficient measures and instruments in place? Some of this activity damages and undermines legitimate business activity and adds to unemployment in legitimate trading areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">There are review clauses inherent in the legislation so that the company law review group can be involved. It is a statutory body and has a mandate to monitor, review and advise the Minister about existing company law and to make recommendations about its implementation and the introduction of new legislation. I do not think that necessarily answers the Deputy's question, but aside from the criminal activities, there are specific ways of punishing dishonest or irresponsible directors of insolvent companies and of protecting the public from further wrongdoing by such persons, namely by restricting or disqualifying directors. There are specific and robust proposals in regard to criminal sanctions, the jurisdiction of the courts, the role and responsibilities of the directors or persons involved in a company. Some of this is updating pre-existing law and consolidating it. I do not know if that answers Deputy Conaghan's query.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I move amendment No. 146:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_324">In page 938, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_325"><b>“1233. </b>(1) An unlimited company shall disclose by the filing of a notification with the Companies Registration Office a list of all members which are limited companies, and their respective number of allocated shares.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_326">(2) <i>Subsection (1) </i>shall apply to all body corporate members, wheresoever registered.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_327">(3) A transfer of shares to a new body corporate member which is a limited liability company shall not take effect until the notification referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>has been filed with the Companies Registration Office.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_328">(4) Failure to file the notification referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>may result, on application to the Court by any interested party, to the imposition of limited liability status on the unlimited company in question.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I am sorry I delayed proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Most people assume that when dealing with an unlimited company there is no upper limit on the personal liability of the shareholders for the company's debts if the company was to become insolvent. Approximately 4,000 or 2.3% of current Irish companies are unlimited and, as a result, they escape the stricter filing and disclose requirements that private limited companies are under. The filing and disclosure requirements allow a creditor to apprise himself of a company's solvency before trading with it. However, many large corporate sources are using unlimited liability companies but seeking to limit liability by ensuring that some or all of the shareholders of the unlimited company are themselves limited liability entities.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">It is always open to the courts to look through the corporate charter of unlimited companies and see for themselves unlimited company members - in other words, to lift the corporate veil - but this can only be done with the expense of an application to the courts. However, as the High Court recently remarked in the Goode Concrete <i>v</i>. CRH case, this approach is not possible when a limited company is an offshore company.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> This amendment requires all private unlimited companies to notify the Companies Registration Office, CRO, of any shareholder company that might limit its liability. In this way, a creditor may check the CRO records of an unlimited company at the outset of contractual negotiations and be aware of a fact that although a company may be registered as unlimited, the company's liability may be limited. The failure of an unlimited company to notify the CRO of any limited liability shareholder could result in the imposition of limited liability status on the companies immediately, as the courts see fit, within the limits of reasonableness and proportionality.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware of this, but at least four of the major construction companies that left in the region of €1 billion in debts behind were unlimited. People trading with them would not have been privy to their position because of their unlimited nature, and many companies are not quite as unlimited as they seem because of the loophole I have outlined. It would be a good idea for the Minister of State to take this on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">Under section 216(9)(<i>c</i>), every company is obliged to allow any person to inspect its members' register on the payment of a fee, which must be €10 or less. Section 216(12)(<i>c</i>) obliges companies to send a copy of their members' registers to any person who requests it, again for a fee of €10 or less. This register contains the names and addresses of members and the number of shares held by each member. This also applies to unlimited companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> As there is currently no requirement to report this information to the Companies Registration Office, it would be costly to set up a register both for the Companies Registration Office and for the affected companies. The ongoing cost to the CRO and affected companies of making and processing thousands of notifications would also be significant. The costs involved in delays to transfer of ownership of shares would be unacceptably high and could interfere with constitutional rights to private property. The information is already publicly available on request and the cost of creating and maintaining such a public register would be considerable, so I am not in favour of this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">The Minister of State has indicated that all this information is freely available to the public, but I know some people who would beg to differ, as they were on the receiving end. They got some very big surprises when trouble came around. Perhaps there are ways of accessing the information and these people were not <i>au fait</i> with those processes. The Minister of State has stated that this would be expensive, but just about everything is expensive today. In the interests of greater transparency, it would be a good idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I support Deputy Wallace, as there is no doubt that large companies have the resources and capacity to hide much information, no matter how much is made available. The Deputy has cited cases in the construction sphere and I am not sure about the cost argument, given the capacity for electronic filing of information. Do we have figures on the actual cost or burden of work? There is a difficulty as large corporate entities have the capacity to hide information, no matter what is contained in this Bill. In fairness to the transparency aspect, this amendment seems to be practical.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">Perhaps the Minister could reconsider the amendment on Report Stage to see if it could be tweaked in order to make it much more practical and less expensive. Even currently there is a major company going through the liquidation process and there will be a knock-on effect. People might not know the full financial position of companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">There is no problem returning to this on Report Stage for further deliberations, but we must acknowledge that unlimited companies function within the Irish infrastructure, serving many legitimate business purposes. They are a feature of company law across the European Union. Issues have been raised with regard to transparency, and perhaps we can provide more clarity in that respect for the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Just as guaranteed and public limited companies are important for certain kinds of business, unlimited companies also serve an important purpose. I am not suggesting that anybody is necessarily seeking to remove them, but to do so would be a disproportionate act which could affect Ireland's competitive advantage. I do not know if it is possible to quantify the burden of cost but we can try to do some work on it between now and the next Stage of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">Nobody is saying there should not be unlimited companies. There is a choice, which is fine. We are talking about unlimited companies that are not really unlimited but have the protection of limited companies. There is a cloak, and nobody knows where the company is in a financial sense. These companies may not be unlimited as they engage limited shareholdings offshore. They become limited companies, enjoying the best of both worlds.</p>

It could be a more suitable way of addressing that issue. That is a potential resource for the committee. The matter could be addressed on Report Stage in order to provide greater clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> The primary aim of this Bill is the consolidation of existing law and the provision of a user-friendly framework for businesses operating in Ireland. We must take into account the fundamental principle of the Bill. The issue that has been raised by a number of members could be addressed again on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">Before we put down the gavel I want to be certain we have the ability to table amendments on Report Stage around the term "accountant". The Minister will lead us but I want to be certain there will be no procedural issue. We flagged it yesterday and I want to flag it again. We need further consultation with the Minister on this and my party will bring forward amendments on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">I want to be clear on the issues raised by individual members so there is no ambiguity about dealing with the questions that arose between yesterday and today on specific matters. I acknowledge the forbearance of the committee about the introduction of new amendments on Report Stage and thank them for that. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is scheduled to meet a group from the committee next week on the issue of the accountancy matter. I acknowledge the collegiality of the committee regarding the speed with which we have moved through this Stage of the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I thank the Minister, Deputy Sherlock and his officials, Elaine, Tara and Philip, for attending and all our colleagues for their co-operation in the consideration of this Bill. Their business-like approach has been a very effective way to deal with the Bill. I appreciate everybody's efforts in doing that. I acknowledge the significant contribution of advance briefings provided by the Department officials. It meant much to the members that many issues were addressed at an early stage so we could tease them out. It resulted in the efficient passing of the Bill through Committee Stage. It was a common-sense approach and is great to have it finished today as opposed to over the next couple of weeks. I am very conscious that further briefings will be held before Report Stage and I thank the Department for that. They are very important to facilitate members who are trying to do their work properly. The briefings are key to that. Members get answers to all their questions. I thank the team here at the top table. Much effort went into organising this over the last couple of months.</p>
