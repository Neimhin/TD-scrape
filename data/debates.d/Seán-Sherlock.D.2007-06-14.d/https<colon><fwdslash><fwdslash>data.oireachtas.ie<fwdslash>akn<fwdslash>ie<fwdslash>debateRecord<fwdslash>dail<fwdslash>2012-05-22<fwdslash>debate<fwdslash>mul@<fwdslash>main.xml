            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">I anticipate there will be political representation at Ireland's Euro 2012 group stage matches, all of which take place in Poland.  As regards Ukraine, the European Union had made its concerns known to the authorities there about politically motivated trials and the conditions of detention of Ms. Tymoshenko.  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, has called on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure her right to appropriate medical assistance.  I fully support that call.  I discussed Ukraine with my EU Foreign Minister colleagues in Brussels on 14 May and we agreed that further progress on the EU's association agreement with Ukraine would require a number of positive steps on the resolution of the issue of politically motivated trials, including Ms. Tymoshenko's detention, and the free and fair conduct of the parliamentary elections due to take place in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">On the issue of attending matches in Ukraine, there is no common EU position.  A number of political figures have made it known that they do not intend to visit Ukraine while Ms. Tymoshenko is imprisoned or will not attend matches in Ukraine during the championships.  An alternative view has been expressed that a sports boycott would not be an effective tool of persuasion or could send an unintended signal to the wider Ukrainian public.  Individual member states will need to assess this question for themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">For my own part, I have no official travel plans that would entail attendance at a match in Ukraine during the championships.  However, I cannot at this time rule out a visit to Ukraine at some point this year, including in my separate capacity as chairman-in-office of the OSCE as this is a forum in which Ukraine plays an important role and it will assume the chairmanship-in-office next year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
            <p eId="para_5">We hope the dilemma the Tánaiste faces is whether to go to Kiev.  We all hope there will be an Irish match in that location.  We also appreciate the general public desire to see a separation of politics and sport.  It is not a great idea for politics to intrude onto the field of sport.  Notwithstanding that, the circumstances surrounding the case of Julia Tymoshenko, which have been highlighted internationally, are so fundamentally wrong and concerning that one must ask what is the plight of the ordinary citizens who fall foul of the justice system in the country, if a state can treat a former Prime Minister in this way, where she is held in a hospital ward with guards in the ward and television cameras monitoring her constantly.  We hope Ireland will be playing in Kiev.  If that situation arises, can the Tánaiste give us an understanding of his position and whether he will have discussions with our honorary consul and our diplomatic representatives in order to give them guidance on their position?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_6">The detention and trial of Ms Tymoshenko has given rise to considerable concern about the conditions of her detention.  She was sentenced on 11 October 2011 to seven years in prison and was the subject of a three-year ban on holding high public office.  She was also subject to an order to repay €130 million to the state-owned gas company, having been convicted of exceeding her authority as Prime Minister when concluding a gas deal with Russia in 2009.  I do not have any plans to travel to the Ukraine to attend any of the football games.  We are making arrangements for consular services to be provided because we expect there will be a significant number of Irish fans travelling to the Ukraine if we qualify from the first round.  We are making arrangements to have consular services there to support and to be of assistance to the fans.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">We must discuss with the Ukraine issues of a bilateral nature and issues in the context of the chairmanship of the OSCE.  At some stage this year it is possible that I may travel to Ukraine to conduct business.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
            <p eId="para_8">In the event of the Tánaiste travelling in the course of 2012, does he anticipate seeking an opportunity to visit the prisoner to see for himself the circumstances in which she exists?  Will the Tánaiste instruct our consular or diplomatic representatives to meet the former president and discuss her plight?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_9">There has already been an international visit to Ms Tymoshenko and we have relayed the deep concerns of the Irish Government in Kiev and in Dublin.  We will continue to do that.  The issue of concern with regard to the Ukraine at the EU Foreign Affairs Council was not solely Ms Tymoshenko but also the conduct of the elections to be held in October and this must be taken into account.</p>

[25422/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_6" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_12">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 101 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">Ireland and its EU partners have on many occasions expressed firm support for a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians and the wider Arab world, on the basis of the two-state solution.  Although the talks process is at present stalled, we continue to do what we can to encourage the parties to engage and to work towards that end.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">There is increasing concern in the EU, which I have highlighted, that the relentless progress of Israeli policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is undermining the possibility of constructing a viable Palestinian state.  These policies pose a threat to the prospect of a negotiated political settlement and run directly counter to the two-state solution which has been the central objective of the EU for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">At the urging of Ireland and other member states, the Foreign Affairs Council last Monday focused its discussion not on the overall peace process but on these specific viability issues, notably issues around Israeli settlement expansion and the pressure on Palestinians in East Jerusalem and area C, which is that part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the West Bank still fully under Israeli military control and occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The Council conclusions adopted last week send out a strong and united EU message on these critical and urgent issues.  Ireland was heavily involved in the preparation of these important conclusions and fully supports them.  The EU has set out in some detail the issues which threaten a two-state solution, the EU's position in respect of these issues and the remedial action it wishes to see, primarily, of course, from Israel.  I very much welcome and support these strong Council conclusions, which restate and in many respects advance EU positions on these key points.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">I suggested at the Council that in view of the urgency of these issues on the ground, Ministers should look at them again in the autumn to see if the situation had improved or was continuing to worsen.  I suggested that if matters continued to worsen and our existing actions had not improved them, we would clearly need to consider stronger actions.  The exclusion from the EU of settlement products and of individual settlers engaged in violence, should, in that case, be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">I have previously stated that Ireland would support a ban on settlement products.  We do not support bans or boycotts on Israel, and this is not in question, but the products of illegal settlements constitute a separate and specific matter.  However, this is in the future and the Council as a whole will need to decide on any actions.  I would emphasise that with sustained work and the co-operation of partners, we have achieved a strong set of EU conclusions which all 27 member states have supported and which now places High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and the EU in a stronger position to argue for the continuing viability of the two-state solution, both within the framework of the international quartet and more generally throughout the region.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>

This is my second opportunity to congratulate the Tánaiste and it is very important that our State continues to seek for justice and peace between the Palestinian people and the Israeli people but in the interim to defend the rights of the Palestinian people who are being so grievously offended in the West Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I refer to the reports on area C which currently has a population of 150,000 Palestinians and 300,000 of a growing Jewish population.  The Oslo Accord was to have resolved this question but it is clear there is now a focused ongoing initiative by the Israeli Government to continue to build in that area.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for welcoming the statement from the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  This strong and significant statement addresses the conditions on the ground.  We all want to see meaningful talks resuming between Israel and Palestine, with a view to putting in place the two-state solution.  It is not realistic to have that, however, in circumstances where settlement activity is taking place.  As President Abbas said, one cannot talk about a state for Palestine if one continues to build on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">I saw the reality for myself when I visited area C when I was in the region in January.  In effect, as these settlements continue, they are making it physically impossible for a two-state solution to materialise.  We are seeing a settlement right around the eastern part of Jerusalem, which in many ways is sealing off the Palestinian population within Jerusalem.  In addition, we are seeing settlement activity whose effect, if it continues, will be to cut in half the northern part of the West Bank from the southern part, thus making things very difficult on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">The statement by the EU Foreign Affairs Council has nailed that matter by clearly identifying it.  That is why, at the Council meeting, I argued that we need to return to this topic in the autumn to see what has happened in the meantime and then examine what further steps may be appropriate.</p>

I commend the Tánaiste and his EU counterparts on the mid-May communiqué, as well as for highlighting the issue of goods emanating from the settlements.  Talking to Israeli representatives in this country, one gets the sense of a willingness to negotiate and move forward.  What one sees happening on the ground, however, is very much at variance with what we hear.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">I am struck by the Tánaiste's unique position as chair of the OSCE.  He recently convened a conference on Ireland's role in conflict resolution, which is a point I have been repeatedly highlighting.  Notwithstanding the merits of EU involvement and being conscious of the efforts of Mr. Tony Blair in this particular region, does the Tánaiste see any opportunity for Ireland to play a role, given our unique history?  Some 30 years ago our problems seemed to be as intractable as the Middle East appears today.  For example, could the Tánaiste see us taking some unilateral action?  Can he envisage a situation in which he might dispatch a troika from Ireland, perhaps comprising Mr. David Trimble, Mr. Martin McGuinness and Mr. Bertie Ahern, who have practical, hands-on experience of conflict resolution?  Could the Tánaiste see a situation like that being initiated?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">We have invested a lot of effort in getting an agreed EU position and statement.  That was not easy.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, there have been differing views within the EU and the Foreign Affairs Council concerning the Middle East peace process.  It was a significant step forward to arrive at a conclusion last Monday upon which all 27 EU foreign Ministers were able to agree.  I would like to see that momentum being maintained and therefore we need to continue to have a united EU position on where we are moving things.  There are a number of matters we have to advance, the first of which is maintaining the pressure for talks to be resumed.  The Quartet statement, which was issued in September 2011, sets out the framework for that.  The timetable is being missed but, nevertheless, the framework is there for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">Second, we must be clear about what is happening on the ground and make a clear statement about it.  That was the thrust of the recent statement.

However, there has to be a willingness both on the part of the Israeli side and the Palestinian side to engage in meaningful discussions.  While I was in the region in January I met with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.  I strongly advocated that there needs to be an engagement and that this issue ultimately has to be settled by negotiation but I understand President Abbas's position is undermined by settlement activity taking place.  To be fair, the position of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israel Government is also compromised by any terrorist activity that takes place which threatens the security of the people of Israel.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">The issue of prisons within Northern Ireland is a devolved matter related to the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Prison Service.   Arising from the Hillsborough Agreement of February 2010, Dame Ann Owers and the prison review team undertook a review of the prison system.  In October 2011 their report made 40 recommendations on prison reform in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, has underlined his commitment to full implementation of the recommendations and has described the prison reform process as "unstoppable".  I had an opportunity to discuss the reform process with him at our most recent meeting on 20 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">Implementation of the Owers report remains the most effective way to ensure that prison conditions in Northern Ireland meet the required standard.  The Government will continue to raise concerns regarding the circumstances of conditions of detention of Irish citizens as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Concerns have been raised about the circumstances of this prisoner's detention, both in this House and directly with me by human rights organisations.  The prisoner's defence team maintain that as she was granted a royal prerogative of mercy, the terms of the licence do not apply.  I discussed this issue with Secretary of State Paterson on 27 April.  I have been advised that the parole commissioners considered the terms of the royal prerogative of mercy after receiving submissions on behalf of the prisoner and the Secretary of State and had ruled that "the life sentences were not in fact remitted by the royal prerogative of mercy" and that the prisoner "remains subject to the life licence".  I understand that the case is currently under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Concerns surrounding the prisoner's health led to the prisoner being moved to the medical wing of Hydebank Prison where I have been informed that medical and prison administration staff are making every effort to make the prisoner comfortable.  I have been advised that a medical expert has requested an assessment visit and I have asked to be informed on the outcome of that visit.  In the meantime my officials are in regular contact with the authorities in Northern Ireland, human rights NGOs and others close to this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">The Tánaiste's answer might have been acceptable except for the fact that these issues have been ongoing for some time.  They have been kicked to touch or from one person to another for far too long.  In the meantime, the human rights issues have worsened, with solitary confinement, the denial of medical treatment, inadequate medical treatment and regular full body searches although scanners are supposed to be used.  Elected representatives, human rights organisations and the Pat Finucane Centre have not received responses to their inquiries from the authorities in the North.  Human rights regulations are being disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">In January in response to a question I asked, the Minister for Justice and Equality stated the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade had been involved in negotiations the previous summer.  This has been going on for almost a year and in the meantime the conditions for some of the prisoners have deteriorated.  What other action can be taken?  Action is required instead of phrases such as "we will continue to monitor it" and "we are in close consultation" before one of the prisoners dies.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">As I stated, responsibility for prisons in Northern Ireland has been devolved to the Department of Justice under the remit of the Minister, Mr. Ford, MLA.  Among the issues which arise is reform of the prison service in Northern Ireland.  The Minister categorically stated to us he is implementing the recommendation of the Owers report and the process is unstoppable.  We have raised the issues of human rights and the conditions of the prisoners in Maghaberry Prison, in particular the prisoner moved to Highbank Prison, with the Minister and the Secretary of State, Mr Paterson, MP.  I have asked departmental officials to monitor the situation very closely and keep in touch with the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice there and we will continue to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">The denial of medical treatment and the way in which medication has been withheld from one of the male prisoners are very serious issues.  I am also aware of issues regarding the health of Marian Price.  When is a royal prerogative not a royal prerogative?  Is it when it suits the authorities in the North and in England?  Mr. Owen Paterson, MP, has not been elected by anyone in the North and is not accountable to the electorate in the North, but he seems to be able to disregard human rights legislation and legal issues.  We speak about human rights at meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and we take up the cases of prisoners in Bahrain, Iran and China.  Yet, this is happening up the road and is an urgent matter because one of the prisoners will die.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">Responsibility for prisons has been devolved to the Northern Ireland Administration under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  With regard to the royal prerogative, three sentences were handed down to Marian Price; she was sentenced to two life sentences and one sentence of 20 years.  My information is that the royal prerogative applied to the 20 year sentence and the life sentences were covered by a life licence which may be withdrawn, which is what happened in this case.  I share the Deputy's immediate concern about Ms Price's medical condition and health and about the conditions under which she and other prisoners are detained.  I wish to make clear we have raised these issues with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Secretary of State and we will continue to do so at political and official level.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I congratulate the newly appointed members of the French Government, including the new French Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, on taking up their new appointments.  Throughout the presidential election campaign and since, President Hollande has made clear his intention to seek to complement the stability treaty with a growth-oriented approach.  The comments by Mr. Moscovici are entirely consistent with that approach, which the Government has welcomed.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">The European Council will meet tomorrow to consider how to advance the growth and jobs agenda, and it will return to the matter again in its meeting next month.  These are important meetings and we will engage actively in the discussions.  There is now an understanding at European level that we need to continue with the reforms necessary to place our economies on a sustainable path, but that this needs to be balanced with policies to generate growth and to create jobs.  This will require progress on a number of important fronts.  We need to continue to press ahead with implementation of existing commitments, especially regarding the Single Market.  President Van Rompuy has argued for rapid progress in a number of areas, on which I fully support him.  President Barroso has also signalled that the Commission is working on identifying further areas that have the capacity to provide the greatest and most immediate boost to growth and will come forward with a targeted set of measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">We also need to continue with reforms at national level as part of the Europe 2020 process aimed at future-proofing our economies.  The Commission will make its specific recommendations for each member state on 30 May and these must be advanced as a priority.  Ireland's EU-IMF programme is at the heart of Ireland's efforts in this process.  However, it is clear that steps are also necessary to improve prospects for growth in the short term.  In this regard, a number of important and interesting proposals have been brought to the table, including those made by President Hollande.  These include the possibility of increasing the capital available to the European Investment Bank as a means of improving its capacity for onward lending; considering whether there are ways in which unspent structural funds can be mobilised in support of our growth agenda; and advancing the Commission's project bonds initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">It is important that these measures are all seen in the round.  As I have said before, efforts to ensure stability, such as the new treaty, and efforts to drive growth are two sides of the one coin.  There will be no growth without stability and no stability without growth.  The Government is very strongly of the view that the best way for Ireland to secure its recovery and its future is to endorse the treaty; to put ourselves in a position where we have a credible and secure line of future funding, should it be needed; and to work closely and urgently with like-minded partners at European level to drive forward the jobs and growth agenda.</p>

On several occasions when those of us on the "No" side, including Sinn Féin, made this point clear, the Government challenged us.  The French Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, has now repeated that assertion that France will not ratify as is, but will negotiate to seek significant changes on growth and jobs.  That has now clearly led to that perspective being raised at the G8 gathering that took place in the past week.  What I want to say is-----</p>

It did not call for changes to the text regarding growth.  It has done nothing compared with what the French President and his Finance Minister are now stating.  All the parties of the left - the social democratic parties - and even the European Trade Union Confederation have spoken out against the treaty.  When will the Tánaiste change tack?  Why is his party alone on the left and in the social democratic movement in Europe so enthusiastically selling this treaty as it is?</p>

            <p eId="para_53">I am not alone.  All the parties, to which the Deputy refers, support the budgetary discipline measures that are contained in the treaty.  President Hollande and the French Government are seeking what the Government here has been discussing since last year.  The Government was among the first to argue that we needed growth and jobs measures in order to complement the stability treaty.  In addition it was agreed that there would be such an agenda.  First, it is contained in the text of the treaty which states clearly that its purpose is to promote growth, competitiveness, employment and social cohesion in Europe.  Second, it was expressed clearly in the conclusions of the January summit where the treaty was finally agreed, that there would be a growth agenda and a number of specific measures were set out at that meeting, including measures to tackle youth unemployment, measures to provide for lending to small and medium-sized businesses and regarding completion of the Single Market.  President Hollande is talking about precisely the same thing and we welcome it.  I expect that tomorrow's European Council meeting will discuss how that growth agenda can be advanced.  Those may relate to the European Investment Bank, Structural Funds and project funds.  Arising from that, I hope it will be possible to return to the June summit meeting, because tomorrow's meeting is an informal one, with a concrete programme of growth measures to complement the stability treaty, the provisions of which are supported by President Hollande and other social democratic parties in Europe.</p>

Is the Minister or the Government actively renegotiating the treaty?  Is the Government seeking eurobonds, the deployment of the European Investment Bank or a write down of banking debt in Ireland, which means we cannot meet the targets in real terms?  Can the Minister give us some specific details about what the Government is seeking to achieve in this renegotiation?</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I wish to be clear about this, because Sinn Féin has a habit of constantly misquoting, selectively quoting and twisting words and terms.  The treaty on which we will vote on 31 May is not being renegotiated.  The text of that treaty is clear and it will not change.  What we are doing, and what we have been doing since last year, is pursuing a growth agenda.  We have always said that the stability treaty alone was not the sole means of getting the European economy to recover and grow, and that there must also be growth and jobs.  We have put forward a number of suggestions, some of which were taken up in January.  We have supported and advocated a widening of the role of the European Investment Bank.  Building on the decision made in January, which addressed how unused Structural Funds might be used to address issues such as youth unemployment, we are looking at ways that might become a reality.  We would support the concept of project funds and eurobonds.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">Bank debt is a separate issue.  We have been pursuing a separate track of negotiation relating to bank debt and we have already made progress on that.  We secured a reduction in the interest rate and agreement on the exchange of the promissory note for a longer term bond.  We continue to negotiate with the ECB on ways of re-engineering the bank debt to the best advantage of the Irish taxpayer.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)  (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_70">I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 117, 127, 134, 158, 160, 164 to 167, inclusive, 181, 185 and 201 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">The Government continues to monitor and respond to the humanitarian needs generated by a number of conflicts and protracted crises in Africa, notably those in Sudan, South Sudan, the Horn of Africa, Somalia and the Sahel.  Almost one year on from the peak of the Horn of Africa crisis, the overall humanitarian situation across much of this region has now improved thanks in large part to the massive aid operation which donors such as Ireland helped to support.  However, the situation remains critical for many millions of people, especially in Somalia, where access for aid agencies remains highly restricted in many areas.  Emergency funding allocated by Irish Aid towards the overall relief effort in the Horn of Africa currently stands at almost €17 million, making Ireland, in <i>per capita</i> terms, one of the most significant humanitarian donors to the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">We are, however, particularly concerned about the increasingly difficult humanitarian situation in Sudan, notably in the border states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where 350,000 civilians have been severely affected by the fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-North.  In addition to those affected within these two states, some 140,000 refugees have already fled to Ethiopia and South Sudan, while 100,000 more have been displaced as a result of fighting around the disputed border area of Abyei.  One of the key issues of concern relates to access for aid agencies to the areas affected by the conflict.  Ireland, together with its EU partners, is actively supporting efforts to ensure that both Sudan and South Sudan comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian agencies gain full access to those in need.  The Government has raised the issue of access at EU level and in other international fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">In January last, and with Ireland's encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance.  The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to moving forward with the full range of support it would like to provide to Sudan.  Last month, the European Union called on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, SPLM-North, to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government already has allocated €2 million this year for the UN-managed common humanitarian funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan and is currently considering a further additional contribution.  These funds are being used to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas beset by conflict and affected by displacement from Blue Nile and South Kordofan.  A further €1.22 million has been made available to Irish NGOs, namely, Trócaire, GOAL and World Vision, for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual humanitarian programme planning funding scheme.  Our assistance is saving lives daily.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">I assure the many Members who have taken an interest in this matter that the Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan, the Blue Nile and other areas facing critical need across the Horn of Africa and Sahel regions.  In conjunction with its EU partners, the Government will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
            <p eId="para_76">I thank the Minister of State for his response and for what his Department is doing and urge the Government to continue to support these regions.  Last November, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I had the privilege of visiting Ethiopia and its western borders to meet the refugees who then were pouring across the border from Sudan and South Sudan and we saw how intractable are the problems in that region.  I commend the Department on its activities.  Members also should commend the Ethiopian Government, which shows extraordinary generosity in taking in massive influxes of people from all its borders despite its own difficult financial position.  I also commend the NGOs and note that only last week, Oxfam returned from a visit to Burkina Faso and Niger during which it was highlighting the crises there.  Similarly, Trócaire plans to undertake a fact-finding or rather, a highlighting mission in August to some of these countries.  The Department is doing good work and I urge it to keep it up.  Moreover, the Government should challenge our European partners and those much wealthier states, which have much more to give but are reluctant to so do, to play their role as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_77">I thank the Deputy for the compliments in respect of the activities in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is engaged.  Certainly, the entire Horn of Africa and Sahel region is difficult.  Moreover, it is bedevilled by conflicts in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan and by the number of displaced people, the dangers of famine and the disruption that is taking place.  Furthermore, it is affecting the neighbouring countries and the Deputy mentioned Ethiopia, which has been consistent in minding its borders carefully in this regard.  The Department is working closely with the United Nations and the European Union on these matters.  Ireland undoubtedly has played a quite significant role in this respect.  Since 2008, Ireland has given €28 million to the Horn of Africa-Sahel region, including the area encompassing South Sudan and Sudan.  In addition, Ireland has funded its NGOs, which have limited access to the area but which are working in extremely difficult circumstances.  I certainly compliment them on the work they are doing.  The European Union called last month on the warring partners, the Liberation Army in South Sudan and the Sudanese forces, to come to the table and use the comprehensive peace process of 2005 to resolve their difficulties.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_29">
            <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
            <p eId="para_78">Like Deputy Ó Feargháil, I too had the opportunity as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to visit Ethiopia and to see at first hand the first flood of refugees to the United Nations established Tongo refugee camp and the generosity of the Ethiopian state to the Somalians who are in great devastation.  Drought has become famine because of political instability in Sudan and Somalia.  It is interesting to note that Ethiopia would also be enduring drought conditions but for the assistance of Irish and international NGOs and donor states, which illustrates the impact of proper political management.  There should be no famine in the year 2012.  There can be no excuse for famine in the world in which we live today.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">I again commend the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid on the work they do in this area.  It is clear the reputation of Ireland, a small state of 4.5 million people, is immense in those areas.  The duration of our reception by the Ethiopian Prime Minister is a reflection of their respect for us.  We need to use that reputation in our continued efforts to influence more powerful states to play a similar role.  I commend the Government, the Department and Irish Aid on the work they are doing and encourage them to keep it going.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_80">The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, said that the Government is monitoring human rights abuses in Africa.  Perhaps he will comment on the UN human rights group report on Libya which refers to 8,000 prisoners being held without trial, deaths in detention, ethnic cleansing in Tawergha - a town of 30,000 mainly black Libyans - violent persecution of sub-Saharan Africans and Libya being in the grip of lawless warlords and armed conflict between militia.  When the intervention commenced, 2,000 civilians had been killed.  The current figure in this regard is estimated to be 30,000.  NATO moved in and Sarkozy was driving the agenda so as to re-establish his position for re-election.  NATO has since pulled out, resulting in Libya becoming a disaster zone.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_82">I thank Members for their questions.  There is no doubt but that the Ethiopian model can be used by neighbouring states.  Members will recall that during the time of "Live Aid" millions of people in Ethiopia were dying.  Now, because of work done by NGOs, in particular the active role played by Irish Aid, Irish NGOs and funding provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a safety net programme has been put in place, which is being replicated throughout Ethiopia and is helping to prevent recurring famine.  This is something we would like to see extended to other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">Somalia and Sudan, in particular south Sudan, are bedevilled by ongoing conflict, which makes it difficult for small NGOs to gain access and for the putting in place of any consistent programme that will deal with irrigation, food shortages and so on.  As stated by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, Ethiopia is to be complimented on the manner in which has dealt with its situation, in which Irish Aid has been very much involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">On Libya, which is a totally different issue, if Deputy Wallace wishes to table a parliamentary question on the matter, I would be delighted to answer it.  I will look closely at the issue of prisoners and prisoners rights and will come back to the Deputy on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">As chairman-in-office of the OSCE, I was delighted to host in Dublin recently a major conference which was entitled "Shared future: building and sustaining peace - the Northern Ireland case study".  My aim in hosting this conference was to support and encourage those engaged in efforts to resolve ongoing conflicts elsewhere in the OSCE region by sharing our own successful experience of conflict resolution and peace-building in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">I was pleased at the high level of participation and the deep engagement and interest in our peace process which was shown by those who attended.  I am particularly grateful to our moderator, Martti Ahtisaari, and to the distinguished speakers who accepted our invitation to speak at the conference.  Among many remarkable interventions in the course of the day, I would like to single out the contributions made by the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, MLA, the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA, and former US Senator, George Mitchell.  Our objective was to increase international awareness of what helped to achieve a comprehensive and lasting agreement on this island and, without seeking in any way to present our experience as a template, to draw attention to concepts and approaches which might conceivably have relevance elsewhere.  There was a high level of interest in this conference, both at home and abroad, and the feedback has been extremely positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">Over the past few years, successive Irish Governments have been actively sharing the experience and insights gained during our peace process with groups operating in conflict situations in many different parts of the world.  A small conflict resolution unit was created in my Department in 2007 to facilitate this work and to assist those striving for peaceful settlements elsewhere.  In this and other ways, Ireland is making a strong national contribution to conflict resolution and mediation efforts around the world.  In my concluding remarks at the recent conference, I indicated that we are willing to provide more detailed briefings on aspects of the Northern Ireland peace process, should this be helpful to those engaged in conflict resolution efforts in the OSCE area.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">At the end of this month we will host a seminar along these lines for Moldovan and Transdniestrian negotiators from the so-called 5+2 talks.  This seminar is being organised at the request of the two sides and the programme in Dublin will be followed by meetings in Belfast.  A formal round of talks in the 5+2 framework took place in Dublin in late February and there was a further round in Vienna last month.  Progress to date has been encouraging, and I hope the forthcoming seminar will build momentum for further progress in the talks when they resume in July.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">The Tánaiste is to be commended for holding this conference, which is an important initiative.  We have a lot to offer and can become much more proactive in the whole area of conflict resolution.  I see this very much in the context of developing Ireland's reputation abroad, boosting our opportunities for trade and augmenting our development aid budget.  As that last is constrained, we could find that, by virtue of a role in conflict resolution, we could achieve far more on behalf of beleaguered people in various parts of the developing world.  So much of what we see in terms of hunger and deprivation has its origins in conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">What the Tánaiste is doing is to be commended, therefore, but how ambitious is he to develop this initiative further?  Can we, via the OSCE and our membership of the European Union, garner greater resources to put into the conflict resolution unit that was established in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2007 and take on the myriad challenges in which we might assist?</p>

            <p eId="para_92">In this year, while we hold the chair-in-office of the OSCE, we have decided to concentrate on the three areas of conflict which are within the OSCE region, namely, the conflict in Moldova regarding the Transdniestrian region; the conflict in Georgia regarding the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which is the subject of the Minsk Process.  We are using the experiences in Northern Ireland to address these conflicts, not as a kind of template to settle other disputes because each dispute and conflict is different, but to provide encouragement to those who are engaged in the talks process to persist with it and use it as a way of guiding events forward.  In addition, I have appointed two special representatives, ambassadors Pádraig Murphy and Erwan Fouéré, to assist me in attempting to move forward talks processes in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">With regard to the Moldova-Transdniestrian conflict, we had the 5 + 2 discussions at Farmleigh in February, at which some progress was made, and there will be a seminar later this month on what can be learned from the Northern Ireland conflict.  Delegates will visit Belfast and the talks will resume formally in July.  I hope to be able to visit the southern Caucasus area with a view to looking at the situation in Georgia and at the Nagorno-Karabakh.dispute.  It is really about concentrating on these three protracted conflicts and using our year of chairmanship of the OSCE to make a positive contribution to try to get settlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">Ireland's national action plan in regard to UN Security Council Resolution 1325, on women, peace and security, was officially launched in November 2011.  The plan sets out how Ireland will promote and implement the objectives of UNSCR 1325 in its programme support activities, diplomatic advocacy and policy-making across the interrelated areas of peace, security and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">By adopting a national action plan, we have made a firm commitment to listen to the voices of women affected by conflict.  To this end, the plan aims to strengthen women's leadership and implement accountability mechanisms, to reinforce institutional capacities through comprehensive training of staff deployed overseas and to support programmes to promote women's participation in peacebuilding, post-conflict transition and related activities.  The plan also commits Ireland to use its involvement in global and regional fora to champion the implementation of UNSCR 1325.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">The plan contains a number of provisions for monitoring and evaluation.  These are important in ensuring that the national action plan is a living document which serves the goal of effective implementation of UNSCR 1325 and related UN obligations on women, peace and security.  The plan provides for the formation of a monitoring group to oversee progress on implementation.  This group will consist of representatives from all relevant Departments as well as members of civil society and the academic community with expertise in the field.  It will meet every six months under an independent chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">Officials from my Department will meet with key representatives from civil society next week to discuss the formation of the monitoring group and the appointment of an independent chair.  I look forward to productive discussions in that format and to effective cooperation among all relevant stakeholders, both inside and outside government, in support of implementation of the national action plan.

It was to have been launched on International Women's Day in March last year but was delayed because of the general election and the coming in of the new Government.  There is great frustration in civil society that we do not have the implementation of a plan and I am sure the Tánaiste appreciates that.  This is a very serious commitment, involving a UN Security Council resolution on giving women their place in conflict resolution.  There is much we can look at both in terms of Ireland and our work overseas.  I urge the Tánaiste to ensure this is taken on board.  I welcome that he is meeting members of civil society next week but we really need to honour this commitment, particularly given that we hold the chair of the OSCE this year.</p>

In 2009, a total of €485,000 came from the Department's stability fund; in 2010 the figure was €412,500.

            <p eId="para_102">Preparations for Ireland's EU Presidency are under way in all Departments.  Significant progress has been made in setting Presidency priorities for the first six months of 2013.  The Presidency is an important opportunity for Ireland to rebuild its positive image as a credible, effective and trustworthy international player.  At a practical level, the Government has taken a number of decisions with a view to putting in place an efficient and cost-effective Presidency.  The need for financial discipline means that expenditure for the Irish Presidency will be tightly controlled.  As an important cost containment measure, the Government has decided that Dublin Castle and other State-owned properties in the Dublin area will be the default venues for all Presidency-related events in Ireland.  The Office of Public Works has been fully engaged with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach in identifying and pre-planning the facilities and requirements for events during the Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Work is proceeding on the expansion of facilities at the permanent representation in Brussels to accommodate the extra staff from all Departments that will be working there for the Presidency.  Work is also under way on a centralised procurement scheme for all goods and services that will be required for the running of the Presidency.  I expect that by taking a more collective approach, we will be able to maximise the potential economies of scale and reduce some of the administrative overheads incurred through individual tendering for similar goods and services.  A prior information notice for the possible procurement of a number of requirements for the EU Presidency was published by my Department on 9 March 2012 on the eTenders website.  The services and supplies included on the notice include accommodation; catering, hospitality and event management; chauffeur driving and bus transport services; interpretation and translation services; and an accreditation and badging service for delegates and media.  The publication of a prior information notice does not necessarily mean there is a commitment to procuring these items.  However, it underlines the transparent approach being taken to procurement, gives suppliers more time to prepare for possible tenders and will result in more cost-effective outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">In 2004, the current Tánaiste was critical of the expenditure that was incurred when many meetings were held across the country.  The Government of the time was trying to showcase the country to its best advantage.  There are suggestions that the number of ministerial meetings in this country will be reduced.  Is the Minister of State concerned that such a move would limit our opportunity to showcase the best of what Ireland has to offer at a time when that might be needed more than it was in the past?  I fully appreciate the need for strict control of budgets in this regard, as set out by the Minister of State.  I commend the Government in that respect.  Does the Minister of State have a ballpark figure for what the whole initiative will cost?  I have seen a figure of €60 million, excluding security.  Can she put a more precise figure on it at this stage?</p>

            <p eId="para_105">That is the ballpark figure.  The detail of that will be expanded on as we get closer to the Presidency and the procurement process is completed.  The ballpark figure is essentially the same as the cost of the Hungarian Presidency and the current Danish Presidency.  The Polish Presidency had a bigger budget that will not be available to us, quite frankly.  This is really about common sense.  We have to ensure we do not over-extend ourselves as we try to maximise the potential of the Presidency.  I am very excited about the Presidency because it will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase Ireland in Europe and Europe in Ireland, both of which are extremely important.  I do not agree that having high-level informal meetings in places like Ashford Castle and Dromoland Castle is the way to showcase Europe in Ireland.  There is very little benefit from holding such meetings in venues around the country.  Perhaps they allow particular Ministers to boast that they have brought ministerial meetings to their own constituencies.  The value of the contributions such meetings make to local economies is limited.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">The Deputies know as well as I do that when Ministers go to these events, they want to do their business and get out of there as quickly as they can.  Time is precious.  A total of 160 meetings will take place during the Irish Presidency.  Some of them will be held outside Dublin.  The vast majority of them, including all of the informal ministerial meetings, will take place in Dublin.  I remind the House that other events will take place.  I am chairing the interdepartmental committee that is working on the plans for the policy side of the programme.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, I am co-chairing a preparatory group that involves all the key stakeholders for the cultural programme for the Presidency.  Although it has a very limited budget, the cultural programme will be very exciting.  There will be opportunities for towns and villages around the country to be twinned with towns and villages in other countries.  The involvement of citizens at grassroots level is much more valuable than spending vast sums of money on bringing interpretation booths around the country to facilitate Ministers.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I would like to ask about the cost efficiency of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  Can the Minister of State guarantee that many of those who provide goods and services during the Presidency will be based in Ireland?  That would ensure the Presidency has an impact on the local economy.  The Minister of State mentioned a figure of €60 million.  There is potential for the catering and wholesale trades to benefit from the Presidency.  We need to support local and indigenous Irish businesses, particularly in the restaurant and hotel services industry, by generating business for them.  That would give them a leg up in the current economic crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">It goes without saying that we will use the Presidency to showcase Irish goods and services.  The Government intends to use the tendering process to ensure, as far as possible while complying with our legal obligations, that Irish companies are given every opportunity to showcase their goods and to benefit.  The Presidency will have enormous potential for the restaurant industry and the hospitality sector.  I mentioned some aspects of the cultural programme.  We are working closely with Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia.  I am chairing a group of semi-State companies that is examining opportunities and ways of leveraging potential for Ireland from the semi-State side.  Of course, the Presidency will tie in very well with all the events that will take place throughout 2013 as part of the Gathering.  We intend to exploit all of the limitless opportunities that will present themselves next year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_111">This is a legally difficult and complex issue.  The concerns referred to in this question have been raised with me by the Pat Finucane Centre and other human rights non-governmental organisations.  Following receipt of these concerns, I discussed the issue with the Secretary of State on 27 April last.  He told me that the process which led to the detention of the woman in question fully adhered to the law.  I was informed that advice was sought from an independent body to verify that the action was pursued in a correct manner.  The Northern Ireland Office has confirmed that a royal prerogative of mercy was given to Marian Price on 30 April 1980.  It has advised that this pardon was granted in respect of a sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to cause an explosion and not in respect of the sentence of two terms of life imprisonment related to the Old Bailey bombing.  On 22 February last, this contention was upheld by the Parole Commission, which ruled that the prisoner is subject to life licence in respect of the two life sentences.  Further legal avenues remain available to appeal this decision.  I believe the prisoner's legal representatives are exploring these options.  I am aware of concerns that have been raised regarding the health of the prisoner, both in terms of her initial incarceration in Maghaberry Prison and her subsequent transfer to the women's ward of Hydebank Wood Prison.  I have been informed that every effort is being made to make the prisoner comfortable.  I have been advised that a medical expert has requested an assessment visit.  I have asked to be informed of the outcome of that visit.  In the meantime, my officials are in regular contact with the authorities in Northern Ireland, human rights non-governmental organisations and others close to this case.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_47">
            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_112">This is a serious human rights issue.  I would like to echo some of the points that were made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan earlier.  The conditions of Marian Price's detention are cause for serious concern.  She is a woman in very poor health.  She was isolated for ten months in a men's prison and is now behind a wooden door again, isolated in an area of three cells, with no unsupervised access to fresh air and so on.  We need to do more.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">The nub of the issue lies with the pardon itself and the fact this pardon seemingly no longer exists.  I ask the Tánaiste what further action he can take in order to find it.  The reality is she was released under a pardon in 1980 yet last year she was arrested and an order was signed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland revoking a licence under the Good Friday Agreement.  It is maintained by the Pat Finucane Centre that she was never subject to that licence.  No evidence has been produced to dispute that and the pardon seemingly no longer exists.  She was freed under a pardon and does not come under the terms of a licence so how can she be lawfully detained at present under a licence that was never in existence in the first place?</p>
            <p eId="para_114">Serious concerns have been raised about whether her detention meets the lawful standards and I do not believe these have been answered yet.  Will the Tánaiste comment on whether he has discussed where this pardon has gone and why it does not exist, because that was the basis on which she was freed?  It is the contention of the Pat Finucane Centre and others that there was no basis to any licence being revoked.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_115">As I said earlier, there were a number of sentences in this case.  There was a 20-year sentence which, I am informed, was the subject of the royal prerogative.  I am further informed that the royal prerogative did not apply to life sentences which she had been given and that those life sentences are subject to the life licence which was withdrawn by the Secretary of State.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">As I said, we have raised this issue with the Northern Ireland Office and it has advised that the independent parole commissioners considered the terms of the royal prerogative of mercy after receiving submissions on behalf of the prisoner and on behalf of the Secretary of State.  They ruled that the life sentences were not, in fact, remitted by the royal prerogative of mercy and that the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">I did receive a letter from a case worker at the Pat Finucane Centre on 27 March last raising detailed concerns on the legality of the conditions of the detention, and I thanked the centre for communicating these concerns to me.  My officials have followed up with the relevant authorities since then and these contacts are ongoing.  Whatever concerns were raised about the circumstances of detention, there is an obligation to address these concerns and to demonstrate them to be unfounded.  I discussed them with the Secretary of State, Mr. Paterson MP, at our meeting on 27 April.  He has indicated that the case is currently due for review by the parole commissioners and that he will be guided by their decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">I am aware of the concerns surrounding the prisoner's health.  These concerns led to the prisoner being removed from Maghaberry Prison to the medical wing of Hydebank Prison where, I have been informed, medical and prison administration staff are making every effort to make the prisoner comfortable.  Nonetheless, concerns about the prisoner's health persist and I believe these have to be addressed.  I have been advised that a medical expert on behalf of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health has requested an assessment visit.  I have asked to be informed on the outcome of that visit.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_119">On that point, it is the case that health professionals have recommended she should be in hospital and I ask the Tánaiste to take up that question.  He might examine the information on the existence of that royal pardon as stated by the Pat Finucane Centre, which is highly reputable and does not have any agenda or axe to grind.  Seemingly, nobody can put their hands on that pardon and assertions are being made about it without the actual document existing, so the evidential basis of her detention is under serious question and those questions have not been answered.</p>

In respect of whether the royal prerogative applies to the life sentences or whether it applies only to the 20-year sentence, again, the parole commissioners looked at that and they concluded that the life sentences were not remitted by the royal prerogative of mercy and that the prisoner remains subject to life licence.  As I also said, however, when I met the Secretary of State on 27 April, he indicated the case was due for review by the parole commissioners and that he would be guided by their decision.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_123">Despite many promises and commitments to the contrary, the Government has failed abysmally to deal with the mortgage crisis effectively.  There has been a clear lack of urgency, a lack of any commitment to radical action and, indeed, the Government's whole behaviour and response to the mortgage arrears crisis has been one of chronic inactivity.  Mr. Matthew Elderfield is clearly becoming very frustrated with the banks.  He has said that the scale of the problem has overwhelmed the banks and he is extremely concerned about systems and the absence of expertise within the banks to deal with the issue.  Despite the Government's commitments and promises, there are now over 75,000 homeowners unable to pay their mortgage after 90 days, which is 10.5% of homeowners in Ireland.  The comparable figure across the United Kingdom is 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Clearly, this has been allowed to drag on for far too long.  While the mortgage crisis obviously has a very severe impact on the individuals and families concerned, it has a further impact on the wider economy in terms of jobs and a very debilitating impact on economic activity and any sense of dynamic whatsoever.  The lack of transactions in the mortgage market is having a massively negative impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">There is the issue in regard to those in arrears.  The other side of the coin, of course, is that there are people out there who can actually afford to buy houses and who have good credit histories but, again, they are not being facilitated by the banks to buy homes and thereby create significant activity within the market and have a wider impact on the economy.  There is the issue of interest rates, in particular at Permanent TSB, a State-owned bank which is charging higher interest rates than others while its customers are stuck.  They want a fair rate, not for the debt to be written off.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">When can we expect real and decisive intervention by the Government to stem this, deal with the issue and resolve both the personal issues of the people involved and the wider economic situation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_53">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_127">I regard the issue of mortgage arrears as the single biggest issue facing our people at the moment.  In that sense, I am well aware of the figures that were quoted publicly yesterday.  I reject Deputy Martin's assertion that the Government has been chronically inactive in this regard.  Deputy Martin is aware that the Government has taken a number of steps in this regard and has established a specific Cabinet sub-committee which deals with reports from the Central Bank, the banks, the Department of Finance and the other Departments involved.  We increased mortgage interest relief for those who bought their first home at the height of the boom and this had a significant impact for them.  We increased the mortgage interest supplement to help those who lost their jobs to deal with mortgage payments.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency are working on a mortgage-to-rent scheme and a mortgage-to-lease scheme and design of these schemes is under way.  I confirmed for Deputy Martin last week that a great deal of work has been completed on the personal insolvency Bill which will encourage banks to give borrowers a chance to work their way out of their debt problems.  That Bill will be published before the end of June and the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he intends to commence Second Stage of the Bill before the summer recess.  I would like to see that Bill take priority at the end of this session and at the beginning of the next session.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">The Government will also ensure that the Central Bank will have oversight on a range of issues in this regard, including split mortgages, to deal with genuinely distressed mortgage holders, with a determined distinction between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  This will be set out in the mortgage arrears resolution strategies now being finalised by each licensed mortgage lender.  The Central Bank is currently engaging on these with the banks and the sectors involved in different ranges of mortgages are expected to be before Mr. Elderfield shortly.  As Deputy Martin is aware, we have maintained protection, through the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears, for distressed borrowers and specialist expertise in legal banking, project and policy analysis are available.  The Keane report is being followed through and information is available for people who are distressed in respect of their mortgages.  I meet many of these people myself.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The end of December 2011 Central Bank data showed that 70,900 mortgage accounts, or 9.2% of total, are 90 days or more in arrears.  This is up from 63,000.  I would like to think there will be greater impetus from the banks in this regard.  We have had face to face meetings with them on the issue on a number of occasions and I am aware that one bank has put a team of 400 personnel together to sit down with borrowers and work out solutions.  There will be a range of solutions, depending on the circumstances that apply.  I expect the regulator will report to Government at a meeting of the Economic Management Council on the scale of the issues and on how fast we can make progress to achieve a solution.  Nobody wants to see anybody lose his or her house and, as the Deputy knows, this is a very sensitive issue.  However, we must find solutions and there are a range of them in the Keane report and these are being followed through by Government.  I would like to think the banks will show a greater sense of urgency and will sit down with borrowers and, remembering each case is different, work out the best solution so that people can hold on to their houses and not end up in a situation where they will not be able to meet what is a difficult challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">This is the big issue currently and I reject Deputy Martin's assertion that the Government has been chronically inactive on the issue.  We have been very proactive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_131">It seems to me from the Taoiseach's reply that the banks are playing Molly Bawn with him.  His response is incredible: "We have had face to face meetings. We have established a special sub-committee."  Nothing has happened.  The Taoiseach's response is to suggest that the personal insolvency Bill will commence in the autumn.  It will not pass through the House this session and we are looking at the autumn session before it passes through the House.  The Bill will have to be commenced, implemented and regulations made, which means we are talking about Christmas time before it will have any impact, if we are lucky, in terms of legislative solutions that will emanate from the House.  I am absolutely correct to say there is a chronic lack of activity or sense of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The Taoiseach has identified this issue as the biggest social problem.  Along with unemployment, it is clearly the biggest economic and social challenge facing the country.  However, I do see there is any sense of urgency with regard to the personal insolvency Bill in terms of reflecting the scale of the problem as described by the Taoiseach.</p>

This was accepted by the Government on Second Stage, but now it has been allowed stagnate.  Before Christmas, we published the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill, which would give stronger powers to the Financial Ombudsman, but that too has been stalled.  I remember the Taoiseach coming in here and saying he would welcome suggestions from this side of the House.  We brought forward concrete, logical and rational suggestions for debt resolution mechanisms, but none of them has been accepted and no alternatives have come from the Government.  When will we see decisive intervention by the Government in terms of ensuring an effective debt resolution mechanism for people in this country?</p>

As the Deputy knows from experience, every mortgage case is different, depending on the current circumstances of the borrower.  That is the reason driving this issue through a special Cabinet sub-committee is effective, in the sense of requiring the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to report to that committee, along with the Department of Finance, and requiring the banks to come up with plans to deal with this.  The first element of this is to determine the true scale and nature of the mortgages.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">We will not have blanket forgiveness.  Deputy Martin has deliberately misconstrued the scale and complexity of introducing what is probably one of the most complex pieces of legislation, the personal insolvency Bill.  I assure the Deputy that the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance have worked day and night to put this legislation together.  It is an opportunity for a non-judicial recourse to sorting out serious problems of borrowers.  It is far too easy to say nothing is being done.  Following significant focus on it and a great deal of time and attention from the Office of the Attorney General, I expect that legislation to be published in June.  I have no problem with sitting right through the summer to put this legislation through.  If the Seanad has to sit specifically for that purpose, then so be it.  I would like to see it implemented now, but it has been a very complex, tortuous journey.  The Bill will be published at that end of June.  Let us start that process, either in the Dáil or Seanad, as one element of the legislation this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">The Taoiseach has said that the mortgage crisis is the single biggest issue facing our people.  One would never guess that looking at the level of inactivity of the Government on the issue.  Fine Gael promised a lot when it was in opposition and promised a lot in its programme for Government.  The Taoiseach said his Government would pursue a radical approach to protect families in fear of losing their homes.  He is correct that the individual circumstances of mortgage holders differ.  However, the common thread is the gnawing fear families have that they will lose their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">We are 14 months into this Government and it has delivered the Keane report.  That was seven months ago and there has been precious little else.  For people who find themselves in mortgage distress, it is of little comfort to them that the Taoiseach has established a Cabinet sub-committee.  The Taoiseach says he wants to establish the scale of the problem.  The figures are out there.  Some 15% of mortgage holders are now seriously distressed.  That works out to 115,000 households.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, has told us that 25% of all mortgage values are either in arrears or have been restructured.  That is the scale of the problem, and well the Taoiseach knows it.  Under these circumstances why has the personal insolvency Bill been delayed?  Is the Taoiseach allowing the banks and the troika to set the agenda on this matter?  When will the Taoiseach be decisive in putting distressed mortgage holders before bankers or his friends in the troika?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_71">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_150">I reject the Deputy's assertion that we are allowing the banks or the troika to dictate the agenda.  As she is well aware, the Government and the relevant Ministers have made numerous changes to the memorandum of understanding with the troika in respect of the harder pressed, lower paid difficult situations in which many people find themselves.  Of course we know the numbers but the regulator has asked the banks for a report by category and sector to see the ranges involved.  The overall numbers are very distressing and, with numbers rising, this is a matter of absolute concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I do not expect the Cabinet sub-committee, which I formed because of my concern for this, will have all the answers but it has the clout to call in the agencies, the Ministers, the Departments and the banks to get constant updates on what is happening.  I would like to see the report from the Financial Regulator, who knows what he is doing.  He has put pressure on the banks - as has the Government - to categorise this so that we know the sectors and the nature of mortgage distress and people can sit down and say: "In your circumstances we propose the following options."</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Nobody wants to see someone in this country lose a house but it seems clear that some are in dire straits.  There are those for whom solutions can be found, be it through mortgage to rent, split mortgages, trading down or the negative equity opportunities offered in a number of new initiatives.  I understand 1,000 homes were repossessed last year in Northern Ireland.  I do not want to see that on any scale down here, although clearly some people realise the serious difficulties they face.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">As soon as the regulator has the report from the banks we want to determine how it sets out the scale, nature and categories of distressed mortgages.  The personal insolvency Bill is not delayed by virtue of Deputy McDonald's assertion that the banks or the troika run the agenda.  A great deal of work has been done on the Bill and I expect that it will be published in June.  I am sure the Deputy will contribute constructively on the Bill when it comes before the House.  I would like to see it passing through the House before we rise for the summer but it may not be possible to do that.  It is major and complex legislation which deals with something that has never been attempted previously, namely, a non-judicial route for borrowers to get out of their distressed situation.  There is an opportunity for banks to assist in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">The Financial Regulator must be tearing his hair out at this stage.  Yesterday he stated that banks need to do more than offer interest only repayment periods.  That appears to be the only solution on offer.  The Taoiseach seems to be happy to allow the regulator to flap about but he is reluctant to intervene in a decisive way as Head of Government.  Last July the Government recapitalised the pillar banks to the tune of €17 billion.  These banks have the capacity to absorb some of the losses from distressed mortgages but he is not prepared to put pressure on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">The Office of the Taoiseach, which I am proud and honoured to occupy, has the necessary clout but one requires a structure in which to use it.  The structure that I use is to chair relevant Cabinet sub-committees which call in agencies, Ministers and banks as necessary to focus on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Mr. Elderfield was speaking about a mortgage problem causing a bank problem further down the line but the Deputy deliberately misinterpreted him.  She is certainly not an unintelligent person but she deliberately misconstrues the way in which legislation is processed, put together and implemented through the Cabinet or Cabinet sub-committees.  The personal insolvency Bill has not been delayed because it has not been finalised.  The reason it has not been finalised is because of a range of legal, constitutional and other forms of complexity.  When it comes before the House the Deputy will have an opportunity to have her say on how facile or simplistic she appears to think it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The lifetime projections by Blackrock under the PCAR analysis assumed losses on the mortgage of our banks of between €5.7 billion and €9 billion under base and stress case scenarios over the period from 2011 to 2013.  In addition, the banks have achieved better than anticipated prices on the deleveraging of non-core assets and, as a result, have additional capital to cover possible losses in other areas.  In conjunction with the Central Bank, the banks are now implementing strategies to assist people with mortgage arrears on a case-by-case basis because there is no uniform solution to these problems.  Despite the fact that the Deputy might think otherwise, this requires the banks to sit down with individual borrowers and look at the circumstances in which they find themselves before considering the options and attempting to provide a managed way of allowing people to deal with their mortgages keep the roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">That might be too simplistic for Deputy McDonald.  Sinn Féin seems to take the view that it can wave whatever magic baton it carries in its bag to get immediate results.  That is not life.  If the Deputy ever gets the opportunity to understand the way legislation is processed and drafted, she will appreciate it does not happen overnight.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_169">What the Central Bank said yesterday confirmed the tragedy facing so many people in mortgage arrears.  I am worried, however, that yesterday's warnings from the watchdog have not been heard.  The dog that did not bark in 2008 is barking very loudly today.  I hope the Taoiseach has not missed the warning that came from the big guns in the Central Bank, namely, the Governor and the deputy governor.  The deputy governor said he was not comfortable with the behaviour of the bankers.  He went on to say the bankers were "overwhelmed" by the scale of the problem.  We should be very worried about the bigger picture as well as the smaller picture.  His boss, Governor Honohan, also issued a veiled warning.  In Central Bank speak, it was a serious warning.  He said he believed there was no immediate need for new capital.  This gels with the comment of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said that as of today – which was last week – the banks do not need new capital.  What is scary about the mortgage arrears problem is that we are going down a similar road to 2008 because the banks are notably not writing down the loans adequately in their balance sheets.  The Taoiseach was asked to comment on a report from Deutsche Bank issued last Friday.  I understand that he could not comment-----</p>

          <p eId="para_171">-----on the report that the bankers in Ireland were not recognising the problem on their balance sheets and that they are already underproviding for the problem.  This will mean that we must recapitalise.  The warning from Deutsche Bank is that the banks are going down the route that will land us in a second bailout sooner then the end of 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Will the Taoiseach comment on that?  Is this the reason stress tests have been postponed?  Would the banks fail the stress tests that have been postponed because of the underprovision in the mortgage arrears column?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_86">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I welcome the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank and how seriously he is taking his position.  The decision by Danske Bank, which is a Danish bank, was in respect of a write-down of National Irish Bank, which is clearly the decision of the bank.  This is of the most serious concern to the people who face this on a daily basis.  Every Deputy comes across cases on a weekly basis where this stress is causing a problem for families and individuals.  The Keane report, the new initiatives, the Government's decision in respect of mortgage interest, the decision to go down the road of a personal insolvency Bill, which will be published in June, the plan and its structure from each bank and lender, which will be worked through with the Central Bank and presented to the regulator, are all of the utmost importance.  I refer to the necessity to do this as quickly as possible.  The stress tests in respect of banks here, to which Deputy Ross referred, will not be conducted in the autumn but in conjunction with other stress tests for other banks in European countries at the same time.  In this way, no one bank will be singled out for stress tests this autumn as against others in the spring of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The trade down mortgages, the split mortgages, mortgages to lease and to rent and the selling of houses are all matters of the gravest concern to the Government.  Far from the assertion that nothing is happening, we are acutely concerned at the scale of this and the impact on the social well-being of our people.  It essentially boils down to sitting face-to-face with borrowers in respect of their individual circumstances in order to work out a solution in their best interests and in the interests of sorting out an opportunity for them to retain their home, meet their commitments and get on with their lives.  It will not happen in a uniform sense and, in order for it to happen, we must have the accuracy with regard to the nature and categories of the problems.  From a Government point of view, pressure is on the banks to get on with this.  The banks are working with the Central Bank and the regulator with the same intent.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_175">I understand what the Taoiseach is saying but it has nothing to do with what I asked.  Does he recognise that the two top civil servants in the country were issuing a warning, which they did not issue in 2008, that the banks must be recapitalised again because of mortgage arrears?  What is the Government doing about it?  The warning was not reiterated by Danske Bank.  Perhaps the Taoiseach misunderstood me and perhaps my German pronunciation is not very good.  Deutsche Bank is the German bank and Danske Bank owns NIB.  Deutsche Bank said there was a serious danger that Ireland must recapitalise the banks by several billion euro in the very near future because of the absolute refusal of the bankers, who are leading us by the nose, to write off these loans in their books.  If that happens, we are facing a similar situation to 2008, although not as dramatic.  The difference is that this time we will have been warned and will have ignored it.  Last time, they were not warned about it and they got it wrong.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_88">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_176">I am not sure what Deputy Ross is saying we should do.  Is he suggesting the Government should suddenly announce a further recapitalisation of the banks?  That seems to be what he is suggesting.  There is no such evidence of the need for that here.  I take the comments of the two top officials very seriously.  They are serious individuals and the Government is serious in hearing the message they have given us.  That is why the range of initiatives introduced by the Government, to be followed through by the banks in respect of each case, is of the utmost importance.  There is nothing more important to a family under stress because of mounting mortgage arrears.  It is a requirement to understand and know the categories and sectors involved and have the recapitalised lenders sit down to deal with these issues.  Banks have not pursued a rigorous policy of taking people's roofs from over their heads.  A small number of people will find it virtually impossible to meet the requirements of the mortgages they undertook at the height of the property boom but there are other cases where a solution can be achieved to give families relief and allow them to meet their commitments, depending on the options considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">We take into account what the Governor and others have said.  As I pointed out to Deputy McDonald, stress tests showed losses assumed on the mortgage books of between €5.7 billion and €9 billion for 2011 to 2013 under base case and stress case scenarios.  This is a case where the Government is rigorously pursuing, in so far as it can, the solution for each case.  It requires the banks and lenders to sit down with borrowers to work out a solution in each case.  This will have our utmost consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.  The statement of strategy from my Department, published in March, reflects the considerable process of change and restructuring the Department has undergone since I took office.  The Department of the Taoiseach, in its position at the centre of Government, has a very important role to play in supporting me and the rest of Government as we work to secure Ireland's future.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">The statement of strategy outlines the key strategic priorities to be focused on in the period to 2014.  These areas are jobs and growth; Europe; the programme for Government; service; trust; reform; fairness; and peace.  The focus of my Department is to ensure that Government policy in these areas is progressed across the whole of Government.  Through the system of Cabinet committees and senior official groups, key initiatives such as the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work have been given appropriate priority by my Department.  Through these structures, my Department is monitoring progress on the implementation of the action plan for jobs and the first quarterly report was published on 20 April.  My Department will also continue to work closely with other Departments to rebuild Ireland's position at EU level and internationally.  This will be facilitated by the creation of an integrated EU division in the Department.  Ministers and their Departments are, of course, specifically responsible to this House and to the public for policy matters covered within their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The Government is committed to reform of the public service and of the way Government operates in order to become more transparent, accountable and efficient.  In this regard, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is overseeing a major programme of change, for example, in relation to freedom of information legislation, whistleblowers' legislation and regulation of lobbyists.  There are also a significant number of commitments in the programme for Government assigned to my Department relating to constitutional and Oireachtas reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">In addition to its general responsibilities to progress these commitments, my Department will also take specific actions to promote transparency.  The Department already publishes details of foreign travel costs online and will soon be able to publish details of purchase orders worth over €20,000.  It is also considering how best to publish other financial information online on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">The staffing needs of my Department are kept under ongoing review in order to ensure that it meets its strategic objectives.  In addition to staff who transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the enhanced EU division in my Department, further staff have been redeployed from other Departments and a number of specialist temporary staff have been recruited to work on preparations for the EU Presidency.  A number of staff have been seconded to my Department from the National Economic and Social Council and Forfás to assist in policy implementation.  My Department will continue to change, develop and strengthen its capacity and expertise in light of emerging challenges and priorities.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_188">In the spirit of transparency to which the Taoiseach referred in his reply, have any retired civil servants returned to work in his Department?  There has been considerable public commentary about this phenomenon of civil servants leaving on pension and returning, in some cases to the same Department.  Common sense dictates at a time of high unemployment that when vacancies arise within the service those positions should be filled by some of the many thousands of skilled people who find themselves on the dole queues or in the airport departure lounges.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify whether any position in his Department is filled by a person who has returned after retirement.  I ask for his view on this phenomenon in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The Taoiseach has said that jobs and growth are a key priority for his Department and this is welcome.  How does he see his role and that of his Department in the delivery of any economic stimulus plan?  What is the role of his Department in overseeing the delivery of action plans for job creation?  His strategy statement makes clear the need to avoid what is termed group think and I presume this arises from the findings of the Nyberg report, the Regling Watson report and the Honohan report.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">In recent weeks we have heard how repeated cautions by a Department of Finance official in 2005 of the impending economic crash, were persistently removed from public statements and from responses to priority questions.  What steps has the Government taken to avoid a repetition of any such scenario?</p>

            <p eId="para_191">To my knowledge, there is nobody in the Department of the Taoiseach who has been rehired following retirement.  I will check this information for the Deputy to ensure its accuracy but I do not believe this to be the case.  On the general policy of rehiring people following retirement, the Minister for State, Deputy Brian Hayes dealt with this issue last week in the matter of the rehiring of a number of specialists who returned on contract.  For example, in the case of members of the teaching profession, their employer is the board of management of a school and the Department of Education and Skills acts as the paymaster general.  The Government made a clear decision early this year that teachers who retired under the voluntary scheme at the end of February and who were teaching the junior certificate and leaving examination classes, could be rehired to continue with their classes until the end of the examination period because of the special bond between teachers of examination classes and their pupils.  We did not wish to see disruption caused to those classes if the teachers were replaced by new personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">The Deputy will be aware of the issue of the employment of a number of hired veterinary surgeons to carry out inspections in meat factories.  These are taken from a long list of veterinary practitioners, the vast majority of whom are in private practice.  I do not wish to speak further as a Supreme Court case is pending and the Department closed the list some time ago.  As a general principle it is my view that when people retire on pension or gratuity, the opportunities for work should be available to new people who will have that extra enthusiasm and energy for the work.  I acknowledge there are cases where particular specialists may be required on a contract basis but as a general principle I believe that when people retire this means retirement rather than a return to work as described by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">As for overseeing the delivery of an economic stimulus or action plan, the Office of the Taoiseach, through the Cabinet sub-committees, has the opportunity to call together the agencies and the Ministers and to organise the time line for required actions.  I am not suggesting that this does not happen but in order to avoid an occasional drift it is very important to have a regular assessment of progress on the action plan.  This is the reason for the special section in my Department which includes personnel from Forfás.  Together with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, this section monitors and oversees the jobs action plan which was published in February.  The plan contains 270 proposals specifically designed for the small and medium enterprises and small businesses sector.  This section in my Department is constantly engaged with Secretaries General, Ministers and Ministers of State in regard to the quarterly schedule of issues and actions that need to be addressed, decided upon and implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">I believe the response was approximately 96% in the first quarterly report of that action programme.  This may be the easy section and the next section may be more difficult because some of the issues are more complex.  I have direct and regular contact with that section of my Department, which cuts across all those other Departments, and I see how those action plans are being implemented.  The same applies in regard to the programme for Government as the section is in constant contact with the Ministers and their Secretaries General to ensure the Government plan is implemented in full over its period.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The Deputy asked how I can ensure there will not be a repeat of what happened in the past.  I can report that the entire regime has changed and there is now a new emphasis on openness and transparency in the Department of the Taoiseach with a new Secretary General who has considerable experience and who wants to be very proactive in dealing with people.  That is why these measures will be published online and ongoing financial transactions will be published monthly for the information of the public and everyone else.  I hope that regular meetings between the senior officials of the Department of the Taoiseach and myself will ensure that the areas of responsibility of the Department and of the Government are followed through rigorously and actions which should be accomplished within a particular timescale are seen to happen, all in the interests of better services for everybody.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_198">I have raised the Taoiseach's role in tackling the jobs crisis, as outlined in his Department's strategy statement.  I asked him to make a statement on the matter as well as outlining the policy areas for which his Department is responsible, and whether his Department is adequately staffed.  The Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, loves to choose his words carefully.  Whether he is trying to rock the foundations of the State or just getting a laugh, he does not speak without thinking things through.  It was therefore very revealing that he recently told a group of energy executives that the Government does not have a plan for the economy.  This was reported in the <i> Sunday Independent.</i>  He said the Government was essentially reacting on a day-by-day basis.  Cutting through the spin, it seems there is a lot of hype about things but very little is actually happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">The Department of the Taoiseach basically has the same staff as it had 18 months ago, but his office's role in formulating economic policy has been significantly reduced.  His office hosts a lot of meetings, but he has removed most of the staff whose responsibility was to co-ordinate and deliver a jobs strategy.  Would the Taoiseach agree that is one of the reasons the jobs strategy, which was launched last year, comprises over 90% of re-published existing strategies?  There is nothing new or very fresh in that jobs strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Given the admission by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, that the Government does not have a strategic plan for the economy, should the Taoiseach not take genuine control of the situation and direct proper strategic economic planning within Government?  His Ministers are clearly of the view that no such strategic plan exists.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_95">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_201">I reject the report, that I have heard about, of comments attributed to and alleged to have been made by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  He was clear and categoric in his response to that, stating that no such thing was said by him.  In the past, there were parallel departments of finance.  There was a semblance of a department of finance in the Department of the Taoiseach, keeping a close eye on what was happening in the Department of Finance itself.  For quite some time in the past, we had evidence of the scarcity of qualified people to drive economic policy in the country, but that has changed.  The Government has a clear plan for dealing with our economic problems and woes, which is partly related to the programme for Government.  It is also related to the fact that we are in a bailout programme and must get our deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015.  We must also consistently work with and renegotiate elements of the memorandum of understanding with the troika, and reduce our debt.  In addition, we must grow our economy thus providing opportunities for business to grow, exports to expand and jobs to be created.  Contrary to the Deputy's allegation, the Government has a clear plan which we are following through to develop our economy and provide those opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">In so far as the formulation of economic policy is concerned, Deputy Martin is aware that I chair the Economic Management Council, which deals with issues of an economic nature that arise prior to their being presented to Government.  At the council we have a direct input, assessment and discussion about each of these issues.  In addition, as director of the Cabinet agenda, I follow through with my colleagues discussions on the formulation of economic policy and how that should be decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">In appointing Ministers, the Taoiseach allocates responsibility and those responsibilities should be lived up to.  There is no need for extensive duplication in Departments, with one doing the same as another.  There are clear guidelines as well as a clear structure and strategy.  If Ministers are having problems with a particular issue we discuss it, release the blockage and get on with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">From the perspective of the Office of the Taoiseach, it is achievable to have fixed times for responses to various stages of whatever action might be being followed.  In that sense, economic policy formulation is discussed with Ministers, organisations and groups across a broad spectrum prior to these policies being finalised.  Deputy Martin says that nothing new has happened here, but when I launched the jobs action programme with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I said that quite a number of good suggestions were made in the past, including when Deputy Martin was in government.  However, they were never acted upon; they were left lying in reports which gathered dust on shelves in various Departments, having been paid for by the taxpayer.  I make no apology for saying openly that a number of those proposals were there for years.  I see no reason they should not be implemented now if they are good suggestions of a practical nature that will help business to flourish and increase job creation opportunities.  When the jobs action plan was published, I said that these were not all new ideas from this Government.  A number of them had been there for some time, but were never followed through.  They will be followed through now.  There is a specific section in the Department of the Taoiseach to see that this actually happens, with assistance from redeployed personnel from Forfás.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">It means that when Ministers come before Cabinet sub-committees they are requested to report on progress in so far as how items, for which they have responsibility, on the jobs action plan are behaving.  They know that the next quarterly publication will be made public, so it is in their own interests to make decisions within their Departments.  It is not just a question of saying that they have done this, but also of outlining its impact and effectiveness.  This must be seen by the wider business community as helping to achieve our ambition of demonstrating that, by 2016, we will be the best small country in which to do business.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_206">I am glad the Taoiseach has clarified that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, denies that he made the remarks attributed to him at the weekend.  In the context of transparency, I also take it as an adamant denial of any suggestion that the Minister told the executives present that this was not to be spoken about afterwards, and that he did not want his remarks to be re-articulated or published subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">I put it to the Taoiseach, however, that the jobs strategy is not working.  At the time the growth target was set by the Government, everybody said it would not happen.  The Government has belatedly acknowledged that its growth target will not work.  As far back as the budget, the Government's own documentation was predicting an increase in unemployment this year.  Therefore there is no evidence whatsoever that the jobs strategy is up to the game, given the scale of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">There is no specific targeting of youth unemployment.  We published a youth employment strategy last week with a view to getting a political consensus around the idea of focusing proactively on young people and the predicament they face in this crisis, which is the worst globally since the 1930s.  We need to take extra measures and engage in out of the box thinking in order to help young people leaving schools and colleges to gain work or, at least, be put on the pathway to employment by gaining valuable experience through internships and thus securing jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">I do not accept the Taoiseach's political point about previous plans not being followed through.  It is clear that the work we did with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in recent years has borne fruit.  For quite some time, the country's essential industrial strategy has worked for foreign direct investment.  In addition, the reform and re-priorisitising of Enterprise Ireland's strategic objectives have worked to help Irish-owned companies grow and export.  The development of a venture capital fund strategy happened quite a number of years ago through Enterprise Ireland, in the absence of the private sector.    All of that has been effective but the current crisis has impacted most on the domestic economy, on the retail sector, in particular, and the hospitality sector, in terms of construction.  I do not see a jobs strategy across all sectors in any response or sense of a series of measures being devised to assist those sectors earn some breathing space to come through this crisis.  The Government stands indicted in terms of a lack of creative thinking-----</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_220">Deputy Martin said that the jobs strategy is not working.  It would be wonderful to be able to report job creation figures like we had back in the 1990s when the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, was announcing 1,000 new jobs a week.  Clearly, it is the kind of economic policy position to which we would like to return, where we were competitive, export driven and jobs were being created at significant levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">It is true to say that the current strategy has realised 1,000 new foreign investment jobs a month over the past period and that employment has stabilised.  While the unemployment numbers are much too high, we are creating more jobs than are now being lost, which is a sign of confidence in its own way.  The figures for growth have been revised to 0.7% increase for this year, which is very much in excess of the eurozone and euro area in general, and it is projected to be 2% for next year.  These figures have been referred to by other independent commentators.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">I put it to the Deputy that there already 5,000 places on the Springboard scheme, announced by the Department of Education and Skills.  Only yesterday the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced a further 6,000 higher educations places for the unemployed.  There are more than 5,000 places for young unemployed graduates on the JobBridge scheme, which is private sector driven and has been of enormous significance.  When one speaks to employers who have taken on young graduates who are employed on that scheme, the majority of them are exceptionally pleased with the quality of the young personnel they get and many assume responsibilities permanently in those places.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is following through the Pathways to Work scheme, which affects the young and not so young.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">From that point of view changes have had to be made here.  The Deputy will be well aware that when his party was in government and small businesses approached banks, money was provided hand over fist as if there was never a requirement to pay anything but that is not the situation now.  That is the reason the Government published the legislation in respect of partial loan credit guarantees in order that small and medium enterprises can have the flexibility, working with banks, to be able to draw and have access to credit, which we discussed last week, in the interests of employment and taking on new people.  The same applies in the case of the micro-finance agency, a model of which is now to be worked on, which should provide up to €100 million for lending to small enterprises at commercial rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">The Deputy mentioned issues such as the situation that applies here in general for business.  There is no doubt that the retail sector is under pressure.  If one travels to any town in the country, one can see evidence of that.  There are reasons for it in terms of a lack of confidence and a loss of consumer confidence.  That is the reason that for each of the last four months, despite the capacity to spend consumers are making other choices.  It took some persistence to restore clarity and decisiveness about our corporation tax situation, about which there was some confusion and misinterpretation last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">We have messed around in this country for a long time with our strategy to deal effectively with the broadband issue.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is now dealing with that and world class speeds can become available to business and a programme for the next young generation is being connected to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">The Deputy mentioned the hospitality sector.  The decision to reduce VAT to 9% from 13% has resulted in 11,000 jobs in that sector.  If the Deputy talks to those working in the sector, they will tell him that it has been a direct injection to their benefit.  The same applied in the case of the reduction of PRSI for employers for the lower paid.  The Government has set out its strategy for the next year in the hospitality sector for the Gathering.  We hope to being in another 350,000 people to the country during the course of 2013 for those occasions, which will be of direct extra benefit to the hospitality sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">These are challenging times, as the Deputy is aware.  I do not accept that the jobs strategy is not working.  It is now beginning to have effect.  In dealing with 400,000 people on the live register - 130,000 of whom work three-day weeks and part-time and others who sign on while they are retired until they reach pension age - clearly, those who require significant  motivation are those who are in a rut, who do not see any hope or do not have the confidence to project themselves in a way that possibly they can.  The Pathways to Work, Springboard and JobBridge schemes and other areas, plus decisions to put responsibility down to local authority level for enterprise boards and enterprise operations will have a significant impact in the months ahead.  For its part, the Government's priority will be to focus on that jobs and business area, clear those blockages and open those doors in order that business will have a genuine environment in which to thrive.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">The Economic Management Council has met 55 times since its establishment.  The members met 18 times so far this year, most recently on 16 May and five times since the Easter recess.  The Government intends to work closely with the Irish banks to ensure that the banking sector supports economic recovery.  The members of the council last met with the banks on 21 February.  As part of this ongoing process, I expect that members of the Economic Management Council will meet with the banks again in the not too distant future.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The membership of the Economic Management Council consists of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The support for the Economic Management Council is a core function of my Department and is undertaken in addition to other responsibilities of the staff involved, with assistance from other Departments, as may be appropriate.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_108">
            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_238">I read in a briefing note that the function of the Economic Management Council is to manage the Government's programme in respect of economic planning and budgetary matters, economic recovery programmes, including the representation of Ireland in negotiations with the European Union, the IMF and the European Central Bank, and that additional support for the council is provided from within the existing resources of the Taoiseach's Department, working in close conjunction with staff from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In view of that mandate for the Economic Management Council and of the fact that it has met 18 times this year, is it not incredible that the Irish people are not getting a single assessment from the Taoiseach of the economic impact of the fiscal rules straitjacket he agreed in Brussels at the summit of European leaders in December?  In the course of the hundreds of hours of media debate and discussion, and the Taoiseach's side allegedly putting out information, we have had no idea of the fiscal impact of the new fiscal rules the Taoiseach proposes to enshrine in Irish law and to agree by treaty.  Will the Taoiseach explain why this is the case?  Is it not really shameful that instead of an honest attempt to lay out the implications of the permanent austerity rules the Taoiseach seeks to frighten our people?  Will he correct this urgently so in the coming week the Irish people can have as objective information as possible, based on the projections of the Department of Finance and others, on how the new fiscal rules would impact on the economy from 2015?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_109">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_239">I do not accept Deputy Higgins's assertion.  He knows very well what the fiscal impact will be because the treaty states it quite clearly.  A "Yes" vote guarantees access to the ESM.  A "No" vote guarantees no access to the ESM.  Deputy Higgins does not have to take my word for it; I am quite sure he respects Mr. Justice Feeney and the other members of the independent Referendum Commission who are absolutely impartial, apolitical and utterly focused on telling the people the reality and the truth about what will be the fiscal impact here.  Deputy Higgins does not have to accept my word for it.  I am quite sure he will not deny accuracy and truth to the chairman of the independent Referendum Commission.  The commission has made it perfectly clear a "Yes" vote would guarantee access to the ESM if it were ever required.</p>
            <p eId="para_240">It is equally clear that much of what is in the fiscal stability treaty has already been enshrined in European Union legislation be it through the six pack measures or the Stability and Growth Pact.  The difference will be that everybody will have to adhere to these conditions, big countries as well as small countries.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the past big countries broke the Stability and Growth Pact and did not suffer any consequences.  The new situation will bring good housekeeping to the fore which will ensure no future Irish Government or collection of parties will ever again be able to run away with the people's money.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">Several weeks ago Deputy Higgins and those who support his call for a "No" vote called for the vetoing of the ESM and Sinn Féin was stating the IMF and the EU should take their money, get out of here and leave us alone.  Now they state that of course on the day we will have access to all of these funds but with no indication of what the fiscal impact might be.  In other words, when Deputy Higgins states the treaty leaves us with an austerity programme, I would like to know what is his view of the interest rate one would pay if one was to follow his proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">His question is about the fiscal impact.  The fiscal impact is that the country will have access to the ESM if ever it requires it.  More important are the jobs I discussed earlier with Deputy Martin from the multinational investors which are very clear, decisive, deliberate and large.  Each of them reduces the deficit by €20,000.  These matters speak for themselves.  They have confidence in our people and country because of our tax record, technology and talent pool.  We want this to continue.  We might not win all of the jobs, but a "Yes" vote guarantees significant interest in investing in our country will continue.  A "Yes" vote guarantees access to the insurance of the permanent fund for all European countries were it ever to be required.  It also allows us to apply good housekeeping rules here.  Deputy Higgins is well aware the less interest one pays and the less in debt one is, the more one has to spend on important facilities such as schools, primary care centres and front line services because the money is not required to be paid on high interest rates because of decisions taken in the past.  This is the situation.</p>

Perhaps I will have better success the second time.  The Taoiseach is absolutely wrong that a country which does not sign the austerity pact will not have access to the ESM.</p>

            <p eId="para_270">It is perfectly clear, as the chairman of the independent referendum commission has pointed out, that only those countries that ratify this fiscal stability treaty will have access to the ESM.  It is difficult to predict accurately what the scale and nature of each individual country's plan will be to get down to 60% and 0.5% starting after 2019 because the growth figures that will be driven from this country will have a dramatic impact on the scale of that.  We had this previously.

            <p eId="para_327">The Economic Management Council has had a number of meetings with the bank.  Any meeting with the bank did not actually constitute, in itself, a Cabinet sub-committee.  So I can say to the House and to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Government had a series of detailed questions for the banks, which we met collectively and individually.  We asked about how the banks are ensuring SME credit targets will be met; practical initiatives to ensure and assist SMEs access credit, which is a big issue and was discussed last week; and willingness to implement and support the Government's action plan for jobs for small business - we got reassurance on a number of those issues.  We also asked about mortgage credit; how banks are ensuring that credit is available to support the Government's budget initiative; the checks and balances being put in to ensure that the conditions on mortgage credit are fair and balanced, and not unduly restrictive; whether banks are monitoring outcomes between different regions; the situation that applies in the case of mortgage arrears; and the strategy for each of the banks.  We discussed examples of how banks are assisting those in difficulties.  We asked about progress in respect of the Keane report; when their teams will be in place to sit down with individuals who are in mortgage distress, negative equity and very concerned about their positions; and when they expect to provide their reports to Mr. Elderfield for consideration of the sectors and the categories involved here.</p>
            <p eId="para_328">These are all issues that were discussed with the banks.  I assure the Deputy that there was a comprehensive discussion of the financial situation of many people, access to credit, mortgage distress and mortgage arrears.  While I am no favourite of the banks, I must say that their plans - if they follow through on them - were very constructive in a number of areas and I would like to see them happen.  We need a banking system that has the trust of people and works in the interest of business.  From travelling around the country - sometimes meeting some of the Deputy's colleagues - I find that the younger generation working in the banks work exceptionally hard and take the brunt of the stick which was not due to them in the first place because of decisions made higher up.  I will be happy to report to the House on a regular basis on the progress being made here.</p>
            <p eId="para_329">To clarify, that was one of a number of regular meetings with the banks which, of itself, did not constitute a Cabinet sub-committee.  The EMC is such a committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_332">When the Economic Management Council was established, the Taoiseach said it would ensure that projections for growth and other matters were fully accurate.  He also talked about how items would be reviewed intensively.  The Taoiseach placed great store on it.  Since then, he has done everything but admit that the growth projections from December were wrong, almost from the moment they were published.  This goes to the heart of the credibility of the Economic Management Council.  The IMF and the EU downgraded the growth forecasts very early but it took the Government a long time to follow suit.</p>
            <p eId="para_333">The Government is now predicting lower growth rates, lower GDP, lower job creation, higher unemployment, lower real wage growth and higher public debt than it was predicting 12 months ago.  Some of the variations over the 12 months are significant.  The average projected growth of GDP from 2012 to 2015 was 2.9%, but that has been revised down to 2.2%.  Projected growth of GNP has been revised down from 2.4% to 1.4%.  Average annual investment growth has been revised down from 4% to 1.8% over that period.  Nominal GDP has been revised down from €182.7 billion to €178 billion.  Net job creation from 2011 to 2015 was projected last year to be 101,000; this April the Government is projecting that it will be 61,000 over that same period.  That is a decline of 40,000 jobs in the forecast.</p>

            <p eId="para_342">With regard to the membership of the EMC, there was a public dispute recently between the Government parties about who sits on the EMC and what its role is.  Labour Party Ministers told journalists that the briefing which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, made against the Tánaiste some time ago was motivated by jealousy over not attending the EMC.  Did the Taoiseach speak to those involved at that time?  Ministers regularly complain to journalists that the Cabinet is marginalised on economic issues because of the Economic Management Council.  They say that what it does, in essence, is take economic items off the Cabinet agenda without really adding anything extra.  Has the Taoiseach examined the membership of the EMC and its relationship with the Cabinet's deliberations on broader economic issues?</p>
            <p eId="para_343">I believe the EMC was a minor initiative which was over spun, like many others at the time the Government was formed.  It is a small Cabinet committee with little support and, already, a poor record after 12 months in existence in terms of growth projections and so forth.  We discussed mortgage arrears earlier.  There has been no sense that the EMC has had any effectual impact on the mortgage arrears crisis.  We dealt with that earlier in Leaders' Questions.  Will the Taoiseach discuss the growth projections and will he comment on the EMC?</p>

            <p eId="para_346">The EMC met 55 times.  It has a real work programme.  The membership comprises myself, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The council is served by civil and public servants, as is appropriate.  I have no interest in allegations or assertions as to who said what in anonymous reports in newspapers.  The Ministers attend Cabinet sub-committees as required.  As I said to Deputy McDonald, the value of this from my perspective is that once a strategy or pathway is laid out for whatever action or economic matter is being considered, there is a time line included and Ministers and Departments are expected to respond, which they do.  The public service responds very well to clarity of requirement or decision and the time in which it must be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">On May 8, I received a reply to a parliamentary question stating this country could not ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities because the legislative framework was not yet in place.  One of the key aspects of the legislative framework is No. 25 in the legislative programme, namely, the mental capacity Bill.  Although campaigners in the area were promised the Bill would be published in April, it is yet to be published.  Will the Bill be published this month or when will it be published.</p>

It is important legislation to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in respect of forfeiting the proceeds of crime.  Finally, the criminal law (human trafficking) (amendment) Bill is equally important and has been promised for a considerable period.

          <p eId="para_458">I wish to raise two points from this legislation.  As for the strategic investment bank, when should Members expect legislation to be brought forward in this regard?  It has been a major policy position of the Government in respect of getting people back to work.  As Members have heard already what is happening in Donegal, there is a need for such initiatives.  One year after the formation of the Government, when will Members have sight of this legislation?  The second legislative item is No. 66 on the legislative programme, namely, the electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  I note have raised this issue previously.  The polling date for islands has been set for of May 28.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Taoiseach will be aware that people who, owing to their occupations are entitled to a postal vote, are being denied their constitutional right to vote because as the date for polling on the islands is not announced on the same day as is the date for polling on the mainland they were not able to include that date on their application form for a postal vote and the date for such applications has now closed.  It is wrong that this is happening on some of our larger islands in particular.  For example, Arranmore, which has a helipad, to and from which ferries operated every day last year and which has a helipad.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_329">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_477">I am pleased to have this opportunity to brief the House ahead of the informal meeting of the European Council which will take place tomorrow in Brussels.  President Van Rompuy has convened this meeting at this sensitive time to provide an opportunity for an open and informal debate on how we can move ahead with urgency to boost growth and jobs across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">There is no issue more pressing for our country than that we bolster the successful efforts under way here to create jobs and develop a sustainable pathway back to growth.  All of our painful efforts to adjust are in the interests of securing that renewed growth, investor confidence and, as a consequence, jobs.  We need these jobs and that growth and require a stable eurozone to deliver this.  We want to see some fresh thinking and courageous action at EU level to sustain those goals.  I believe tomorrow's meeting opens an important new chapter.  We want to see the EU harness our combined strengths to achieve stability and recovery for the eurozone, Europe and, of course, for Ireland.  The discussions tomorrow night will focus on that.  The intention is that we will not at this stage take decisions or draw conclusions, rather we will have a comprehensive discussion designed to pave the way politically for decisions at our meeting at the end of June.  I intend to be an active contributor to that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I welcome this opportunity for what I hope will be a frank and comprehensive discussion.  We are confronting a most serious situation in the eurozone and more widely.  If we are to rise to the challenge, our approach must be a balanced one.  As the Government has argued time and again, a growth-oriented focus is the essential complement to the efforts at consolidation and reform under way.  The stability treaty is a vital component but it is not the full picture.  Tomorrow's discussion will be important in setting out the further steps that must now be taken.  If we emerge with a clear set of common understandings among all EU leaders about what needs to be done we will have made important headway.  We do not come to the table with a blank slate.  We will be building on work already done, including at our meetings in January and March.  However, there is now new momentum behind the drive for growth and we need to seize the opportunity to make real and substantial progress.  It is my sincere hope that tomorrow's discussion will begin the process of looking ahead to the type of economic and monetary union, EMU, which may best serve the euro area and the European Union in the years and decades ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In his letter ahead of the meeting, President Van Rompuy has called for focus on four elements, including building blocks of a growth strategy, consistent with the Commission's statement of 9 May on "seizing the moment to boost growth".  The first building block is the pursuit of sound national economic policies within the framework of the European semester.  This now includes the six pack cornerstone for maintaining a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation strategy and for avoiding macro-economic slippages.  President Van Rompuy will invite the President of the Commission to provide a preliminary assessment of national reform programmes, NRPs, under the Europe 2020 strategy which were submitted in April and to look ahead to the package of proposals which the Commission will adopt on 30 May, notably its country specific recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">As a party to an EU-IMF programme of financial support, Ireland was not required to submit a separate NRP for 2012.  We already undergo rigorous reporting under the programme and the Commission was of the view that this meets the reporting requirements for the NRPs.  However, the Government decided to go beyond its obligations and to provide comprehensive feedback to the Commission.  Our NRP update was submitted in April along with our stability programme update.  It provides a review of progress made under the five headline targets, namely, employment, research and development, climate change, education and poverty.  It also takes into account our national response to President Barroso's initiative on youth unemployment and SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The second building block highlighted by President Van Rompuy in his letter of 26 April is EU policies bringing added value.  Ireland looks forward to the Commission's proposals in the second half of the year for a new round of measures under the Single Market Act.  This will be an important focus for our Presidency next year.  I particularly welcome President Van Rompuy's emphasis on the role of external trade as a driver of growth and jobs.  The EU is in the process of negotiating major agreements with important partners and we look forward to further progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The third building block highlighted by President Van Rompuy is measures improving the financing of the economy. There are now a number of concrete initiatives receiving active consideration, including those highlighted by President Hollande.  I expect this list to grow in the period ahead.  Many of the ideas are promising but each will need to be closely assessed for its potential impact upon this country.  President Van Rompuy mentions in particular that the role of the European Investment Bank could be better mobilised to support SMEs and key infrastructure through an increase in its capital and a strengthening of existing joint instruments.  This would be helpful.  For our part, we will be working to ensure that resulting funds are available to those who need them most and that SME access to finance remains a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">In so far as project bonds are concerned, we want to ensure that the arrangements are suitable for member states like Ireland and that the scale of projects is not an obstacle to good investments that can actually deliver real growth and jobs.  Negotiations are ongoing on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-20.  There is already agreement that this should be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy but we will aim to give it a greater focus on growth and jobs.  I will be making the point to my colleagues that we see the agri-food industry as a key and highly dynamic engine for innovation, growth and quality jobs.  European investment in this sector remains evidence of money well spent.  As we reach the end of the current EU budget, there are funds that member states have not been able to use.  We need to examine how these can be redirected towards growth.  We want the focus to be on those who need them most and on those who can make best use of them, including in tackling unemployment in countries like Ireland which face the greatest challenges.  President Van Rompuy also mentions the difficult issue of a possible financial transaction tax, FTT, which some have suggested as a possible source of funds for stimulus.  Our position on this is well known.  We remain opposed to anything that would place us at a competitive disadvantage, as are a significant number of like-minded countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The fourth building block highlighted by President Van Rompuy is measures to strengthen job creation, embracing national and EU policies.  Aside from national efforts here in Ireland, including the Action Plan on Jobs and the Pathways to Work initiative, President Barroso will inform the meeting of the work the Commission is carrying out with the eight member states, including Ireland, with particularly high youth unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">A team from the Commission visited in February and met with officials from relevant Departments to explore ways to combat youth unemployment and increase supports for small and medium-sized enterprises.  As we have no unallocated Structural Funds, the emphasis in Ireland is on any potential to refocus employment programmes to better effect, consistent with the direction set by our pathways to work initiative.  This, of course, includes learning from what is working well in other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">As well as elaborating upon the broad range of growth-related issues, President Van Rompuy has also encouraged European Council members to engage in innovative thinking.  Given what we have been through as a currency union over the last number of years, we need to give serious consideration to ideas which, even up to very recently, would have seemed insurmountably difficult to some.  These ideas might include, but are not limited to, eurobonds and the possibility of revisiting the mandate of the European Central Bank.  We need to reflect calmly and soberly on what sort of European monetary union will best serve us in the medium to long term.  Engaging in such thinking should provide a positive signal to both the financial markets and our people that we remain determined to do all that is necessary to correct weaknesses in the EMU brought into focus by the current crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Although we will focus on the growth and jobs agenda tomorrow, we should not lose sight of the importance of the stability treaty on which the Irish people will vote in just over a week's time.  The responsible budgetary rules set out in the stability treaty, to which 25 countries have signed up, are a critical foundation stone on which we can build sustainable jobs and growth.  Fiscal responsibility, which transparently holds each euro area member state to account for the commitments which they entered into, is fundamentally in Ireland's interest and in the interests of our shared common currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Any serious efforts to boost growth, in particular job-creating growth, whether they be national or European ideas, will be fatally holed below the waterline if we do not get our budgetary house in order at the same time.  That is exactly what this Government has been doing since coming to office last year.  Growth and stability are two sides of the one coin: on the one side, bringing our deficit under control, and, on the other, giving our economy a growth stimulus which will boost our growth rates and job creation.  This growth will lighten our debt load which, in turn, will encourage further growth.  We need to create a positively reinforcing virtuous cycle of growth, jobs and falling relative debt levels.  We have done this before as an economy and as a society and it is something we will do again.  Approving the stability treaty is an important step on the way to getting on to such a positive cycle.  I believe the Irish people appreciate that and will reflect it in their votes on Thursday week.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">As would be expected, tomorrow's informal meeting will also touch upon recent developments in the eurozone.  The current situation in a number of member states raises real concerns for every euro area member state.  Within a currency union we are intrinsically linked to one another and the negative shift in our bond yields in the secondary markets are a most concrete and unwelcome reaffirmation of this.  The situation in Greece remains the most pressing.  It is, of course, a sovereign matter for the Greek people to decide the composition of their next government when they come to vote again next month.  Let me state, very clearly, that I want Greece to remain in the euro area.  I want Greece to implement the terms of the programmes it has agreed.  Both of these are important for the stability of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I also wish to express my support for the efforts being made by the Spanish authorities to identify and address issues in their banking sector.  As we have seen in this country, getting to grips, no matter how painful, with the banking sector, including insuring that banks are properly capitalised, is a prerequisite for emerging from this crisis and returning even to the most modest levels of growth.  Tomorrow's informal meeting of the European Council will allow EU leaders to reflect freely and openly upon how best we can work together to restore growth and job creation to our Union.  There is no more vital task.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I hope we will reach the broadest possible understanding among Heads of State or Government of what needs to be done so that appropriate decisions can be taken when we meet again next month.  I will continue to take a strong and proactive stance in support of any and every initiative which will deliver sustainable jobs and growth to this country and across the EU.  I will be happy to return to the House next week, or whenever is appropriate, and report to Members on the meeting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_330">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_493">The meeting which starts tonight is the direct result of the consistent failure of Europe's leaders to address this crisis with the urgency it requires.  In summit after summit, the action taken has always been the minimum required to get through the next few weeks or months.  The dominant theme has been an effort to make pre-crisis policies work rather than to adopt the radical departures that are clearly needed.  Each significant move has been as the result of an emergency and so the Union has consistently failed to keep pace with the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">If many of the policies in place today had been agreed two years ago, it is likely the Irish and Portuguese bailouts could have been avoided.  The eurozone would not be facing a threat to its very existence.  However, they were resisted and the crisis was allowed to spiral.  The December set of agreements have, as predicted, proven to be inadequate.  They have failed and we are now in a situation where more radical action is required.  The situation is much graver than it has been at any time in the past three years because the room for manoeuvre and delay is over.  The crisis is reaching its final stage, which will see either dramatic action to save the euro and restore growth or the setting off of a chain of events which may be impossible to contain.  The situation today is that preparations are already under way to manage the possible departure of a state from the euro.  There is a steady run on eurozone banks, with vulture funds lining up to try to exploit the situation.  Sovereign borrowing is reaching possibly unsustainable levels for many countries.  Most important, and unfortunately, there is no faith whatsoever that Europe's leaders understand what must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Although others in this House have either ignored the crisis or focused on getting short-term political benefit from it, I and my party have been consistent in calling for and proposing a set of actions to contain the sovereign debt crisis, reform the eurozone and restore growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The design of the euro is deeply flawed and lies at the heart of everything which has happened during the past three years.  This is recognised by the architect of the euro, Jacques Delors, and by nearly every independent expert.  The OECD's commentary of today is the latest to set out the simple truth: change core policies of the eurozone or allow a much deeper and destructive crisis to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The eurozone has the resources within its borders to get through this crisis.  It is one of the world's wealthiest regions.  Its aggregate fiscal, trade and financial situation is very strong.  It can overcome any of the challenges which face it today.  The only issue is whether it is willing to adopt the policies required.  It is also important to reiterate that the euro is worth saving.  It has enabled growth and rising standards of living which, in most places, have not been completely undone by the crisis.  In Ireland, it still supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.  At this meeting, and over the coming weeks, what Europe needs is for its leaders to agree more radical action to restore confidence and growth to Europe.  Only when they show they understand the scale of what is required will progress be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The deal that is desperately needed is one which achieves three basic outcomes.  First, it must tackle the sovereign debt crisis by establishing a more secure and bigger facility for buying government bonds.  Second, it must tackle the financial crisis by ensuring that banks are capitalised to a level where their long-term survival is unquestioned, including dealing with Irish bank and mortgage debts.  Third, it must tackle the jobs crisis by using the eurozone's enormous resources to deliver immediate job-creating investment.  What will not do is the minimalist collection of half-measures and over-hyped statements of intent which have followed most summits for the past year.  Unfortunately, the early indications about the agenda are not encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Before I speak about the action that is needed to save the eurozone, it is important for me to put next week's referendum in context.  Every day, it is becoming clearer that an Irish "Yes" vote is essential if Europe is to return to stability and growth.  The stability treaty is not the only solution to the crisis.  Fiscal policies did not cause the crisis.  Those like the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues who pretended they did wasted a great deal of critical time.  However, a determination to run sustainable fiscal policies is a vital part of the solution to the crisis.  If states are to be able to borrow to fund their public services, we must restore confidence in budget policies.  The consequence of any failure in this challenge would be austerity on a scale far beyond anything we have experienced to date.  Europe is on a precipice.  We must do nothing to push it over the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The controls in this treaty are already in European law.  We are accepting no new budget targets and no new austerity.  We are giving the existing targets more credibility.  We are saying we accept that states cannot spend and borrow without limit.  Under every conceivable scenario, a "Yes" vote will give us the most secure and cheapest access to the funding we need to keep paying public services and pensions.  By contrast, the "No" side is offering nothing but cynical arguments that are designed to exploit problems rather than solve them.  When they are asked how Ireland will find the €18 billion it will need in two years' time to fund services and refinance debt, all they can come up with is "sure someone will have to lend to us and we hope they will give us a good rate".  The "No" alliance, which extends from the extreme left to British and English nationalists, has nothing to offer other than empty slogans.  A win for the "No" side would represent an immediate worsening of the crisis and much deeper austerity than anything which is planned or likely.  People are seeing through the claim that they are being frightened into voting "Yes".  It takes some brass neck for those who have put up tens of thousands of posters claiming the treaty means ruin and desolation for Ireland to accuse their opponents of being negative.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_502">I have met thousands of people all over the country over the last month while I have been canvassing in advance of the referendum on this treaty.  They are approaching this vote with a deep seriousness.  I have found they understand the core positive case for a "Yes" vote.  If Ireland is to recover, we need to restore confidence in Europe.  We need to save the euro and stay within it.  Most importantly, we need secure and affordable funding.  If we vote "Yes" next week, we will have shown that Ireland is playing its part and that a basic step to restore confidence has public legitimacy.  We need equally decisive action from Europe's leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The European Stability Mechanism is not a long-term solution in relation to sovereign debt.  It is an important and essential step, but it needs to be bigger.  It does not address the fact that the eurozone needs a fund which can purchase Government bonds when they are issued.  The European Central Bank's purchases on the secondary market provided some breathing space at first, but then accelerated the crisis by enabling investors to leave the market.  The provision of funds to banks in the hope that they would buy sovereign debt also gave short-term relief which has created a longer-term problem.  The exposure of the financial system has been increased without a sustainable reduction in yields.  There are only two actions which can allow countries like Ireland to borrow at affordable rates.  First, the mandate of the European Central Bank could be changed to allow it to purchase bonds directly.  Second, jointly guaranteed eurobonds could be introduced.  Germany and some other countries have resisted these measures consistently.  Most leaders, including the Taoiseach, have refused to push the issue.  The time for being timid is long over.  It needs to be put to Germany in particular that it had a chance to provide an alternative route and failed to do so.  Its way alone does not and cannot work.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">It is clear that the eurozone is experiencing a low-key but relentless run on its banks.  Investor financing has dried up.  The system is being held together by the European Central Bank.  This is choking businesses and families that cannot access credit.  There is a need in most of Europe for permanent recapitalisation, which can only come from a co-ordinated fund operating at European level.  Leaders need to take immediate measures to make this happen.  The situation is even more serious in Ireland.  This has implications for investment, for the debts of the State and for hundreds of thousands of families.  The financial crisis here emerged before there were any European policies to help.  The primary goal of the measures adopted in Ireland was to help the eurozone as a whole.  It is not acceptable that Ireland is obliged to maintain these debts in full.  Any new European action on banks must include a write-down of these debts or place them on new terms which remove most of their impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">As we heard yesterday from the Central Bank, the actions of the Government and the banks on mortgage arrears are too little and are allowing thousands more people to get deeper in trouble.  Quite apart from the huge social impact, the economy is getting squeezed in two directions.  The banks are scared about potential default and are hoarding reserves.  Hundreds of thousands of people are withdrawing from the economy, in effect, as they focus on their mortgage debt.  This situation cannot go on.  We need European help to remove debt from the balance sheets of the banks and fund a major programme to restructure mortgage debt.  Nothing else will work.  A return to growth and job creation also requires increased investment.  The election of President Hollande is to be welcomed.  It has concentrated minds and led to a new willingness to discuss investment for growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Unfortunately, the specific measures being discussed tonight will do nothing other than confirm that the leaders do not appreciate the scale of the challenge.  People expect to be led out of this crisis.  They want leadership.  The use of the European Investment Bank to fund major projects is obviously needed.  It will have no impact if it is on the scale or terms being discussed.  It is reported that a pilot project bonds scheme is being discussed.  This will involve €230 million over the next year and a half.  Given that the eurozone economy is €9.2 trillion, the idea that these project bonds will stimulate anything is risible.  It would be worse than a token gesture.  I hope that speculation is not well founded and that something far more substantive emerges from the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Just as significant is the point that what is needed is not just more loans, but the transfer of funding.  The states that are most in need of investment cannot take on more debt.  They need direct assistance.  If the scheme goes ahead as planned, stronger regions will be the only ones which will be able to secure the funding.  At a minimum, existing EU funding should be redirected to areas which have seen the biggest increase in unemployment, with a loosening of co-financing regulations.  Over the last year, the leaders of Europe have repeatedly failed to show the ambition and resolve required to tackle a unique crisis.  They have consistently tried to work with pre-crisis instruments, only to adopt new ones when every other option has run out.  The situation could not be more grave.  It is clear that the euro will not remain fully intact.  New bailouts are becoming likely.  The final agreement that was reached in December has failed and a new agreement is required.  There must be an end to the timid and reserved approach of Europe's leaders.  The Taoiseach and others must stop being passive bystanders and speak up for radical action.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">Everybody is for growth now.  It is wonderful that everybody has been converted to the jobs and growth agenda.  The Nobel Prize-winning economist, Professor Paul Krugman, did not need to write all those articles and get so upset after all.  We were slowly realising that Professor Krugman and all the other economists who were looking at the situation, including Professor Stiglitz and Dr. Roubini, actually had a point.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">When it was announced that a referendum campaign would be necessary, the choice to be made by the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Martin, was an obvious one.  He could not campaign against this treaty or against failed right-wing austerity policies being enshrined in our Constitution.  When he was a Cabinet Minister, his Government was the architect of these policies in Ireland, which led to our failure to deal with the banking crisis.  If Deputy Martin had campaigned against austerity during a television debate with the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, he would have been laughed out of the studio.  Everybody at home would have been laughing as well.  He made a pragmatic choice, in the interests of his own party, to align himself with the Government during this campaign.  He should not accuse anybody of putting party before the State, or "the country" as he referred to it.  It is all a bit of a nonsense, is it not?</p>
          <p eId="para_512">In terms of the issue of growth, we in Sinn Féin have clearly said that these policies of austerity are failing in Ireland and across Europe.  We just cannot cut our way out of a recession.  When the Taoiseach returns home to Mayo, no doubt he talks to small businesses on the ground and no doubt they are telling him that if money is sucked from low to middle income workers and resources are taken from the people who sustain the domestic economy, then small businesses and the domestic economy will be strangled.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">It was an insane policy to pursue but, unfortunately, it was pursued.  Not only was it pursued but we sought to put in place a treaty and give constitutional protection to these policies so we would tie the hands of future Governments.  Thankfully, somebody has said that the emperor has no clothes, and that somebody now, most important, is the President of France, Mr. Francois Hollande.  During his campaign he stated that, if elected, he would not ratify this treaty as it is and he would seek to develop a growth strategy.  When we raised this point, we were shouted down by the Government.  Now, thankfully and helpfully, the French Minister, Mr. Pierre Moscovici, has repeated that point and made it clear that they will not ratify this treaty as it is and that there has to be a renegotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I have to ask the question why our Government is so enthusiastically supporting yesterday's European Union.  Why have we supported this treaty?  Why have we not called for a renegotiation of this treaty?  I certainly have not heard that yet.  Why have we not called for changes to the text to promote growth?  Why is that the Irish people have to rely on a French President to do the work for us and to act in our interests?  Why is it that our Government, in which our people put so much hope, has not done that?</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Now that there is a serious renegotiation of the treaty between France and Germany, we need to know the following.  Is the Government involved in those negotiations?  Are we now, as we speak, defending Ireland's interests or are we leaving it to the larger states once again to speak for us?  Is the Government promoting eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and a bank lending licence for the European financial stability facility?  If so, what are the details of the proposals being supported by the Government?  Is the Government promoting or supporting an increase in the investment capacity of the European Investment Bank and, if so, to what level?  Is the Government supporting changing the investment rules of the European Investment Bank and, in particular, the 50:50 ratio, which Sinn Féin had said it would like to see at 75:25?  Can the House imagine what we could do with our National Pensions Reserve Fund allied to those funds in terms of driving forward our economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_516">It is very important the Government outlines what is its strategy.  An article by Mr. Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i> refers to a lawyer going to a citizen and saying: “Here is a contract, here are all the penalties, here is what can happen to you in the contract and here is what is going to happen to you if you do not sign this contract.”  When the citizen says: “Hold on a minute.  Can you just tell me the full details of the contract?”, the lawyer replies: “Away with you, that is none of your business.  Sign this contract or this is what will happen to you.”  Can anyone imagine what the citizen would do?  That is what is happening to our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">To me, "Yes" is a positive and is something we should embrace.  Yet, I have heard no positivity coming from Government in regard to this because Government members know that what would remain if they left out the threats and had to debate the merits of yesterday's European Union - of a treaty that represents a political ideology that is now being taken out across Europe.  If we look at France, President Hollande has won, and in Germany, the Social Democrats, who have said they will not work with this, had a very significant success in the most recent regional elections, particularly in Rhine-Westphalia.  If we look at local elections in Italy and Britain, it is clear that parties which oppose this approach of "austerity only" have been successful.  The tide has turned, the game has changed, yet the Taoiseach is still presenting the old game.  If he is not, could he outline to us at some opportunity, hopefully in debate with Deputy Gerry Adams on some television show in the not too distant future, what is his strategy for growth and what is the other part?  The Taoiseach keeps saying this treaty is only part of the picture.  What is the other part of the picture?  Before he asks our people to enshrine in our Constitution - our precious and robust Constitution - protection for these policies, could we see the full picture?  We would like to know where the Taoiseach is at with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Before I pass over to my deputy leader, I wish to address the issue of sovereignty.  Would it not be nice to have a bit of truth?  The Taoiseach famously said he wanted to be the Taoiseach who returns economic sovereignty to the Irish people - that was one of his big calls.</p>

Why would he prevent the Irish people from having their democratic right to elect future Governments on the merits or demerits of their arguments?  Why would he put us in a position where, if we vote "Yes" and put this into our Constitution, and a future Government seeks to undo that, it will be in breach of Article 3.2 and we would have a situation where the European Court of Justice would come after us for breaking a solemn agreement with all of the other member states?  Why would he give away our sovereign powers in such a way that we cannot undo it?  Could he be truthful about that in this campaign, which would be very important?</p>

          <p eId="para_521">The Taoiseach is pretty upfront in his remarks and he states categorically that the intention of this meeting is not to take decisions or draw conclusions - that is in the fifth paragraph of the script he delivered to us.  If anything characterises the manner in which the European institutions have failed to deal with the crisis in which we find ourselves, that pretty much sums it up.  The Taoiseach is here briefing us before heading off to a meeting at which he believes decisions will not be taken nor conclusions drawn.  That is extremely telling.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">What it says is that far from a new urgency, at least in the mind of the Taoiseach and the mind of the system here, it is still this <i>laissez-faire</i>, business as usual approach.  The Taoiseach and his Government are half asleep on these matters.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, who is seated beside the Taoiseach, conceded or indicated today that we are looking a second bailout directly in the eye, it was the most comprehensive and explicit recognition of the abject failure of the Taoiseach’s policies.  Those on that side of the House know as well as we on this side that the policies of austerity have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">There is a reason that Mr. Francois Hollande and, more to the point, the French people are holding back in respect of this austerity treaty.  The reason for that is not a fit of pique, I believe, but a recognition that the current policy options are failing.  When policies fail, smart, responsible, responsive government has the capacity to change.  However, in everything the Taoiseach has said in this House - I cannot comment beyond that because, as was said, the Taoiseach is a reluctant debater on these matters outside of the Oireachtas-----</p>

          <p eId="para_528">The debate moves on, the politics shifts and the categoric evidence of the failure of austerity is there for all to see but the Irish system and the Taoiseach simply do not want to see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The Taoiseach quoted the OECD earlier during Questions to the Taoiseach and tried to put a positive gloss on its position, so let us see what it makes of matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The OECD states the eurozone crisis remains the single biggest downside facing global outlook.  No surprise there.  We would all agree with that.  It also states that the risk is increasing of a vicious cycle involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness, the debt overhang; weak banking systems; excessive fiscal consolidation, read austerity and cutbacks for that - all things for which the Government is a cheerleader; and lower growth.  That is its description of the vicious cycle it sees us in, and I agree.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">In his speech, the Taoiseach painted a picture of what he calls a "virtuous cycle".  The virtuous cycle brings the deficit under control and provides a growth stimulus to the economy which would boost growth rates and job creation.  This growth in turn would lighten our debt burden, which in turn would encourage further growth.  This is very sensible but the difficulty is that the policies the Taoiseach recommends, which are reiterated in the austerity treaty, are not the stuff of the virtuous cycle but the stuff identified as a vicious cycle of a downward spiral described by the OECD.  The Taoiseach may pretend forever and a day that it is not so but the reality contradicts that.  As long as we have 14% of our workforce on the live register, 30% youth unemployment, forced emigration on a scale not seen since the 1980s - with nine people an hour fleeing this State - and families under pressure in mortgage distress, these give the lie to the Government's propaganda that austerity is working.  It is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Let me be clear.  There is little point in the Taoiseach saying he is going to this meeting to do the divil and all and to be an active participant in a discussion around growth and jobs when he persists with an austerity policy that is killing any prospect of growth, keeping people out of work and sending yet another generation to make their lives and contributions in Brisbane, Toronto, Sydney and London.  I am relieved to hear the Taoiseach say that he will be an active contributor to this meeting because for a long time I wondered if he was saying anything at all at these meetings.  He says he has long been a champion of growth.  However, as a keen observer of these matters, it strikes me it has been the French electorate and Mr. Hollande who have forced this matter.  That demand for growth is reiterated across Greece, Italy and in Britain, where people have given their verdict on policies of austerity through the ballot box.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The call for citizens to reject the austerity treaty is a call to move this State and Government on to the right side of the conversation and debate at European level.  Austerity has failed.  There is nothing to suggest that come 1 June, things will miraculously change and austerity will start to work.  That will not happen.  Sensible people, politicians and commentators recognise that.  It is time for the Taoiseach to get a bit of sense, to get with the programme and to go to this meeting and, if he is going to be a constructive contributor, ditch his mantra of austerity and embrace a philosophy of growth.  However, that means ditching the austerity treaty too.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">The Government has peddled the line over the past number of weeks that it cares about the ordinary citizens of this country and of Europe and that a "Yes" vote on the treaty is vital to secure the interest of ordinary citizens and to secure access to the European Stability Mechanism, which has been presented by the Government as some sort of salvation for this country.  It has also pointed to Greece as a warning of the danger if the people of Ireland have the temerity to say that they have had enough of austerity, with the implication that disaster would be inflicted on them if they say "No".</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The past week has exposed the Government's bogus claims and possibly has exposed the fact that the Government has been involved in a dishonest deception of the people with regard to its real stance on these matters.  First we had the outrageous comments of the Taoiseach to a man who had worked for 30 years and was unemployed.  He made the disgraceful comment that the man looked like a person who could do with a day's work.  Then we had the outrageous comments from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, making jokes about the suffering of the Greek people and referring to Feta cheese.  One might consider these small aberrations, until one discovers in a report in <i>Der Spiegel </i> that the same Minister berated the Greek Government at the ECOFIN meeting for not imposing further austerity with sufficient vigour on the Greek people.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">One begins to wonder, therefore, whether the real position of the Government is complete disregard and contempt for the people who have been the victims of the recession, lost their jobs and been the victims of austerity, whether in this country or in Greece.  One wonders whether the reason it is trying to ram this fiscal treaty through is because it, like Chancellor Angela Merkel, is ideologically committed to the failed and discredited policy of austerity.  One must wonder, when all the political forces in Europe, Greece, France and even the United States now insist that there be a change of course and that Europe begin to prioritise jobs and growth instead of the failed policy of austerity, why only Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Irish Government cling to the failed policy of austerity and continue to want to ram through this austerity treaty.  Is it because Fine Gael is in the same European party as Angela Merkel, the European People's Party, that this is its real commitment?  Its real commitment is an ideological allegiance to Angela Merkel and her disastrous policy of austerity, regardless of the consequences for the people of this country or of Greece.  It is increasingly apparent this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">This week has also exposed the bogus threat that Ireland would be cut loose from funding if we voted "No".  When push came to shove and the Greek people finally found a political voice for their resistance that was willing to say "No, enough is enough" and that they would not wear any more austerity, the ECB and other voices in Europe suddenly started to say that they could not afford to let Greece go and wanted it to stay in the eurozone, because they know their involvement in Greece had nothing to do with protecting the interests of the Greek people and had everything to do with protecting the eurozone, the European financial system and their own self interests.  This proves that if Greece has leverage and Europe is not willing to turf Greece out because of the danger of contagion, Ireland also has leverage.  Ireland has the leverage to say "No", that it has had enough of austerity and that it is not working.  It has the leverage to say it wants a fairer deal for the country.  There is no question of us being thrown out of the Union or the eurozone or of having funding cut off.  If Europe will not do it to Greece, how on earth will it do it to Ireland without contagion spreading throughout Europe and bringing down the whole European project?</p>
          <p eId="para_541">It is about time the Government got a bit of backbone and stood with the forces in Europe who are resisting austerity and demanding that jobs, fairness and growth come first, instead of simply protecting the interests of bankers, bondholders and speculators.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">We all now know that despite all the talk of the past period about growth, there will be no agreement on a growth package from tomorrow's summit.  This tallies with the hypocrisy of the Government in claiming that it has been leading the charge to deliver growth in Europe.  That would be a laughable claim if the consequences were not so serious.  The reality is that we have heard platitudes but no details from any of the main economic powers on how growth can be delivered.  Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i>  published claims that productivity and growth could be achieved through structural reform and investment in education and modern infrastructure, support for small businesses and public-private partnerships.  It was the same old waffle about job creation and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The structural reforms proposed for Europe are purely based on liberalisation of the EU's Internal Market and deregulation of labour markets.  If we had any doubts about that, we need only read the comments by Mario Draghi in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.  When Mr. Draghi was asked about the most important structural reforms that could help us grow out of the crisis, he drew attention to what he called labour market reforms and the unfairness of the labour market.  One might believe he was making a positive contribution until one reads that he decried the security offered to workers who are long established in their jobs and wanted to extend the flexibility many young people in Europe experience by extending three month and six month contracts onto the shoulders of older workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">What we are seeing throughout Europe is a race to the bottom but job creation does not go hand in hand with measures aimed at driving down demand.  Job creation measures will have a marginal impact in the context of the overall reduction in demand required to fulfil the balanced budget strategy on which this treaty is built.  The argument that we will require billions of euro in additional cuts to meet those targets has not been answered.  The situation will only be made worse by the conditionality on debt reduction.  The facts prove that austerity is not working, even in terms of cutting the deficit.  The deficit increased from €12.7 billion in 2008 to €18.7 billion this year because of these policies.  Stiglitz, Krugman and other economists argue that an economy can never grow on the basis of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">When the first bailout was delivered we were told austerity policies would lead to a growth rate of 3.2% this year.  The dogs on the street know we are in a recession and this is the sixth successive year in which domestic demand has fallen.  How can implementing and extending those policies of austerity improve the situation?  The Government can say all it likes about growth but as long as it is implementing austerity the two cannot go hand in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I ask the Government to put the issue of bank debt on the table at the European Council meeting.  It should announce that we are not prepared to accept the impoverishment of our people or the destruction of public services to pay bank debts.  Why not follow Syriza's call and refuse to pay interest on the loan?  That money can instead be invested in job creation.  The ECB has no problem with loaning more than €1 trillion to banks at interest of 1%.  Why not demand that the money be loaned instead to Governments in order to fuel job creation?  That is the only way we can revive real growth and deliver jobs and a recovery of the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">There is little doubt that the majority of people will go to the polls on 31 May without really know what they are voting on due to the disingenuous nature the debate thus far.  The Government tells us it is important to vote "Yes" in order to get the money.  We have already received confirmation from Europe that any country in a programme will get money if it needs it.  If Europe did not give us money to help us stand on our own feet, it would be like cutting of one's nose to spite one's face.  The question would also arise of how we could repay the bank debt if it did not continue to give us loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">We are told the treaty is about housekeeping.  That is an abuse of the word "housekeeping".  Where is the evidence the treaty will bring confidence, stability or a recovery?  For the last three years we were told austerity would restore confidence because people would start spending and the private sector would create jobs.  We cut public spending and wished on a star that the private sector would start spending.  The confidence fairy does not exist, however.  No economist worth his or her salt believes it is possible to get growth from austerity.  It is the same as taking blood from a patient and expecting a full recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">It amazes me there is nothing positive in this treaty.  It makes the threat that we will be unable to access money.  That is not positive.  It proposes to introduce draconian rules on the citizens of this country.  We would tie our hands by making it more difficult for any Government to prepare budgets.  Furthermore, we face the prospect of fines if we do not keep to the rules.  The Government cannot claim that we will retain our financial independence when it is as obvious as black and white that we would be agreeing to having restrictive rules imposed on us by the EU.  Future Governments will also be hampered by an agreement we will have added to the Constitution and the Irish people will have less say in how their affairs are managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The most disappointing aspect of the fiscal treaty is its emphasis on controlling public debt.  Some people have argued that we would not be in our current mess if the treaty was in place several years ago but our problems did not arise because of public debt.  This crisis is the result of private debt which became public because of a poor decision.  The notion that the fiscal treaty would have averted the crisis is a complete lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The removal of power from governments is consistent with much of what has happened over the past 30 years since the advent of neoliberalism.  At the heart of neoliberalism is the belief that the State should keep its hands away from the affairs of business and the boats will rise for everybody if the markets and big business are allowed to take care of things.  We know at this stage this neoliberalism has not worked out as planned.  These theories have been seriously discredited since the crash began yet we being asked to include neoliberal ideas in our Constitution.  It is not remotely in our interest to do so.  The people have to understand that a "No" vote will force Europe to revisit this question.  It is time that Europe started to treat us with fairness once again.  It is completely unfair that the people are made to carry the burden for the problems created by the financial sector.  It is even more unfair that plans are afoot to make matters worse for ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">A "Yes" vote is a vote in the dark for uncertainty.  We do not have a clue where the Government will raise the money to meet its targets.  It is madness.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach  (Deputy Lucinda Creighton)</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I will try to stick to the topic at hand.  I welcome Deputies' contributions and, while I do not agree with the sentiment of many speakers, I appreciate their point of view.  Growth and stability are key foundations for our recovery, at home and in Europe.  The new treaty will help to build the stability Europe needs for the future.  The discussion tomorrow evening will help to inject real momentum into the drive for growth.  This is something the Government has been seeking for a long time and it is welcome.  Europe now has a real opportunity to move things forward, an opportunity that must be seized with both hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The impact of the crisis in Europe is acting as a drag on the global economy.  We have seen the concerns of our international partners, including at the weekend's meeting of the G8.  We must be ready to take the decisions needed to turn things around and have the courage to move decisively and swiftly.  Tomorrow, we must send a strong signal that Europe is determined to turn things around.  We need to show that we have the capacity to match our commitments with action and to think boldly and innovatively about what needs to be done.  President Van Rompuy has rightly said that there should be no taboos.  I hope the informal format of the meeting will help to achieve that level of free-flowing engagement.  Leaders will not be endeavouring to agree conclusions or take firm decisions, which creates the much-needed space for an actual exchange of ideas and views.  For this, I warmly commend the approach of European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">President Van Rompuy has identified a number of key elements, or building blocks, for discussion.  As the Taoiseach has highlighted, these include sound national economic policies, EU policies bringing added value, measures to improve the financing of the economy, and measures to strengthen job creation.  The first will allow us to take stock of implementation of the structural reforms agreed in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy and the European semester process.  President Barroso will brief the meeting with a preliminary assessment of the national reform programmes and will give a preview of the package of proposals to be adopted by the Commission on 30 May, particularly the set of country-specific recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">On action at EU level, the Single Market agenda will be a priority.  President Van Rompuy has identified a number of initiatives where high-level political commitments have not been followed through and he has pointed to delay on issues including patents and energy efficiency.  Both are of vital national importance to Ireland and have the potential to contribute to significant growth here if we can get agreement on implementation at European level.  President Van Rompuy has our full support in his efforts to remove any blockages and obstacles.  The time has come for people to think of the big picture and to live up to the commitments they have made.  We would go a long way to achieving the growth we desire if we could have the implementation at European level of commitments already agreed to.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The discussion on how to improve financing of economic growth will be of vital importance.  There are ideas with potential - such as increasing the capital of the European Investment Bank in order to support SMEs and the development of key infrastructure – but we must be sure that any new arrangements will be capable of delivering where they are most needed and where they can have greatest impact.  Similarly, the Government strongly supports the project bond initiative as having the capacity to leverage private funding for important infrastructural projects, but scale cannot become an obstacle to delivering investment and money to where it is most needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">We need to look at what remains within the framework of the Union's existing budget and consider how it can be deployed to best effect.  We need also to look to the budget currently being negotiated for 2014 onwards.  This must be directed, to the greatest extent possible, to growth and jobs.   This is a budget of over €1 trillion so it is not insignificant.  It is of vital importance to the agrifood sector in this country.  Some 85% of our funding under the new EU budget comes through the Common Agricultural Policy to the agrifood sector.  It is not to be sniffed at.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">President Van Rompuy has left the agenda for tomorrow's meeting open to innovative or even controversial ideas, as he puts it.  I hope people will take this in the spirit in which it is intended and will be prepared to engage in new thinking and to move beyond established positions.  It is a discussion that must happen if we are to build recovery and a sustainable economic future.  We need to tackle all the difficult issues, whether it is eurobonds or looking critically at the mandate of the ECB.  I am personally supportive of those two elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Not everything is for the immediate period ahead but Europe has to demonstrate the capacity to think strategically into the medium and long-term future, particularly if we are to restore credibility with international partners and with the markets.  Tomorrow's meeting of EU leaders will provide an excellent opportunity to reach the widest possible agreement on the decisions necessary to boost sustainable job creation and growth in Ireland and across the entire Union over the months and years ahead.  A fully fleshed-out and intelligent action plan for growth will complement the work we have done and are doing to end crisis and to restore stability, including through the new treaty.  Stability and growth are two sides of one coin.  It is a fallacy to believe we can have one without the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">On the basis that the Minister of State is offering me the courtesy of listening to what I have to say, I repeat that I hope the Minister will allay my fears, as one who represents a rural constituency, that this poorly-timed and ill-advised move will not take effect.  I represent a constituency with low participation rates in third level education.  It is a rural constituency with many farmers and farm families.  Should these reports be true and if the Government is considering such proposal it will ensure that many low-income families throughout Laois-Offaly will in effect be disbarred from entering third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">The grant system that has been in place for many years is very important to a rural constituency such as Laois-Offaly.  I have no difficulty with the income of parents being taken into account but not the farmland.  In many respects, the capital asset -  the agricultural land - is only material when the land is being sold.  The Minister of State is aware that we do not have a high level of land transfer, and when the land is not being sold the capital asset that is a family farm is never taken into consideration.  It is a volatile asset in any event and particularly in recessionary times when there is little market for such land.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">If the self-employed assessment is to change, will the shop and residence of a shopkeeper be taken into account?  I say "No".  In the case of a business operating out of an office, will the value of the office be taken into consideration?  I do not believe this to be fair or just in any circumstance.  Similarly, all farm land, farm buildings and farmhouses should not be taken into consideration in the assessment of students for a grant entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">There is a perception of discrimination against rural Ireland and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has an opportunity in his reply this evening to kill off that perception and to confirm that the current review group which will report shortly, and the Government, will not take into consideration farm land, the asset of the farm buildings and the farmhouse in the assessment for educational grant purposes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_569">I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important matter.  The Deputy refers to an announcement last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013-14 academic year.  A considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, on the grounds of equity and fairness.  The introduction of such a test would create a more equitable basis for means testing where a more complete analysis is undertaken of a family's capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.  The Deputy will appreciate, in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those who need them most and this has become a high priority.  While the introduction of a capital asset test for student grants may have traditionally been perceived as likely to impact in particular on farming communities, I assure the Deputy this is not the object of the proposal.  The means test will be applied fairly to all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">Deputy Flanagan may be aware that a dedicated capital asset test implementation group has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals for new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants beginning in the 2013-14 academic year.  The group has met on three occasions and its deliberations are ongoing.  I anticipate the group will report to the Minister by the summer and will make recommendations on the inclusion or exclusion of various classes of assets.  Any proposals will require further Government agreement and will necessitate legislative amendment.  It will, therefore, be agreed at Cabinet level.</p>

I ask the Minister of State to confirm who will have the final say, the group or the Minister?

            <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_576">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter, the need to combat homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools.  Last December, while calling on governments around the world to take steps to combat homophobic bullying, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, declared that homophobic bullying was a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health issue.  It is also a loss to the entire human family when promising lives are cut short.  The programme for Government commits the Government to encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and, in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying and to support students.  In May 2011, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, announced the establishment of a working group comprising all the relevant sections of his Department, along with the NGOs involved in this area and the education partners, to help draft a roadmap for the elimination of homophobic bullying from our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Homophobic bullying has been documented as one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in Irish schools.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual young people experience a much higher level of bullying than other young people.  Irish research shows that homophobic bullying is a significant cause of suicide, self-harm and other severe mental health difficulties among young people.  The statistics show that two out of five Irish teachers find homophobic bullying more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.  The anti-bullying research centre in Trinity College, Dublin, found that 16% of all Irish second level students were the targets of bullying.  The major study, Supporting LGBT Lives, funded by the HSE national office for suicide prevention, found that among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people the figures were even higher with 50% having experienced verbal homophobic bullying; 40% having been verbally threatened by fellow students; 25% having been physically threatened by their peers; and 34% having heard homophobic comments from their teachers.  Four out of five Irish teachers are aware of homophobic bullying in their schools and research also shows that only one in five LGBT young people in Ireland who are experiencing homophobic bullying seek support from their schools or teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">The impact on the mental health of young people is severe.  Research shows that 27% of LGBT people have self-harmed and 50% of LGBT people under 25 years have seriously thought of ending their lives.  A total of 20% of LGBT people under 25 have attempted suicide.  One in five has attempted suicide.  It is also known that most lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual young people know their identity at 12 years of age but do not tell anyone until they are 17 years of age.  This five-year period corresponds to the period in second level education.  As well as avoiding school and leaving education altogether, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual young people at this age are particularly vulnerable to self-harm and attempted suicide.  I await the Minister of State's response.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_579">I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the very serious issue of bullying.  Tackling the issue of bullying, and in particular homophobic bullying in schools, is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Bullying can ruin a young person's enjoyment of some of the most important years of his or her life and in some cases can have tragic consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">Deputy Neville summed it up when he spoke about the pervasive nature of this form of bullying.  It can act as a barrier to a young person having equal access to education.  I note that Deputy Neville referred to the document drafted by GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network.  I am to meet with that organisation's chair, Mr. Kieran Rose, shortly so that we can drive an agenda that speaks to the concerns raised by Deputy Neville.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Research has shown that, unfortunately, homophobic bullying is a problem in Irish schools, and a correlation has been found between homophobic bullying and serious mental health difficulties such as suicide.  That is one of the reasons the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, convened an anti-bullying forum recently, on 17 May, to explore ways to tackle the serious problem of bullying in schools.  That date, 17 May, marked the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">The forum, which was well attended and thought-provoking, considered issues around all forms of bullying including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.  There were a range of speakers at the forum, which included contributions from officials of the Department of Education and Skills, and from an acknowledged academic in the field of anti-bullying.  There were also contributors from the school sector, including the various perspectives of school principals, parents and pupils.  The objective was to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools.  A further objective was to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this, having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">The outcome of the discussions at the forum will provide an opportunity to set out a roadmap on how best to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.  A considerable amount of work to address the issue of bullying in schools has been done by State agencies and NGOs, such as GLEN and BeLonG To.  We need to address how we can deepen the impact of the measures that are already in place and also strengthen the culture of awareness in schools.  The work of the forum and any recommendations from it must be cognisant of the current difficult and challenging budgetary environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has also established a working group on tackling bullying.  The outcomes, recommendations and submissions from the forum will assist the working group in its deliberations.  The first phase to be addressed by the working group will be homophobic bullying.  There will be an opportunity for all interested stakeholders to submit their views in writing.  Students, teachers, parents and all other interested parties are invited to submit their views on this important topic by 29 June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">Deputy Neville has taken a strong lead on this issue.  If we continue to engage in fora such as this one, we will be able to shed more light on the issue, thus having the required beneficial outcomes.  We all believe that bullying is an issue we can address by sharing our experiences and working together to produce an effective response.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">I welcome the Minister of State's response.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has recently convened an anti-bullying forum.  Over a 15-year period, the Irish Association of Suicidology has identified bullying in schools as a serious issue concerning mental well-being, suicide, attempted suicide and self harm.   It is a real issue within the school system, so it is urgent to have more than guidelines within the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">There is a mixed reaction among schools.  Some schools are very good at identifying the problem and dealing with it while others are moderate.  Some are very bad in this respect.  I have met teachers who are interested in this matter but are very frustrated by the attitude of principals who may ask, "How many points will this approach obtain for the student?"  There is a lack of understanding in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">I also know that some school principals have attended the programmes run by the Irish Association of Suicidology and they do excellent work in promoting this area.  I will finish by quoting President Higgins who recently spoke about the appalling, destructive reality of homophobic bullying.  He said, "These are important issues, not merely emotional issues".  I would like to congratulate GLEN on the work it is doing, the information it is gathering and the research it is undertaking to raise the profile of this serious issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_589">I thank the Deputy for his input.  It is important to acknowledge the work that is already being done by the Department of Education and Skills to combat and prevent bullying.  The inspectorate provides help to schools by supporting, advising on and evaluating anti-bullying measures.  This is done through the primary and post-primary school evaluation process, and through the social, personal and health education subject inspections.  There are therefore a wide range of services in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">I note Deputy Neville's point about some schools being willing to engage in anti-bullying programmes while others are less so.  If there is a submission to that effect coming through this process, the Department of Education and Skills should take it on board in order to have a qualitative outcome to this issue.  Ultimately, the more educated we all are as citizens about this matter, the more it will be clarified and demystified.  The more normalised our culture becomes around this issue, the less pervasive it will be.  If we can change a culture we can then modify behaviour positively.  I note Deputy Neville's points and I hope there will be some mechanism to address the lack of engagement by some schools on this matter.</p>

          <heading>Local Authority Mortgage Arrears</heading>
          <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_367">
            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_591">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this issue.  We are all aware of reports this week that levels of mortgage arrears in the private sector have reached 10.5%.  Given that local authority house purchasing support is generally the lender of last resort, it is inevitable that it will suffer from a higher rate of arrears.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to address this situation and provide guidelines to local authorities which are struggling to cope with the problem.  The level of local authority house repossessions has greatly escalated in the past two years by comparison to previous years.  Based on the latest figures available in County Offaly, for example, up to the last quarter of 2010, some 106 homes were in arrears under the various affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership and tenant purchase.  The total value of those loans amounted to €1.7 million.  Councils must be equipped to facilitate people who are struggling to repay these mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">If local authorities repossess such houses they are still left with the problem of rehousing the individuals involved.  There are up to 100,000 people on existing social housing waiting lists across the country.  This will add further to the pressure placed on what are already very stretched resources.  These individuals will also be placed on rent supplement, thus further pressurising the State coffers.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">Possible solutions to alleviate the burden on local authority housing lists include interest-only repayments, deferred payments for a period or an extended loan repayment period.  The Department is committed to issuing guidance to local authorities for dealing with houses in arrears before the summer recess but no movement has occurred so far - at least, no movement that we are aware of, or led to believe may be forthcoming.  The updated guidance to local authorities is supposedly being drafted in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  We are led to believe that this will come before us prior to the summer recess.  Can the Minister of State confirm that this is the case?</p>
            <p eId="para_594">Will the Government develop a system that emphasises the rights of home owners?  Can the Government honour its commitment to produce new guidelines?  If so, when will that happen and what form will those guidelines take?  Can people be afforded some solace that local authorities will have guidelines which will have the rights of home owners as their focus?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_368" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_595">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  Local authorities have traditionally been the lenders of last resort for low income households who could not access funds from commercial lenders.  By definition, this cohort of borrowers is more susceptible to the economic downturn and external shock.  In this context, it is unsurprising then that local authority mortgage arrears should exceed those in the commercial sector and the Department's most recent information puts the level of loans in arrears at almost 28%.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">In 2009, the Department issued guidelines for the granting of local authority housing loans which applied stringent conditions and a more homogenous process across all 34 administrations.  Credit checking of applications by the Irish Credit Bureau was a central component of this initiative, and loans advanced under the new regime are performing considerably better than pre-2009 ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">However, it is important that households facing difficulties are treated fairly and consistently across all local authority areas.  In that regard, the Department issued comprehensive guidance in 2010 based on the regulator's code of practice.  This is to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Recognising the increasing difficulty with local authority mortgage arrears, the Department has been working in conjunction with the City and County Managers Association to produce a loans management manual, the publication of which is imminent.  This will provide borrowers in distress with a suite of options under a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, to deal with their loans.  It closely mirrors the Financial Regulator's revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which came into effect on 1 January 2011.  It provides for a collaborative engagement between borrower and lender to either restructure the loan to a sustainable level, or else recognise its sustainability and act accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">Whereas it would be hoped that as many home owners as possible could be facilitated under the MARP, it would be unrealistic not to accept the inevitability of a proportion of loans being deemed unsustainable.  In these circumstances the local authorities and the borrower would need to face the inevitability of the loan being unsustainable and act accordingly in a collaborative and co-operative manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">Local authorities will continue to deal with distressed borrowers with the same forbearance and sympathy they have exhibited in the past.  They will facilitate where at all possible as many home owners as possible to retain their properties and service their debts until such time as we return to less challenging times.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">I do not have a date in respect of the question the Deputy asked but respectfully suggest that if he were to table a parliamentary question or send me on note on it, I would be happy to try to oblige him.  We do not have a definitive timeline for the publication of the guidelines but I will endeavour to come back to the Deputy on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The Deputy referred to 106 homes in the case of County Offaly.  I am not sure if that is the rate of arrears, to what exact figure that would amount, or what it would be as a percentage of the loan book in the Offaly area.  If there are issues pertaining to his specific area, I have an open mind in terms of engagement or at least I can refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_603">On the Minister of State's last point, I merely used that example as a reference to indicate the levels that exist countrywide.  It is indicative of the position in a county similar to it, be it Tipperary or Laois, and of the position across the country for similar types of counties.  I used that example merely to show that in a county such as that, there is €1.7 million of a loan value that is greatly distressed and requires the attention of the new publication that the Minister of State mentioned.  If he cannot give me a timescale for it, can the Government not honour its commitment to bring this forward before the summer recess?</p>
            <p eId="para_604">Has the Money Advice and Budgeting Service been consulted and formed part of the consultancy process to bring about this publication?  The Deputies present were here last week when we discussed a Private Members' motion on the area of credit management and Deputies across the board complimented the work that MABS is doing.  They are at the coalface in dealing with this issue and they must form the basis of any publication which sets out an agenda and a ways and means by which local authorities will deal with this issue in the future.  What are the Department's plans for the shared ownership scheme in the future?</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_605">Having been a member of a local authority and as somebody who continues to interface with a local authority on behalf of my constituents, it is fair to reiterate that the level of sympathy and empathy with individual clients is one kind of a positive engagement where the local authority endeavours to do its very best for the client in question.  I believe we would all agree on that point.  However, there is an inevitability that a certain number of mortgages will go under.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">On the specific issues the Deputy raised, it is not fair to assume that because there is a lack of a timescale for the publication the Deputy would infer that it will not be before the summer recess.  I can come back to him on the specific matters raised and refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">I will undertake to also refer the Deputy's question on the shared ownership scheme to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I am not trying to dodge the issues, I simply do not have the specific replies to the Deputy's questions and I would rather not try to play a game of bluff.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</from>
            <p eId="para_608">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for providing time for the discussion of the recent HIQA report.  I wish to reflect on the fact that this report came about following the unfortunate death of Tom Walsh and I join others in conveying my sympathy to his family.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">This report is frank, straight and detailed in the 76 recommendations it presents.  It commenced as a report on one hospital, namely Tallaght hospital.  I have not finished reading it but, interestingly, it raises some important issues about all 33 public hospitals and puts a spotlight on some of the practices and systems that pertain to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">I note when the report deals initially with Tallaght hospital, it rightly refers to a history of long-standing challenges with regard to governance, management and funding.  Every detail of the statement is correct.  This begs a question about those supervising public hospitals over the past 12 years and says much about the shortcomings of previous Ministers with responsibility for health and about the HSE.  They are as complicit in what happened in Tallaght hospital and what is happening in other public hospitals as those involved in mismanaging hospitals, in this case with regard to governance.  This continued for 12 years in the case of Tallaght.  I must acknowledge after three months the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told the House he would deal with the issues of governance in Tallaght hospital and he did so.  I am not one given to flattering people, but I am stating a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">The practices that continued there should not have been allowed to continue but they were.  For 12 years the powers that be turned away from what was happening despite the fact that those working in the hospital, the very good staff in Tallaght hospital, were the first to recognise the difficulties and the bad practices in the hospital but got nowhere with those involved in its management and governance and this is regrettable.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">When it was first opened, Tallaght hospital was flagged as being the jewel in the crown of the health system.  This may have been the intention, but it should be noted the catchment area for Tallaght hospital has a very large population and population growth in the large urban areas in its surroundings such as Clondalkin, Lucan and Rathfarnham was not considered.  Therefore, from Tallaght hospital's early days we ended up with it becoming the busiest hospital in the country.  Not only was it the busiest but it was underfunded and for its first 12 years neither the HSE nor the previous Minister with responsibility for health did anything about the number of consultants working there.  People are mesmerised by the waiting lists and the number of people on trolleys in Tallaght hospital, but there had to be because it had one of the lowest ratios of consultants and operated with one of the largest population concentrations of any public hospital.  It could not have gone any other way.  It had a pretty unfair deal.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Minister for Health  (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_613">I thank Deputy Maloney for raising this important issue.  The recently published HIQA report on Tallaght hospital is a very significant document and I welcome its publication.  I am happy to confirm to the House it will be of tangible use as the Government continues to introduce major reforms in the health sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">Let us not forget what is at the heart of this, that 14 months ago in March of last year a man died in Tallaght hospital.  He was positioned on a corridor adjacent to the emergency department and perhaps the most significant single fact is that he was in a corridor where there was not clear clinical responsibility for his care.  He was effectively in a zone where no one had clear responsibility for his treatment and he died.  At the start of any discussion on this matter I want to express again my deepest sympathy to the family involved.  It should never have been allowed to happen and such a tragedy must not be allowed to happen again.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">As HIQA states in its report, the corridor was symptomatic of wider governance issues.  We should be grateful that HIQA has provided us with detailed analysis of all that flows from this fact.  As the Deputy knows, I moved to radically alter the governance of Tallaght hospital last year.  This document provides us with a blueprint for many more governance changes that will need to apply on a much wider scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">I remind Deputies that from the moment the Government came to power I made clear that the problems in our emergency departments would receive the highest priority from me, and in June last year we established the special delivery unit.  By September it was operational and much has already been done to tackle the many very complex issues that contribute the problems in emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">HIQA has recommended that the Department puts in place an oversight committee to implement its recommendations.  I intend to put this in place quickly and I will consider immediately how best it should be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Many changes have already been made in Tallaght hospital and the report acknowledges this.  The practice of leaving patients waiting for admission on trolleys in a corridor adjacent to the emergency department was clinically unsafe and completely unacceptable.  As I stated, this has been stopped.  The Chief Medical Officer has referred the report to the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais to ask them to address the significant issues that arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">I have also noted the report's findings into certain financial issues in the hospital.  I welcome the involvement of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General's into the matter but given the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I do not wish to comment further in light of this investigation</p>
            <p eId="para_620">Last November, the CEO of HIQA wrote to me with regard to her concerns about the deficits in governance and management at the hospital.  As a result a new interim board, chaired by Sir Keith Pearson, was appointed last December.  A new CEO is in place who is building a new management team, including clinical leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">Safe quality health care is a fundamental principle of the reform programme.  Last week, I approved the HIQA national standards for safer better health care to underpin the development of quality safe health care services.  The authority will shortly begin providing support to providers to implement the standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Long waits on trolleys are unacceptable.  The number of admitted patients waiting on trolleys in Tallaght and in 27 other hospitals continues to be proactively managed by the HSE with the support of the special delivery unit in the Department.  For the first quarter of this year, the cumulative number of patients waiting on trolleys throughout the entire system was approximately 20% lower than in the corresponding period in 2011.  This equates to almost 5,000 patients whose experience of our emergency departments was markedly improved through the work of the special delivery unit.  The equivalent result for Tallaght Hospital is an improvement of 63.2%, equating to 1,256 patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">There are still far too many people waiting for far too long and we continue to address this issue with the co-operation of the clinical programmes and front line staff.  I am seeking the greatest collaboration and personal commitment from all involved in the acute hospital system to protect patients and ensure the very best outcomes despite the challenging economic and financial circumstances we face.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonnMaloney" eId="spk_373">
            <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</from>
            <p eId="para_624">I share the Minister's views on the matter and recognise fully the changes he initiated in a very short space of time.  I repeat that it is regrettable that the citizens who live in the catchment area of Tallaght hospital had to wait 12 years for these reforms.  Tallaght hospital is a better place as a result of the report.  I have described it as the busiest hospital in the country.  It is fair to state that apart from being the busiest hospital, as a result of recent events it is also the safest public hospital in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">I pay due compliment to the very good staff of Tallaght hospital who provide the best possible care within the resources.  I wish the new CEO, Eilísh Hardiman, well.  She has brought about great changes in a very short period of time and this must be recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">I referred to the deficit of consultants at the hospital.  Will the Minister clarify what is the appropriate number of consultants for the hospital given its size?</p>
            <p eId="para_627">From previous discussions I know the Minister had intended to deal with the issue of the catchment area.  Is there a catchment area or is this hospital required to care or cater for such a large number of patients coming from outside its catchment area?  Will any changes be introduced so that the hospital can operate within the parameters for which it was built?</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_374" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_628">I concur with the Deputy that Tallaght hospital is a much better hospital than it was a year ago.  That is very much down to its new management and clinical leadership, and the new board that was put in place.  I pay tribute to Sir Keith Pearson, who has been chair of the interim board for a number of months, for which he received no remuneration and travels at his own expense on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.  He has offered much insight into how to turn the hospital around.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In response to the Deputy's question, the manpower would always be under review.  The catchment issue is one that has come into the news recently.  I assure the House that there is no legal basis for a catchment area <i>per se</i>.  Patients who historically attended a hospital like to go back to that hospital because their notes are there and they do not need to go over their history again or remember all the tests they might have passed.  That issue should not arise in the future.  From the point of view of a hospital on a fixed budget, this is a major problem.  However, as we move to a system based on the money following the patient, we should not hear complaints from hospitals about the patients who attend because they will be getting rewarded for each patient they see regardless of the part of the country from which they come.</p>

        <heading>Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage</heading>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_630">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I am pleased to bring the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011 before the House.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amalgamate the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, known as HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, known as FETAC, into a new agency entitled the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland.  The establishment of the new authority will fulfil a commitment in the programme for Government.  The new agency will also take on responsibility for the external quality assurance of universities, which is currently carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Before I detail the main reforms provided for in the Bill and the reason for their introduction, I will give a brief outline of the nature and functions of each of the agencies that are amalgamating.  I will also touch on some of the important work undertaken to date by these agencies, much of which has prepared the path for amalgamation.  NQAI, HETAC and FETAC were established in 2001 under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.  The core role of the NQAI is to establish and maintain a national framework of qualifications, which is a critical support for lifelong learning.  The National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, was launched in 2003 and comprises a system of ten levels incorporating awards made for all kinds of learning, wherever it is gained.  The framework encompasses the broad spectrum of awards made in Ireland by national awarding bodies, from basic literacy awards up to doctoral degrees and it also provides the basis for recognising international qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The NQAI promotes access, transfer and progression opportunities for learners across the education and training system, consistent with the overall aims of the framework.  It facilitates the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally as well as the recognition of international qualifications in Ireland.  The NQAI does this at a systematic level through European and broader international agreements, but also at an individual level through its qualifications recognition service.  It agrees and reviews the quality assurance arrangements of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  More recently, it took over responsibility for the Advisory Council for English Language Schools, ACELS, which inspects and quality-assures English language schools in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">FETAC and HETAC make awards to more than 200,000 learners annually in the further and non-university higher education and training sectors.  They also agree and review providers' quality assurance arrangements and validate their programmes of education and training.  They provide services for providers such as the VECs, FÁS, community training and education centres, Fáilte Ireland, Teagasc, the institutes of technology, and private further and higher education and training institutions.  FETAC and HETAC have developed standards for awards in a wide range of disciplines.  A large number of individual programmes of education and training offered by a broad spectrum of public and private providers have been validated and quality assured.  Through their systems of major, minor, supplemental and special purpose awards, the award councils and providers are at the forefront of efforts to provide flexible and responsive learning pathways.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, was established in 2003 by the seven universities to externally review their quality assurance activities and to support quality enhancement.  The IUQB has developed a detailed quality review process and has completed a full cycle of reviews.  A second cycle is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Before these agencies were established, there was little shared understanding of how the various awards in the State related to one another, and approaches to quality were uneven and unsystematic.  The relationship between university awards and those awarded elsewhere in higher education was sometimes unclear, while in further education and training, more than 50 awards bodies were operating.  The four agencies have made major progress in bringing coherence and consistency to Irish qualifications, in developing awards standards, in providing quality assurance to educational providers and programmes, and in facilitating progression opportunities for learners.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I will now outline the rationale for the amalgamation.  It is widely recognised that education has a major contribution to make towards our economic recovery.  A key challenge is to ensure that our education system caters for the needs of all learners, including those coming into further and higher education straight from school, those undertaking research in our universities, those looking to retrain and reskill following a period of unemployment and those seeking to supplement the skills they have developed in the workplace.  Deputies will be aware of the significant reform programme that is currently under way in the provision of higher and further education and training, in particular through the implementation of key recommendations of the Hunt report and through the establishment of SOLAS.  However, these reforms must be complemented by ensuring that we have fair and responsive ways of enabling learners to access and move between programmes and institutions, that learners can be assured of a quality experience in those institutions, and that the qualifications our learners receive enjoy wide recognition and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I wish to recognise the significant progress that has been made towards this end by each of the agencies being amalgamated.  The National Framework of Qualifications has become an integral component of the education landscape, and qualifications and quality assurance systems have been established in the various sectors.  The linkages from the framework to progression and access policies and onwards to awarding and quality assurance are now such that four separate bodies operating in this area is no longer the most appropriate organisational response.  I believe that further progress in this area can now be most efficiently and effectively achieved through the centralisation of functions into a single organisation that prioritises the needs of learners and that delivers a quality service to providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The amalgamation of the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC is a commitment in the programme for Government and forms part of the Government's broader public sector reform agenda that seeks to rationalise the number of State agencies.  The establishment of the authority has the potential to achieve efficiencies that will ultimately result in cost savings.  This builds on the efforts of the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC in recent years to reduce costs to reflect the current fiscal environment in which they operate.  To this end, these agencies have already delivered significant savings through implementation of the public sector moratorium on recruitment and through expenditure reduction across their range of activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The bodies' collective Exchequer outturn cost for current expenditure in 2011 of almost €7 million is 46.5% lower than the comparable outturn in 2008.  There is the potential to achieve further savings arising from the agency amalgamation through rationalised corporate structures and supports, integration of services and concentration of staff in a reduced number of locations.  Overall, the establishment of the amalgamated agency will strengthen the focus on the quality and standards in our qualifications and institutions, will bring a strong focus to creating flexible pathways for all learners and will deliver a more efficient and coherent service for providers that also has the potential to achieve savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I will now turn to the Bill and outline its key components.  The Bill sets out the overall structure of the amalgamated organisation and provides for its functions in the areas of: quality assurance of education and training providers; maintaining the National Framework of Qualifications; advising the Minister for Education and Skills on issues relating to quality assurance and enhancement in education and training; approving programmes of education and training; making awards to learners and delegating authority to institutions to make awards; procedures for learners to access programmes of education and training and to transfer and progress between programmes; developing a code of practice for institutions enrolling international learners and awarding an international education mark to qualifying institutions; and protecting learners in the event of the closure of an institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Bill repeals the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, under which the HETAC, FETAC and NQAI were established.  Provisions on board composition and corporate governance have been revised and updated from the 1999 Act and the functions of the existing agencies have been consolidated.  The statutory basis for the relationship of the new agency with various classes of provider and other stakeholders has been clarified and updated and the opportunity has been taken to address issues arising from the implementation of the 1999 legislation since its enactment.  New provisions on the regulation of providers offering education and training services to international students have been included.  The new amalgamated agency's official title will be the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland or QQAAI for short.  However, the Bill allows the Minister for Education and Skills to assign a different name to the authority for operational purposes, and one that is more easily pronounced.  This is similar to the arrangement where the National Tourism Development Authority is known as Fáilte Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">It should be noted that administrative preparations for amalgamation are advancing under the co-ordination of an interim board of the QQAAI, comprising the chairs of the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and IUQB.  Work is being overseen by the chief executive officer, CEO, designate of QQAAI, who was appointed in October 2010.  The CEO designate is now also CEO of all four existing bodies following the retirement on completion of contract or voluntary resignation of serving CEOs.  I pay tribute to the co-operation and collaboration which all the people involved provided during that process.  Progressing this work will enable the early establishment of the amalgamated agency following enactment of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Bill is set out in ten Parts containing 85 sections.  I will now give an overview of its main provisions.  Part 1 of the Bill is entitled "Preliminary and General" and covers the first six sections.  These sections include provisions on citation and commencement, on the making of regulations, on repeals and on expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill.  Section 2 defines the key terms used in the Bill and sets out the different categories of education and training providers to whom it applies.  A wide range of education and training providers are covered by the provisions of the Bill.  They include: existing universities and their linked providers, including colleges of education; any new universities, should any be established under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997 - there are none at present; Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which, like universities, have their own awarding powers; recognised colleges of the National University of Ireland; providers whose programmes are validated by the authority and lead to awards of the authority such as the VECs, FÁS and private providers; providers who have delegated authority to make awards - it should be noted that only institutes of technology have this authority at present; and providers who apply to be granted the International Education Mark for provision of education to international learners.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">It should be noted that the overall quality and awarding framework set out in this Bill has sufficient flexibility to be applied to any new structures that are emerging or that will be introduced in the future.  These include any structural changes that may arise as a result of separate legislation establishing SOLAS or in the event of recognition being granted to any technological universities in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Part 2 of the Bill is entitled "Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland" and covers sections 7 to 26.  Schedule 1 of the Bill is also associated with this Part.  Part 2 deals with the establishment and corporate structure of the amalgamated body, sets out the body's overall functions and provides for the funding of the authority from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The board of the authority will consist of eight members, including the CEO.  All members, with the exception of the CEO, will be directly appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Unlike its predecessor bodies, there is no provision for nominations from stakeholder organisations to the board of QQAAI.  Given the relationships QQAAI will have with organisations across the broad spectrum of education and training, I consider that the stakeholder nomination model would result, if it was to be truly representative, in a board that would be far too large to be fit for purpose.  Furthermore, the body will consult widely in the performance of its functions and does not require all stakeholders to be represented in its governance structures in order for different voices to be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Board members must have expertise in, and experience of, matters related to the functions of the authority.  At least one member will be representative of learners and I consider this to be particularly important in ensuring student participation in the quality assurance process.  It is my intention to invite the Union of Students of Ireland, USI, to consider nominating a person for that post.  This will also complement the measures in place within individual institutions for student involvement in internal quality assurance procedures.  At least one member of the board of the new authority will have international experience, and this is a recognition of the increased internationalisation of our education system in recent years.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Education and Skills may review the operation of the authority from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Part 3 of the Bill is entitled "Quality Assurance" and covers sections 27 to 42.  This Part sets out how providers must establish and implement quality assurance procedures to cover the provision of education and training and related services and have them approved by the authority, which will also periodically review their effectiveness.  The core provisions, although much more detailed, are similar to those in the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 and the Universities Act 1997.  There are, however, some significant changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">In the first instance, the provisions of the Bill extend to a greater number of providers than previously.  For the first time, there is provision for the establishment of quality assurance procedures by linked providers of universities, such as colleges of education, and by recognised colleges of the National University of Ireland.  The Bill also provides for the review of the quality assurance procedures established within linked providers by the relevant awarding authority.  The Bill also makes statutory provision for the external review of the effectiveness of the quality assurance procedures of universities.  This function was previously carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board but under delegated power from the universities themselves.  Acknowledging the greater autonomy that universities traditionally enjoy both here in Ireland and internationally, the authority will not have a specific approval role for the quality assurance procedures of universities.  However, universities must implement the authority's directions following a review by the authority of the effectiveness of their quality assurance procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">It is important to emphasise that the provisions of the Bill in this area will not encroach upon the academic autonomy of universities with regard to how they organise their programmes of education or research and how they quality assure those programmes.  The authority's role relating to quality assurance in previously established universities and providers generally will be simply to act as an external quality assurance agency, to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the universities' own internal quality assurance procedures.  This mirrors the review provisions currently set out in section 35 of the Universities Act 1997, with the authority replacing the governing authority of the university as the review body.  In this respect, the authority will continue the role of the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, with regard to external quality review.  This will ensure that a single agency has responsibility for external quality assurance across the further and higher education spectrum.  The Bill provides explicitly that the authority can withdraw its approval of the quality assurance arrangements of providers or linked providers and that in those circumstances, validation of all programmes automatically is withdrawn and awarding arrangements terminated.  In such instances, there will of course be an appeals mechanism and I will return to this issue shortly.  The Bill also empowers the authority to undertake quality reviews at cross-institutional level.  This could include reviews of a particular subject or award type or reviews of provision on a regional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Part 4 of the Bill is entitled "Standards and Awards" and covers sections 43 to 58.  This Part sets out the provisions regarding the National Framework of Qualifications and the making of awards by the authority.  It enables the authority to determine the standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by a learner before an award is made.  This Part of the Bill sets out the procedures whereby providers may apply to the authority to have a programme of education and training validated.  It also provides for the delegation of authority to make awards.  Awarding power currently is only delegated to institutes of technology but the Bill enables delegation to a wider set of providers subject to certain conditions being met and a review being undertaken.  The Bill provides that procedures for access, transfer and progression by learners must be developed by providers.  Such procedures are necessary to ensure that learners can access programmes and can move between them in flexible ways, while receiving recognition for their learning already achieved.  This will help to ensure the learners' needs are paramount in the system of awards and qualifications.  In a change from the provisions of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, public providers that do not have their own awarding power will be permitted to enter into award-making arrangements with an awarding body other than the authority.  This will give providers access to a wider and evolving range of awards and will provide for greater flexibility into the future.  The awards made must be recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications, which means they are quality-assured and that progression opportunities are understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Part 5 of the Bill is entitled "Code of Practice and International Educational Mark" and covers sections 59 to 62.  This Part sets out the arrangements for providers that provide programmes to international learners.  The authority will develop a code of practice for providing education to international learners.  Providers will be able to apply for an international education mark, based on their compliance with the code of practice.  The code of practice will be based on strong requirements in respect of academic quality and will cover such issues as the treatment of fees and support services for international students.  The code of practice and the international education mark are core elements in Ireland's international education strategy, Investing in Global Relationships.  They will be important supports in enhancing the international reputation of the education system by assuring international learners of a high-quality educational experience in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Part 6 of the Bill is entitled "Protection of Enrolled Learners" and covers sections 63 to 66.  This Part sets out the arrangements those providers offering programmes leading to awards of the authority must have in place for the protection of learners in the event of the provider ceasing to trade.  The arrangements must be put in place where a programme is of at least three months' duration and can be an agreement between the provider and two other providers to allow learners to transfer to a similar programme or, where this is not possible, arrangements for the refund of moneys paid.  These arrangements are unchanged from the provision of the 1999 Act but extend to a wider set of providers.  The arrangements do not apply to certain providers, generally publicly funded, including universities, institutes of technology, FÁS, Fáilte Ireland, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, VECs and recognised schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Part 7 is entitled "Appeals" and covers sections 67 to 69.  This Part provides for a process to be put in place to enable appeals against a range of decisions of the authority.  In line with best practice, appeals will be determined by an appeals panel under published procedures.  The appeals panel will be appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills and will consist of at least ten people with a special interest or expertise in, or knowledge of, education and training or the functions of the authority.  Part 8 is entitled "Dissolution of Bodies" and covers sections 70 to 76.  This Part provides for the dissolution of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.  Any reference to these bodies in a legal document will now be construed as a reference to the new authority.  Any claim or legal proceedings by or against a dissolved body will now lie with the authority.  All property, assets and records of each of the dissolved bodies will transfer to the authority.  Part 9 is entitled "Miscellaneous provisions" and covers sections 77 to 82.  This Part sets out miscellaneous provisions, such as the maintenance of a register of providers and a database, fees the authority may charge, provisions regarding institutes of technology and service of documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Part 10 is entitled "Transitional and Savings Provisions for Act of 1999 and Amendments of other Acts" and covers sections 83 to 85.  This Part, together with Schedule 3, provides for transitional and savings provisions for the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 and for amendments of other Acts.  This allows for the continuation of certain policies and criteria under the 1999 Act until such time as the authority adopts new procedures.  These provisions cover such matters as agreed quality assurance procedures, reviews, policies and criteria for validation of programme and applications for validation, awards by a dissolved body to be an award of the authority, policies and criteria standards for awards, policies and criteria for making of awards, delegation of authority and NQAI procedures for access, transfer and progression and charters.  There are three Schedules to the Bill.  Schedule 1 deals with the particulars of membership of the board of the authority and meetings of the authority.  Schedule 2 lists Acts repealed and statutory instruments revoked.  Section 35 of the Universities Act, which deals with quality assurance, is to be repealed together with the entire Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.  Schedule 3 lists amendments to other Acts.  There are 17 such amendments in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In conclusion, this Bill is an important step in maintaining and improving standards in education and training for all learners, including those who choose to come to Ireland from overseas.  It will build on the progress made in recent years by the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the IUQB.  The new authority will place learners' needs at the centre of Ireland's awards and qualifications system, while also providing a more coherent framework for providers that has the potential to create further efficiencies and cost savings.  I welcome sincerely the opportunity to debate the Bill in the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on all sides today.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_658">That is fine.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I welcome this legislation and assure the Minister the party will be constructive in its approach to this legislation in this House, as was my colleague, Senator Averil Power, in Seanad Éireann, where detailed debates took place on both Second and Committee Stages.  When in government, Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to amalgamate the various qualifications and quality assurance bodies and that was the correct decision.  This policy is being pursued by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I believe the new authority and new structures have the potential to be a highly positive development for the education sector.  The expertise and experiences that have been built up by the various bodies can be put to good use under the auspices of a single authority.  The new authority will benefit from the synergies to be gained from the proposed restructuring.  To my knowledge, there has been no credible criticism of the work of the bodies which are to be restructured.  As the Minister noted in his opening remarks, they developed and became more successful in recent years and have contributed to and enhanced the further and higher education systems.  The restructuring under consideration has been recommended in the efficiency review conducted by the Department of Education and Skills itself, in the OECD report, Towards an Integrated Public Service, as well as in the McCarthy report of 2009, which examined overall Government and public service structures and expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The new structures will enable the delivery of plans more effectively and more efficiently across the entire higher and further education sector.  It makes ample sense that the providers of the courses will only have a single body with which to deal and this should lead to efficiencies on the part both of the authority and the providers.  On numerous occasions, I have highlighted in this House, be it as a member of a party in government or in opposition, the need to minimise duplication and eliminate where possible overlapping of rules by different agencies.  Institutions should have to deal with the minimum number of bodies rather than a plethora of agencies with unnecessary administrative costs.  There is also the important aspect of ensuring that procedures are as much as possible simplified to make them more effective in terms of enabling progression across the system.  There has been good progress in this country in the area of progression through the education system.  As we all know, this progress must be continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The quality of our education is of huge importance from a social and economic point of view.  Continuous improvement is needed.  I believe that this legislation has the potential to assist considerably in this respect.  Quality assurance must be uppermost in our deliberations.  Quality assurance relates also to the student experience and ensuring they have the best possible experience of education.  The procedures in place for quality assurance should reflect this.  It is important that the voice of students and feedback from the student community is heard at all levels.  Student representatives have an important role to play in making a positive input where the quality of courses is being considered.  Over the years, some institutions have developed good procedures for involving students and quality assurance and view it as a positive which is how it should be viewed.  We must be clear that partnership with learners is the best way to improve.  It must be in every institution's interest to improve its systems.  We have all learned from the recent university rankings that the quality of the student experience is valued internationally.  It is a good decision to have a student representative on the authority.  I welcome the Minister's affirmation this evening that a USI representative will be appointed to the authority.  My colleague in Seanad Éireann, having been a student leader, would advocate that the Minister should appoint two student members to that eight member body.  However, I will leave it to the Minister to decide on the number of representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I understand that the authority's main role will be external quality assurance.  I believe the universities have good internal procedures.  The right balance between internal and external review needs to be achieved.  Supporting self-evaluation is important, as is empowering leadership in institutions at all levels, be it at course, department or faculty level.  Access, transfer and progression must be a key function of the work of the new authority.  The merger of existing agencies must assist in this regard.  As the Minister and I stated earlier, progression has improved.  The qualifications framework developed by previous Governments has helped this process.  The progress achieved to date needs to be built upon and to be given additional momentum.  It will be incumbent on the new authority to publish procedures in regard to progression pathways.  This will be extremely important and should be an early task for the authority.  Indeed, it should be a priority for it.  Clear paths to progression would help a huge number of students in the years to come.  This progression must be as accessible as possible to the maximum number of suitable students.  A successful progression system will enable us to provide greater access to third level for those students not in a position to gain entry through the traditional higher education route.  Obviously, the international reputation of our education system is important.  The authority will encourage education providers to provide for an international education mark based on their compliance with the code of conduct.  It goes without saying that standards and integrity are of the utmost importance in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">As I said earlier, this Bill will create a single agency, a new authority, which will enable consistency in quality and standards and the introduction of a more cost-effective service, removing any overlapping responsibilities.  However, the Minister has decided not to dissolve the National University of Ireland, NUI, as originally proposed by former Minister for Education and Science, Mr. Batt O'Keeffe.  Perhaps the Minister will in his closing Second Stage speech explain the reason for the exclusion of the NUI from the merger.  If he cannot do so on the conclusion of the Second Stage debate, we could debate the matter on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">This Bill will create a new body, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQAAI, which will consolidate services resulting in the dissolution of a number of bodies as outlined by the Minister.  I, too, pay tribute to the work of these bodies, many of which were established in relatively recent times.  Those bodies being dissolved include the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board, all of which have played an important role in the development of the further and higher education sector during the past decade and in some cases 15 to 20 years.  The establishment of the new Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland and the development of this legislation was first proposed when former Deputy Batt O'Keeffe was Minister for Education and Science.  As I said earlier, it had been intended that the NUI would be part of this new body.  There has been significant progress in bringing greater coherence to how qualifications in Ireland were awarded during the past ten years.  Prior to the enactment of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 which established HETAC, FETAC and NQAI, there were more than 50 awarding bodies, including FÁS, Fáilte Ireland and Teagasc.  It was appropriate that the number of bodies in this area was reduced substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The remit of the new Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland will be to maintain the national framework of qualifications and deepen its implementation; to promote the framework in Ireland and abroad and raise awareness of how qualifications are organised; to review the policies and criteria on which the national framework of qualifications is based; to publish procedures and access transfer and progression; to advise the Departments of Education and Skills and Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation on national policy and qualifications and learning outcomes across life long learning; and to oversee the implementation of national policy on the certification of learning outcomes across life long learning and advise the Departments of Education and Skills and Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation on national policy on the cumulation and transfer of credit and on the recognition of prior learning, which are wide-ranging and important responsibilities.  I welcome their consolidation in this new authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQAAI, will decide on the standards that must be met for an award to be given, and where standards are not met, on the removal of the validation of the programme concerned.  The Bill also makes statutory provision for the external review of the effectiveness of the quality assurance procedures of universities.  While the authority will not have a specific approval role for the quality assurance procedures of universities, the universities must implement the authority's directions following a review.  Furthermore, the Bill empowers - this is another important provision - the authority to undertake quality reviews at a cross-institutional level.  This can include reviews of a particular subject, award type or of provision on a regional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">In reference to his proposal to include the National University of Ireland, NUI, in this new structure, the former Minister for Education and Science, Mr. Batt O'Keeffe said in early 2010:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_668">Since the enactment of the Universities Act 1997, the National University of Ireland has not been a federal university in any real sense.  While the NUI supplies some shared services, all significant powers ordinarily associated with a university are directly assigned to the four constituent universities.  They make their own awards and have their own quality assurance procedures which are externally reviewed not by the NUI but by the Irish Universities Quality Board.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">Before we move to the Private Members' motion, I must deal with the Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Shane Ross, the Referendum (Amendment) (Varying Of Polling Day) Bill 2012 — First Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">On 17 May, Deputy Ross moved for leave to introduce this Bill but the motion was opposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  In accordance with Standing Order 124(4), the debate was adjourned until today, being the next day on which Private Members' business was to be taken.  The Order of the Dáil today provides that the time taken to dispose of this Bill will not be deducted from the time for the motion following, of Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The procedure for dealing with this Bill is set out in Standing Order 124(2), namely, to have a five-minute explanatory statement by the proposer and a five-minute explanatory statement by a Member who opposes the motion.  The question must then be put to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_674">The basis behind this Bill is not, as has been presented by many of its opponents, to force the Government to delay the treaty vote.  Its purpose is to amend the Referendum Act 1994 to allow the Government and, in particular, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to change the date in question.  It is a very simple operation to do that and this Bill could go through the House within hours, being a very short Bill with one purpose alone.  It could also go through the Seanad within hours and could allow the Government to have that facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">What amazes me is that the Government is refusing an enabling Bill.  We know that as of now, as a matter of policy, it has set its face against delaying the referendum.  What is astonishing is its refusal to take the powers to change the date, by ministerial order if that proves necessary.  Events are moving very fast in Europe at present and it may be both necessary and wise to change the date of the referendum.  I do not understand why the Government picked 31 May as the date for the referendum in the first place.  There was no necessity to pick this date.  There may have been a political imperative of which we are not aware but it would have been much more sensible if the Government, being aware of those events that were about to occur, were to have stated it would delay this particular referendum and, if it were not really a matter for delay, that it would pick a date when things had cleared up, when the French presidential and Assembly elections were over and the dust had settled on some very important arguments taking place about the ratification of the treaty.  These are still going on and have not even got off the ground at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Why did the Government pick 31 May?  Why did it lock itself into a situation like this, which became immutable when introduced and which did not take into account the French elections?  Let us look at some of the events Happening in the coming days.  Tomorrow night there will be an informal summit of European leaders, an emergency meeting, called specifically because of the change of government in France and because M. Hollande, the new President, has demanded either changes in the treaty or a parallel growth pact to be part of the same package.  However, the Taoiseach has stated there will probably be no definite results from this so-called getting-to-know-you meeting.  M. Hollande has to go back to Paris before 17 June and deliver some concrete changes or proposals that he can sell to the electorate, arising from the promises he made during the election.  That will happen.  He has definitely stated, as his Finance Minister stated last week and has not withdrawn, that he will not sign the treaty as is.  Yet we are going ahead with a referendum, riding into the danger that the treaty will be postponed or changed in the next month.  That is folly; it is foolish.  Even if it is not changed in text, it will be part of a package of changes which will include a possible growth pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">What surprises me so much about the attitude of the Minister and the Government is that if M. Hollande gets his way and gets a growth pact that would be good for Ireland.  It would make it better and more likely that the Government would get this treaty passed because it could sell it as part of what it has championed in recent months.  The resistance to this change is silly, pig-headed and stubborn.  It is also politically stupid.  The Government should think again about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Ratification has taken place in only three nations.  The Germans are holding back and so are the French and all the other nations of Europe.  Meanwhile, the euro is in turmoil, Europe is in turmoil and the situation in Greece, Spain and Italy is changing.  Yet we insist on going ahead with this folly when we could easily postpone it until the end of December.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">The Government opposes this Bill.  The Tánaiste announced the date for the referendum in this House on 27 March.  He also outlined the constitutional amendment to be put to the people.  Within days, the Government published the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution, (Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Whenever a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government makes the polling day order for that referendum.  I did so on 30 April 2012 and arrangements for holding the referendum were put in place for the 43 constituencies throughout the country.  The existing legislation in this area, the Referendum Act 1994, does not provide for the changing of a referendum polling date except in circumstances where the Dáil is dissolved.  Deputy Ross should have done a little more research on that legal matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">The Referendum Commission recently confirmed this, stating it was not only in the interest of ensuring public certainty about the polling date but also to ensure there is a robust public debate on the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I remind Deputy Ross that Article 46.2 of the Constitution provides that a constitutional amendment Bill passed by the Oireachtas has to be "submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the Referendum".  It is clear that the constitutional amendment Bill on the stability treaty must be submitted by referendum to the people, pursuant to that article.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">More generally, the Government does not consider a postponement of the referendum to be in the best interest of the country at this stage.  As the Tánaiste stated to the House last week, what the country needs now is certainty, not indecision.  The Deputy has gone to a lot of trouble in order to create indecision by seeking to have this particular matter postponed.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">The referendum is an opportunity for individual citizens to make a clear statement that we want stability and certainty.  Investors are looking at Ireland's response in order to see if we choose the stability that will enable them to invest with confidence in our economy.  That is how we will create jobs, allow the economy to recover and make a better future for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Deputy Ross advocates a postponement of the referendum in order to take on board changing events in Europe.  I am surprised that anybody should think it is for others outside Ireland to determine what our position should be.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_806">I am honoured to open this debate and formally move the Sinn Féin motion.  This is an historic motion as it is the first time the Oireachtas has held a full-scale debate on the national treasure that is Moore Street.  I welcome the families, friends and supporters of the heroic men and women of 1916, who are present with us here this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The GPO, Moore Street and the laneways between it and O'Connell Street form the most important battlefield site in modern Irish history.  This area must be fully protected, carefully preserved and sensitively developed as a cultural quarter.  That is why Sinn Féin has tabled this motion and has sought the support of all Deputies.  The motion calls for "the 1916 National Monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street [to be] fully protected and preserved in its entirety as designated and that the surrounding buildings, streets and laneways are retained in such a manner that the potential to develop this area into a 1916 historic-cultural quarter can be fulfilled".</p>
          <p eId="para_808">This is not about gaining or losing political points.  The fact is we all need to remind ourselves how much we owe those men and women who, almost a hundred years ago, defied a powerful empire and proclaimed the Irish Republic.  The motion calls on the Government to ensure an area which is steeped in Irish history is developed as an historic quarter and battlefield site in time for the centenary of the Rising.  I would urge all Deputies who have been elected by the citizens of Ireland to support this call from the relatives of the 1916 leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The condition of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is nothing short of disgraceful and is an insult to the memory of those men and women whom we should honour.  We owe it to the men and women of that period not to disregard their reputation and memory by destroying a building so closely associated with their struggle.  During a tour of the battlefield site in July 2010, the current Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore stated: "Our commemoration of 1916 should not just be a token flag waving commemoration, but it should be real, and I think there is an obligation on the State to respond positively to the relatives of the 1916 leaders to go with this project."  I would hope the Tánaiste's views on this issue have not changed since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The relatives of the 1916 leaders campaigned diligently for Nos. 14-17 Moore St. to be designated as a national monument.  In January 2007 they succeeded when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14-17 and the land and buildings to the rear under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930.  The order was made on the grounds that the buildings are of national importance by reason of their historic significance as the final headquarters of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I have no doubt that this historic terrace would have been demolished at the height of the Celtic tiger but for the vigilance and the campaigning of the relatives and their supporters in all walks of life in Ireland.  This historic terrace, which witnessed the fires of Easter 1916, has seen the Celtic tiger come and go and still survives, yet it is still under threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Time does not allow me to go into the complex planning history here.  Suffice to say, the proposed plan of the developer would effectively destroy the national monument, leaving only a mere facade which would be engulfed in a large scale edifice.  The development would also obliterate the streetscape and built fabric of one of the most historic areas of the city, both in terms of its association with the events of Easter 1916 and its architectural heritage.  The developer intends to invade and build on 60% of the area covered by the national monument order.  This would see the buildings gutted and excavated and the demolition of the terrace on either side of them.  When it was announced in 2006 that national monument status was to be granted, it was generally believed that after a widely supported campaign, the historic buildings would be fully preserved and converted into a centre honouring the men and women of 1916.  It came as a shock to many that the go-ahead was given for a development that will effectively destroy these buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The relatives here today are totally opposed to the planned development of Moore Street by developer Joe O'Reilly, who has been seen as a member of the golden circle and who is currently in NAMA.  It is important to point out that this developer has only conditional planning permission.  The grant of permission is conditional on a number of requirements.  Crucially, this includes the consent of the Minister for work to the national monument, the provision of a 1916 element, separate statutory consents and financial contributions to the city council.  It is evident that ministerial consent in this application is being sought solely for the purpose of facilitating the commercial interest of a NAMA developer.  Clearly, the Minister should refuse this consent.  He should not allow the national monument to be encroached on or interfered with in any way.  He and his colleagues in government should look to the importance of this site and its great potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Moore Street is of extreme importance, not just to the people of Dublin or the people of Ireland, but also internationally.  This area has huge educational importance for the people of Ireland.  This was the final headquarters of the republican forces during the final hours of the Easter Rising.  It was in this building that James Connolly lay wounded as the Provisional Government held its final meetings.  Also present were his fellow members of the Provisional Government - Padraic Pearse, Joseph Plunkett, Thomas Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada.  These five men were amongst the 16 executed leaders of the 1916 Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">As Deputies are aware the area of cultural tourism continues to hold huge economic potential.  This motion clearly calls on the Government to invest in cultural tourism.  The entire Moore Street area is rich in history and would act as a fantastic attraction for visitors from home and abroad.  An area of such significance both historically and educationally should be restored and protected, not only for the people of Ireland but for people all over the world.  The question all Deputies must ask is in what state this national monument will be come 2016.  Will it be neglected and under threat as it is today?  Will it be a shell, engulfed in a shopping mall or will it be preserved and cherished, forming a centre-piece for the centenary of the 1916 Rising and a major cultural asset for our capital city for decades to come?</p>
          <p eId="para_816">There are two options facing all Deputies here tonight.  Option one is to vote against this motion and vote in favour of the Government amendment and, possibly, allow the destruction of one of the most historic sites in Ireland.  In taking that option, we as elected representatives would be turning our backs on our history to favour a NAMA developer.  Option two is that we as a country acknowledge the huge sacrifice that those brave men and women made in 1916 and pay tribute to their cause and realise the educational and historical importance of Moore Street and the surrounding lanes.  It is that we, as elected representatives, make the right choice.  I urge all Deputies to honour and pay tribute to the men and women of 1916 and vote in favour of this motion as it stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_817">I welcome the relatives of the men and women of 1916 here tonight.  The fact that the buildings at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are under renewed threat due to deterioration, despite the 2007 preservation order, is a cause for concern.  For that reason, it is important that the broad support in this motion for both the building and the surrounding district to be preserved in a fitting manner is heeded.  I hope the Government accepts the motion in the spirit in which it is intended and does not oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The part of Dublin where the rising took place ought to have the same status as similarly important historical places in other cities.  It is somewhat of an indictment of this State's preservation of the memory of 1916 that there is no physical centre that can be visited in order to absorb some of the atmosphere of the time.  Of course, the GPO remains as it was then as the central post office and as a vibrant working centre and those in charge of the building do an excellent job in maintaining some physical connection with Easter 1916, through the paintings inside the building and a small exhibition area.  However, while that is commendable, I believe a dedicated centre needs to be built and that the buildings on Moore Street would fulfil that purpose, particularly as they are currently both unused and in disrepair.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">There is great potential in the idea of developing the area into an historical and cultural quarter that would not only help to preserve the historical memory of what took place there, but would also attract visitors interested in our history.  At present, much of that is left to private individuals who conduct walking tours.  While that is most commendable, and I am certain that the tours are both informative and popular, there ought to be solid physical evidence of what took place in those streets.  Perhaps Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street could be used to form the centre of that, with a heritage centre built up around them.  Such a centre and the creation of such an historical and cultural heritage area would not have to be exclusively devoted to what took place at Easter 1916.  That general area of Dublin has been of historical and cultural importance for centuries and the centre could become the focus for all of that.  The initial key for that however needs to be positive action to ensure the premises in Moore Street do not fall into further disrepair and that such disrepair is not used as an excuse to pull them down to make way for whatever those behind the latest planning application have in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">This brings us to the reason the buildings are under threat in the first instance.  It is perhaps ironic that the last headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising should have come under threat from the speculators who have ensured that much of the leaders' vision for the Republic declared in Dublin at Easter 1916 has not been fulfilled.  The Proclamation that was posted at the General Post Office on 24 April 1916, referred to the interests of the Irish people being paramount and to the right of the Irish people to the ownership of Ireland.  Unfortunately, what we have seen in this State, particularly over the past 30 years, has been a new usurpation of that right, not by a foreign occupier, but by a rapacious native class of parasites.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Much of the reason for the current crisis facing this State was not, as some would like people to believe, the exorbitant wages allegedly paid to nurses, teachers and fire fighters, but the criminal incompetence and greed of a small minority of financial and property speculators.  Of course they were not alone and, unfortunately, unlike the men and women inspired by the vision of the Republic, those parasites found only too willing accomplices among the so-called political elite in this State.  As the Mahon and Moriarty tribunal reports prove, significant sections of the political class, from local authority councillors right up to the Cabinet, were willing to collaborate with the speculators.  Some of the by-products of that were the lunatic ventures, land deals and speculative plans foisted on the people of Dublin and other parts of the country.  Indeed we have not yet been told the full extent of the corruption that went on outside of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The plan for Moore Street was one of those lunatic ventures, although it appears to have been halted temporarily by the collapse of the speculative bubble and its banking arm several years ago.  The original developers are currently under the auspices of NAMA.  However, this makes it even more important to act now to ensure the site is preserved and that the plans for a cultural and historical centre which I believe would have the support of the people and elected representatives of Dublin can proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The danger is that if by some chance the current planning application is approved and the current owners are then enabled to sell their currently encumbered property holdings the plan could be resurrected and the site damaged or even obliterated.  The only way to ensure that does not happen is if the Minister acts as called on in our motion and ensures the full preservation of the buildings as a national monument.  Once that occurs further steps can be taken to progress the longer term and broader idea of developing Moore Street and the surrounding area as an historical and cultural zone, with all the benefits I referred to earlier in terms of it becoming an historical and educational resource and a major tourism attraction.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Given that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is from the same county as me it would be remiss not to mention one of the heroes of 1916.  On Friday, 28 April, with the GPO on fire, the O'Rahilly volunteered to lead a small party of men in search of a route out of the GPO to Williams and Woods, a factory on what was then called Great Britain Street and is now Parnell Street.  A British machine gun at the intersection of Great Britain Street and Moore Street caught him and most of his party.  The O'Rahilly slumped into a doorway on Moore Street, wounded and bleeding badly, but soon made a dash across the road to find shelter in Sackville Lane, now O'Rahilly's Parade.  In his attempt to find shelter he again exposed himself to sustained fire from machine gunners.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">It is often mooted that 19 hours after receiving his wounds on Friday evening and long after the surrender took place on Saturday afternoon, the O'Rahilly still clung to life.  The specific time of his death is difficult to pin down but we can be more precise when it comes to understanding his final thoughts.  Despite his obvious pain, he took the time to write a message to his wife on the back of a letter he had received from his son.  In this last message to Nancy, which Shane Cullen has etched into a limestone and bronze sculpture, he wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_826">Written after I was shot.  Darling Nancy I was shot leading a rush up Moore Street and took refuge in a doorway.  While I was there I heard the men pointing out where I was and made a bolt for the laneway I am in now.  I got more [than] one bullet I think.  Tons and tons of love dearie to you and the boys and to Nell and Anna.  It was a good fight anyhow.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The Minister and I should be proud of our fellow Kerryman.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">He is a man I commemorate every year along with Eddie Carmody, who was also from Ballylongford.  It would be an awful indictment of the Minister and his Government if they failed in their responsibility to protect the great legacy of the men and women of 1916 and their courageous and determined efforts to bring about a real Republic that would do justice of all the people of Ireland, cherish the children of the nation equally and exploit our resources for the common good of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I draw the Minister's attention to a letter he received from the family of Major General Joe Sweeney, who was prominent in the events of Easter week.  He fought inside the GPO and was one of those who helped to carry James Connolly on a stretcher through the houses to a makeshift hospital on Moore Street.  As the Minister will be aware, the family has expressed disappointment at not being invited to the recent commemoration ceremony at Arbour Hill and I ask the Minister to ensure that the oversight is rectified in following years.  The family is very proud of its connection to the momentous events of the time.  I urge the Minister to do the right thing by the Irish people and support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_831">In his last letter before his execution in Kilmainham Jail on 8 May 1916, Eamonn Ceannt wrote, "In the years to come Ireland will honour those who risked all for her honour at Easter in 1916".  How do we honour those who risked and gave all in 1916?  We do so primarily by seeking to fulfil in our own time the promise of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, which asserts Irish sovereignty and seeks real equality.  As political parties and Independent Deputies with differing political outlooks we frequently disagree about how the promise of the Proclamation is being fulfilled but we should be at one in ensuring that our people and future generations have full access to the heritage of the Easter Rising of 1916 not only in the written word and the physical legacy of the buildings and the streets where our history was made but also in the realisation of the dream of those who wrote the Proclamation, our charter for freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Kilmainham Gaol stands today as one of the best preserved and most visited historical buildings in Europe.  If not for the dedication of a group of citizens this sacred place would have fallen into ruin and been erased from our capital city.  A group of volunteers, many of whom had fought for Irish freedom, banded together and through voluntary work and campaigning ensured that the prison was saved and turned into a museum.  Only then did the State step in.  There is an exact parallel with the national monument on Moore Street.  The dedication of the relatives of the 1916 leaders and those who supported them in their campaign over many years has ensured that 14-17 Moore Street has been saved thus far from the bulldozers.  Unfortunately, however, the last headquarters of the 1916 leaders has come far closer to demolition than their place of execution in Kilmainham.  It should not be necessary to stress the importance of this site.  The layout of the streets and lanes around the GPO, Moore Street and Parnell Street which witnessed the events of Easter 1916 remain largely as they were at the time, even though most of the buildings have been demolished in the intervening period.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Remarkably, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and the terrace of which they form a part remain intact, albeit only just.  They have survived the fires and bombardments of the Rising and the Civil War.  Ironically, they were under greater threat during the era of the so-called Celtic tiger.  What a disgrace it would be now, as we prepare to mark the centenary of the 1916 Rising, if these buildings were to be undermined, encroached on and engulfed in a shopping centre.  The motion before the Dail has the support of 50 Deputies.  I thank them for their support and urge all Deputies to put aside party differences and support this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The motion has two inextricably linked elements.  First, it resolves to ensure that the 1916 national monument at 14-17 Moore Street is fully protected and preserved in its entirety and as designated.  Second, it resolves that the surrounding buildings, streets and laneways are retained in such a manner that the potential to develop this area into a 1916 historic and cultural quarter can be fulfilled.  The motion is addressed to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.  It is up to the Minister and the Government to decide whether the developer can go ahead with his plan because any development affecting the national monument at 14-17 Moore St. requires the Minister's formal consent under the National Monument Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I regret to say that in responding to this motion, and in the amendment tabled in the name of the Minister, the Government has taken a narrow, minimalist approach which gives no real assurance that the national monument will be fully protected and preserved in its entirety and as designated.  Our justifiable fear is that the Minister and his Department are inclined to the false view that the developer's proposal would preserve the national monument.  In a letter of today's date the Minister's adviser states that the plan would retain what he describes as all structurally viable elements of the existing buildings.  The developer intends to build upon 60% of the site covered by the national monument.  The buildings as they stand will be gutted, there will be excavations beneath them and the terrace on either side will be demolished, all in the context of a giant shopping mall.  So much for the alleged plan of the developer to develop a commemorative centre at the national monument.  Clearly, the first element of the motion, the preservation in full of the national monument cannot be fulfilled if the Minister approves the developer's proposed work on and around the site.  Equally clearly, ministerial approval of the plan would be inconsistent with the second part of the motion, the retention of the surrounding buildings, streets and laneways in such a manner that the potential to develop an historic quarter can be fulfilled.  For these reasons, we cannot accept the Government amendment.  It represents a minimalist approach and a lousy position as we approach the centenary of the Easter Rising 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">It may be argued by some voices in Government that refusal to give the go-ahead to the developer risks the State being sued.  However, the Planning and Development Act 2000 states that any development that would materially affect a protected structure or proposed protected structure is a development in respect of which a refusal of permission will not attract compensation.  The same Act gives as a reason for the refusal of permission, which excludes compensation, "the proposed development would injure or interfere with a historic monument which stands registered in the Register of Historic Monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act".  The developer in question is insolvent and in NAMA, a State agency with a direct responsibility to the people of this State.  Does the Government seriously hold out the prospect of a busted developer on a NAMA life support machine suing the Minister for fully protecting a national monument?  I think it most unlikely.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The likelihood is that the current developer may never build the proposed shopping mall but, with full planning permission and ministerial consent to get his way with the national monument, he may - with the approval of NAMA - sell on the site to some other developer who would do so.  This would be the worst possible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The Minister and the Government need to get a grip.  They need to take control of the situation.  The planning saga has been going on since August 1999.  Through that time there has been a massive and unsightly void on the main street of our capital city.  One of our most important national monuments has been decaying and under threat and an historic quarter of Dublin, with massive potential to enhance our heritage, has been allowed to deteriorate as it languishes in a planning limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">larraim ar gach Teachta tacú leis an run seo.  larraim ar an Rialtas an leasú a aistharraingt.  An bhfuilimid chun a rá leis an bPiarsach: "Mo chlann féin do dhiol a máthair"?</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Government should withdraw its amendment.  It should support the substantive motion tabled by Sinn Féin, with the support of other political parties and Independent Members.  The Minister should refuse his consent.  He should enter dialogue with all stakeholders - the 1916 relatives, all property owners in the area and not just the developer, the local authority Dublin City Council, the National Museum and other relevant State agencies.  The aim should be to come up with a new plan to fully preserve the national monument and to develop the historic 1916 quarter in time for the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  Let us hope we all live to see that achievement and celebrate the tremendous legacy of the brave men and women who fought and asserted the right of the Irish people to their freedom and national rights but who also lit a beacon that many nations the world over have since emulated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_841">Looking at the history of the area, the Easter Rising was an insurrection staged in Ireland during Easter week 1916.  The Rising was mounted by Irish republicans with the aims of ending British rule in Ireland.  It was the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.  Organised by the military council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Rising lasted from Easter Monday, 24 April to 30 April 1916.  Members of the Irish Volunteers, led by schoolteacher and barrister Pádraig Pearse, were joined by the smaller Irish Citizen Army of James Connolly, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan.  This rising was where our forefathers fought for Irish freedom and an Irish Republic and willingly gave their lives in the name of their country.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">That is why we are in the Chamber as we approach the centenary of this most significant event in our relatively young history.  It is imperative that we support the motion, which resolves to ensure that the 1916 national monument at 14-17 Moore Street is fully protected and preserved in its entirety as designated and that the surrounding buildings streets and laneways are retained in such a manner that the potential to develop this area into a 1916 historic cultural quarter can be fulfilled.  The motion calls on the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to act without further delay to ensure the full preservation of the national monument and to develop a plan to transform the GPO and Moore Street area into an historic quarter and battlefield site to protect and preserve the 1916 national monument.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I compliment Sinn Féin on tabling this Private Members' motion and for seeking the inclusion of signatures from Members of other parties and those of none.  It is important that no individual or political party attempts to hijack this issue for political purposes.  Our national heritage is too important for party political games.  By all Members supporting this motion, Dáil Éireann can show the country it is serious about giving the Easter 1916 centenary the respect and commemoration it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">This issue has been ongoing for many years now and with every passing year this historic location is falling into further neglect.  Looking at the chronological sequence of events over the years, it is worrying that such an historic location did not receive the recognition it deserved.  Many questions remain unanswered in that regard but that is for another day.  We can not change what has happened but we can learn from previous mistakes.  We must move forward this project in a positive way without delay.  I was pleased to be present at the meeting of the Oireachtas committee when the Save 16 Moore Street campaigners made a presentation outlining the group's realistic proposals for this area.  I compliment the group on its longstanding dedication to the cause.  The Save 16 Moore Street group is seeking the protection of national monument status of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street against the encroachment of new property development.  The group is also calling on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to protect and preserve the 1916 Moore Street terrace and buildings, streets and laneways linked to the 1916 Rising and to facilitate a 1916 cultural and historical quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">In 2007, the  Fianna Fáil Government brought in a preservation order to protect these sites.  However, a much wider area needs to be considered.  There is a requirement to protect the buildings comprising Nos. 32 and 33 Henry Street.  An appeal by An Taisce has been lodged with An Bord Pleanála.  One wonders at some of these assessments when the architectural heritage assessment claims no records exist of any historic event associated with the buildings, despite the clear evidence that they were occupied by Volunteers during the 1916 Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">This country does not need another shopping centre.  We need to protect our culture and our heritage.  I ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to refrain from making any decision regarding the approval to build on the historic site of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, pending an independent battlefield assessment as recommended by the director of the National Museum of Ireland.  I encourage the Minister to engage with all relevant parties, with NAMA and the various interested parties and to do as the motion calls on him to do.  In doing so, the Minister and the Government will have the full support of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The restoration of Kilmainham Gaol was completed in 1971.  Apart from the significant cultural benefits this restoration afforded our country, it is also a major tourist attraction, seeing annual visitor numbers rise from 275,000 in 2009 to 285,000 last year.  I ask the Minister to retract his amendment to the motion in order that this House can collectively support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_848">I support the Sinn Féin motion which is supported by Fianna Fáil.  The commemoration of the Easter Rising and the importance of Moore Street is an issue of national significance.  I hope when the vote is taken tomorrow, the House will not divide on this issue.  In 2007, the Fianna Fáil Party in Government introduced a national preservation order to protect the site.  All sides have strong views about the need for this important site to be given the recognition and respect it deserves.  The centenary of the 1916 Rising is a source of immense pride for this country and it is essential the campaign to preserve and protect the national monument at Moore Street continues to be an entirely cross-party campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I come from Enniscorthy in County Wexford and I grew up on stories of Seamus Rafter, Thomas Weafer, Liam Mellowes and all the various people who were involved in 1916.  Henry Gough, a local historian, wrote in his book, <i>Proclamation, </i>about the significance of Enniscorthy in the 1916 Rebellion.  It was one of the few areas outside of Dublin that rose to support the colleagues in Dublin.  Pádraig Pearse visited Enniscorthy to address the troops and to rally them to ensure their support.  We grew up on the history of 1784, 1798, 1848 and 1867.  Henry Gough wrote it was little wonder that the spirit of 1798, nurtured by folk memories and oral tradition and kept alive by the Young Irelanders and the Fenians, should be reawakened at the foot of Vinegar Hill and that the rebellion in Wexford, Enniscorthy in particular, during Easter Week was the most significant event outside of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Deputy Ferris in particular will know that every year Enniscorthy Town Council holds its Easter commemoration ceremonies in the morning and Sinn Féin holds its commemoration in the afternoon.  The Liam Mellowes commemoration is held on the Sunday nearest to 10 December and the Fianna Fáil commemoration is held in the morning while the Sinn Féin commemoration is held in the afternoon.  I hope that between now and 2016, we could come together in Enniscorthy to hold one significant commemoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Even before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Enniscorthy Town Council invited the now Deputy Gerry Adams to come to the celebrations in the morning.  He was unable to attend but the now Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness came instead.  Prior to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Deputy Adams was invited to a hurling game between Tipperary and Wexford in Belleville in Enniscorthy when I was chairman of the club and prior to him speaking on Vinegar Hill.  Enniscorthy has a history of leading the way in the area of peace and harmony and I hope Enniscorthy and Wexford will not be forgotten when the Minister is organising the 1916 celebrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">We are speaking about the significance of Moore Street and I wish to remind the House of the significance of Enniscorthy.  The Government is not up to speed with regard to the commemoration of 1916.  County Wexford 1916 Bicentenary Trust Limited was set up in 2006.  It is a cross-party committee that is now preparing the way for the 2016 celebrations.  From the experience of how the 1798 Rebellion was celebrated, I know the committee will do justice to the memory of the men of 1916 who fought the good fight.  Etchingham was to the fore and the <i>Enniscorthy Echo</i> is still going strong.  It was one of the very few newspapers to support the Rising in 1916.  The Minister comes from a strong and proud tradition in County Kerry.  I ask him to ensure 1916 is celebrated in the way it should be and also that the Sinn Féin motion supported by Fianna Fáil and other political entities, will be accepted by the Government in the spirit in which it was tabled.  I ask him not to divide the House so that we can go forward together as Wexford did when celebrating the 1798 Rebellion and which it will do again with the Wexford 1916 Bicentenary Trust Limited.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_853">I move amendment No.1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_854">To delete all the words after "Dail Eireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_855">"---looks forward to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, a landmark in the history of the people of Ireland;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_856">---recalls that in January 2007 the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin, under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930, on the grounds that the buildings are of national importance by reason of their historical significance as the final headquarters of the 1916 Provisional Government;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_857">---acknowledges the hard work of the relatives of the signatories to the 1916 Proclamation of Independence, and all other campaigners, in raising public awareness of the importance of these historic buildings and this historic area of our capital city, and in securing the designation of the national monument;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_858">---recognising the historical importance of the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, welcomes the Minister's assurance that the monument is fully protected under the National Monuments Acts and that any development affecting it requires his formal consent under those Acts; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">---notes that the Minister will take full account of the role of the monument in the 1916 Rising in relation to any such consent application."</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I wish to share my time with Deputies Arthur Spring, Patrick O'Donovan and Michelle Mulherin.  I welcome the families of the 1916 leaders and I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this motion.  I have met representatives of the families, some of whom are in favour of this development and others who are opposed to it.  I have met them at a meeting of the joint committee and I have visited the site.  I am very familiar with both sides of the argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The Government's motion contains much of the substance and spirit of the original motion but better reflects the parameters of my functions under the National Monuments Acts with regard to the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, and the factors I can take into account in making a final decision on proposed works at the national monument site.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">At the outset, I want to state unequivocally that the buildings at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are robustly and comprehensively protected as a national monument under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts.  No change can be made to the buildings, internally or externally, without my express consent.  I can assure the House that I am fully committed to the preservation of the national monument and that I would not countenance any works which would impair or harm such an integral part of Ireland's history.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The 1916 Rising was a seminal event and a fundamental turning point in the history of the Irish people - a catalyst to a chain of events that would culminate in the creation of our Republic.  The actions and self-sacrifice of the men and women who fought for Irish freedom in Easter Week 1916 laid the foundations for the establishment of the Irish State.  It is the reason we are in this House this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The national monument at Moore Street has particular significance in the story of 1916 as the location of the last military actions of the leaders of the Rising: Pearse, Clarke, Connolly, Plunkett and MacDermott.  I am acutely aware of my responsibility as the Minister charged with the protection of this monument and I can assure the House that I am deeply committed to that role.  Indeed, I feel privileged to bear this responsibility in the run-up to the centenary of the events of 1916, being deeply cognisant of the central role that the national monument at Moore Street played in the events of 1916 and, therefore, its importance in the upcoming centenary celebrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Against that background, I want to join in paying special tribute to the relatives of the signatories to the 1916 Proclamation and the other campaigners who have managed to raise public awareness of the historic buildings on Moore Street.  Their hard work and commitment has ensured that there is a national monument there today.  But for them, what is now a national monument could have been demolished under planning permission granted in 1999 that would have allowed this to happen.  It was their efforts that led to the preservation order being placed on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street in January 2007 - a decision with which I fully concur.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The preservation order means that no works affecting these properties can start without my prior written consent under the National Monuments Acts.  However, it is important to note that the national monument is not State-owned; it is privately owned, as is the surrounding development site.  The current development proposal for the former Carlton cinema site, which includes the monument buildings on Moore Street, began its journey through the planning process in April 2008, after the preservation order had been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The development finally received planning permission from An Bord Pleanála in March 2010.  An Bord Pleanála's decision in 2010 took full account of the preservation order and the need for ministerial consent to be obtained under the National Monuments Acts before any works on or to the national monument could take place.  Indeed, the board went further in also requiring a full archaeological appraisal of the entire development site and the preservation and recording of archaeological materials or historical features within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">In addition, it requires a detailed project proposal to be prepared for the purpose of featuring and interpreting the historic significance of critical locations along the insurgents' evacuation route from the GPO to Moore Street.  These would be issues to be addressed by the developer with Dublin City Council in the context of the overall development of the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">In June 2011, I received an application on behalf of the developers for consent under the National Monuments Acts relating to Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  I want to categorically re-state that there are no proposals within the application before me either to demolish - or pull down, as Deputy Ferris said - these buildings.  Neither is it the case that only the facades will be retained.  The fact is that as much as possible of the internal and external structures are being retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The proposal is for Nos. 14 and 15 to house the main functions of a commemorative centre, while No. 17 would accommodate a specialist bookshop and other facilities for visitors.  Meanwhile, No. 16, the most important and iconic building, would serve as the focal point of the commemorative centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">There have been calls, echoed here this evening, for the national monument at Moore Street and the surrounding streetscape to be recognised as a historic battlefield and for it to be preserved as a historical or cultural quarter.  This is a completely and entirely separate issue to the consent application for Nos. 14 to 17, that is currently before me under the National Monuments Acts.  It is not clear how a battlefield site project could be developed in light of the existence of an extant planning permission.  This permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála, the independent body set up by the Oireachtas to adjudicate on planning consents where disputes arise as to whether or how developments should or should not proceed.  The permission was granted after comprehensive input from all interested parties to both the City Council and An Bord Pleanála, and in full light of the existence of the preservation order.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Notwithstanding that the wider area is not part of the current consent application, nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that Moore Street and its surrounds have not remained static since 1916.  Much of Moore Street itself dates from after 1916.  A great deal of alteration to buildings on the street has also taken place in the meantime.  For example, in so far as the terrace containing the national monument is concerned, Nos. 1 to 7 were built after 1916.  The buildings at Nos. 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 and 22 to 25, inclusive, all also date from after 1916.  I think this was pointed out by Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">In fact, Nos. 24 and 25 are a relatively newly built apartment block with a depot for the City Council's refuse collection service to the rear.  Within the terrace, the monument buildings themselves, Nos. 14 to 17, which are protected under the National Monuments Acts, are by far the most intact surviving buildings from the period of the Rising.  My immediate remit in this case, and the application currently before me, relates to those buildings.  I assure the House that I embrace and acknowledge their unique historical importance and character.  I endorse everything that has been said by campaigners about the need to preserve and protect them and I assure the House that I have no intention of allowing them to be put at any risk whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I think we can all also agree that the present appearance of the national monument buildings leaves much to be desired.  I am acutely aware of the imminent approach of the 1916 centenary celebrations and of the critical need for this massively important historical site to be brought up to a standard befitting the occasion.  Time is rapidly running out if this goal is to be realised and it is my intention to make a decision on the consent application as soon as the necessary deliberations and consultations have been completed.  I am currently in contact with the National Museum of Ireland and I will be bringing the matter back to the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations as soon as possible to update its members on developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I wish to assure the House that in considering and making any decision on the application for consent before me on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, my first, foremost and prime concern will be to arrive at a determination that will best serve the long-term preservation and protection of the national monument itself, and the commemoration and remembrance of the epic period and personalities associated with it.  In that context, I will take on board all the advice and guidance I have received, including during this debate, for which I am extremely grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I wish to remind Deputy Ferris that I am very much aware of the O'Rahilly family and am a personal friend of Prionsias Ó Rathaille, the grandson of The O'Rahilly.  In Listowel next Monday evening, I will be introducing a lecture on Alfred O'Rahilly who was The O'Rahilly's first cousin.  I am also aware of the Shouldice and Mulvihill families' connection to the 1916 Rising; all of them were from north Kerry.  I am therefore very much aware of the historical context.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I have a quasi-judicial function concerning the national monuments site.  I cannot accept the Sinn Féin motion because it would prejudice, and be seen to be prejudicial to, the exercise of my statutory function.  I want to point out clearly to all parties in this House that there is no issue between us as regards the protection of this national monument.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">In response to Deputies Troy and Browne, I would point out that it was unfortunate that when this site was being designated by the then Minister, Dick Roche, that he did not include the battlefield as well.  At that time there was no planning on the site and, therefore, no restrictions on him.  It was unfortunate that an informed debate such as the one we are having tonight did not happen prior to that because the site could have been designated totally at that time as a national monument.  While there is not a current planning application on the site, the fact that there is planning on it is a consideration for the battle site.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I sincerely thank Sinn Féin for raising this matter tonight.  It is important that we have a very good discussion on it and I hope it will take place in the proper spirit.  At the end of the day I will have to make a decision but I will be informed as much as possible before I make it because I realise how important it is.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_883">It is important to preserve those places and buildings that are vital to our country's heritage.  No. 16, Moore Street is one such vital place that could do with being restored.  When walking along Moore Street, many could be unaware that they were walking past the site of the final council of war of the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  The building is in a dilapidated state and does nothing to commemorate what took place there.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are currently on the record of protected structures in the Dublin City Council development plan and are protected as national monuments under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is being asked to determine an application for consent which would restore, preserve and enhance these buildings in the form of a commemorative centre.  The Minister is only tasked with determining the changes to the national monument and not the surrounding area.  The commemorative centre would promote No. 16 as the focal point while Nos. 14, 15 and 17 would be used to house other functions such as a book shop and a cafe.  No. 16 would be conserved with minimal alternations made so as to maintain the true character and spirit of the site for those who visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Sinn Féin's proposal would acknowledge the importance of the area but it would do little to move forward any project on No. 16, Moore Street before 2016.  This is the crux of what we need to achieve tonight, namely, to put the attention and focus on having this restored to a place of heritage and celebration before 2016.  The former structural glory of these buildings, which is not of architectural importance, is not what is at issue here.  The national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 must be recognised and celebrated for the role it played in 1916.  I do not wish to celebrate the bloodshed and the killing of men and women that took place; I wish to recognise the principles for which the people of the 1916 Rising stood, and I believe those principles are true for the majority of us in this House tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I came across these buildings when I was a student in Dublin.  Many students go to Moore Street to buy fruit and vegetables, and meat in the butchers shops.  A good friend of mine, Alan Bradshaw, a historian from Dublin, pointed out that those derelict buildings were of national importance.  I could not believe it when I saw them and was informed about them.  They are dilapidated, in an appalling condition and do nothing to celebrate the people, the culture or their legacy.  I know the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to be a man who is very passionate about heritage.  It is not because he found himself in this role as a Minister at point in time; it is a subject on which I have heard him speak from my early days of watching him as a politician and it is also one in which he has a personal interest.  I believe he will do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">There was some talk of the facade of the building being preserved and the rest of it being demolished.  That is not the case.  I do not believe that anybody here who would allow that to happen.  With no disrespect to Deputy McLellan, the possibility of it being destroyed or demolished is not something any of us would countenance on this side of the House.  We need to be as objective about it as we can be.  I do not think that any political party should try to grab hold of this issue</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The relatives of the 1916 families who are in the Visitors Gallery have played an enormous role in this, on which I commend them.  I think that we can celebrate this cross-party and cross-county.  It is ironic to note that every Deputy who has spoken on this motion so far comes from the four corners of Ireland and not from Dublin.  For those of us who come from 1916 families who were involved in Rising, we look forward to celebrating it, to recognising the roles that people played but also to a brighter future for the country.  We need to not only dwell on the past, but on the principles for which the people of 1916 strove and we need to re-evaluate our principles and look forward on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The GPO is a building of enormous importance.  I have brought visitors from all over the world to see it and it does not do justice to what it is.  It needs to be more than a general post office that is in operation in that it needs to be celebrated.  O'Connell Street also needs to be celebrated.  We need to get rid of every chipper on the street and celebrate it as the main street and thoroughfare of the capital of Ireland.  If we could get that street upgraded to a level where it is of tourist importance and the heritage site on Moore Street was recognised for what it is, that would only make things better for Dublin - those who are not from here would like to celebrate that.  I commend Sinn Féin and the Opposition on recognising what is important tonight.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_890">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I also welcome the presence of the Minister and the relatives of the leaders of 1916 Rising in the Gallery, whom I was fortunate to meet at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage, Transport and the Gaeltacht.  I will not repeat what has been said but it is important this issue is not politicised because all parties in this Dáil come from the foundation stone that was laid in 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The Minister's commitment to heritage is obvious and I welcome the response he gave to the motion.  I come from that part of the world from where Con Colbert, who was associated with the 1916 Rising, came.  This is not only a Dublin issue, it is very much a national issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">While I agree with a great deal of what has been said, there is a bigger context to this, namely, the total destruction of the north side of Dublin city centre from O'Connell Street out.  It is not only Moore Street, which is main part of this motion.  What Dublin City Council has allowed to happen to the main thoroughfare of our capital city during the past 20 or 30 years is a scandal.  Where were the councillors when decisions were being made to turn the largest and one of the finest boulevards in the world into a monument of neon, plastic and tack and the surrounding three or so blocks around O'Connell Street?  Where was the Dublin City development plan in this context?  This is the same Dublin city development plan that was adopted recently and we found we had a massive problem with regard to a site for the national children's hospital.  Yet the council could allow the destruction of the Georgian and Edwardian Dublin to the scale where the principal locations of where the 1916 Rising was fought has been shrouded by plastic and neon.  It is a scandal to think that at no stage did Dublin city councillors, of any party, say that enough was enough when these development plans were being adopted.  I found it embarrassing when, along with a colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I  stood facing the GPO during the 1916 commemorations in O'Connell Street a few months ago and noted that to my back there was nothing but plastic and all sorts of rubbish, for want of a better word, that has no place in the main street of any capital city, let alone a street that is of such historical importance as O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">What has happened in Moore Street is symptomatic of what has been allowed to happen to the entire north side of Dublin.  It begs the question that if the 1916 Rising had happened on the southside, would we be even having this argument.  We probably would not.  That needs to be said.  In fairness, the area has been very badly treated.  I pull no punches when it comes to An Post either because, as Deputy Ferris said, one has to go rooting around to find the memorabilia that commemorate the 1916 Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">When one contrasts what we have in Dublin with sites such as Gettysburg, Antietam, Waterloo and anywhere a struggle for independence or battle took place one can see how successive management teams, council teams and governments have failed Dublin city centre.  I am not from Dublin but this is of huge significance to me . What we allowed happen on O'Connell Street permeates outwards.  With great aplomb we erected a monument to the Celtic tiger, namely, the Spire.  It is a soulless characterless piece of metal dumped in the middle of O'Connell Street.  It draws one's eye up to the top of it but what does one get then?  One's eye returns to earth fairly rapidly with an anticlimactic "well, what was that about?".  It is typical of what the Celtic tiger years did to the country.  Perhaps consideration might be given to naming it after a certain politician who served the constituency of Dublin Central with such distinction.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I welcome the Minister's proposed amendment to the motion.  I congratulate Sinn Féin.  I can be very critical of Sinn Féin when I need to be, but in fairness it is an absolute scandal that we are even discussing in the Dáil what we have allowed happen to Georgian and Edwardian Dublin and to buildings with architectural significance never mind historical significance.  Rural Deputies will know that some fellow from the local authority will come out to plank a preservation order on a bunch of rocks and stones with a bit of thatch on top of them.  We have allowed the main street in our capital city to be turned into something like the sea front facade of a resort in the south of England.  What Dublin City Council has allowed to happen is a scandal.  Will the Minister, at the earliest opportunity, arrange for the manager of Dublin City Council to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht so he can put forward a plan for this national thoroughfare because what the local authority has allowed to happen is an absolute disgrace?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichelleMulherin" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</from>
          <p eId="para_896">I must disagree with Deputy O'Donovan because I really like the Spire and I am not from Dublin.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I like seeing the rain trickling down it.  However, this is not pertinent to this debate as it is art as opposed to what we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I welcome passion for remembering and commemorating our history, the people, the decisions they made and the events which epitomise our struggle for the freedom we enjoy to self-determine as a people, not that we must all agree but that we have this freedom.  Using bricks and mortar is a limited means to do so but is the only way we can state what happened mattered to us as a people, that it is significant now and will continue to be significant so long as we are a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">To take a slightly different tack, as the Minister stated when he spoke so earnestly, this monument is a protected structure and he does not intend any destruction to it.  The condition it is in is not desirable for such an important place but we have a statutory process which we should not sidestep.  The Minister has been approached by people who are for and against the proposed development which has planning permission.  The statutory process came about through the Parliament, which has its roots in the 1916 Rising which occurred at a time when there was a state of chaos in the country and people wanted a stable society with respect for law and order and rules and to be able to self-determine as a people in a parliament.  According to the statutory process the Minister must deliberate, consult and consent or not, and he should be allowed to do so because this is what the law states.  We should not sidestep this no matter how much passion we have.  I have full confidence in the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">With due respect to Sinn Féin which tabled the motion, in the Seanad it has tabled amendments to the Statute Law Revision Bill to abolish the Offences against the State Act which criminalises activities detrimental to the security of the State.  Sinn Féin tells people to break the law by not paying the household charge.  This does not fit because we are parliamentarians.  We work through the system and democracy is burdensome and requires much work, but it means dialogue and I believe Sinn Féin appreciates dialogue at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I do not want to go over the detail and the real significance of this, which has already been mentioned by other speakers, but I am delighted plans are afoot so we may see something done with this monument by the time we commemorate 1916.  There are ways and means to commemorate.  It does not mean having exactly the same as what was there before and I will give an example from a rural area close to where I live.  A stone cottage from the townland of Carradoogan near Attymass near Ballina in County Mayo, which was left derelict because of mass emigration, is now part of the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park, Lower Manhattan not far from where the World Trade Center stood.  It was taken stone by stone and reconstructed in Battery Park.  While it is not in its original place, it is nonetheless a testament to all the people who suffered during the famine and through emigration, and more people get to see it in its current location.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">With regard to the buildings on Moore Street, any development should be done respectfully, taking on board advice from museums, archaeologists and other experts so the buildings have due respect and credence as the national monument we want them to be.  I respect the process that must take place.  The Minister is aware of the seriousness and sensitivity required for the right decision to be made with regard to having something in place by the time of the commemorations in 2016.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_903">I welcome the motion tabled by Sinn Féin.  What struck me most about the representations I received in recent weeks was the fact that many people stated many historic buildings and places in this country have not been recognised and many of them are under threat.  I found this hard to believe.  I read through some previous debates from the Dáil and Seanad, including a debate in which I took part in the Seanad in 2004 when we discussed amending the National Monuments Act.  During the debate we discussed the battle of Aughrim and the battlefield mentioned by the Minister when speaking on this motion.  I welcome what Sinn Féin is doing through this motion because these issues are part of our history and heritage and we should have more debates on national monuments.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">As has been stated, when in government Fianna Fáil introduced a national preservation order on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street which declared the buildings were of national importance by reason of their historic significance.  Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú made a very strong case in the Seanad with regard to the buildings.  No. 16 was the last place of refuge for the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising.  They were forced to abandon their GPO headquarters and take refuge there in what were to be the last hours of the insurrection.  Leaders including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett, Sean McDermott and Thomas Clarke took refuge in this house on 29 April, the day before the unconditional surrender by Pearse.  Under this preservation order, Nos. 14-17 Moore Street would be afforded the same status and protection as a priceless historical structure.  One article I read compared it to Newgrange.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">In 2007, the then Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Dick Roche, said: "In the decade leading up to the centenary celebrations of the 1916 rising it would be unconscionable for the Government not to close any potential legal loophole which might result in the loss or destruction of a national monument such as No.16 Moore Street to future generations."  It is regrettable for this building to have a neglected or vacant appearance.  Earlier the Minister spoke in positive terms about his concern.  I hope that there will be agreement between all involved - An Bord Pleanála, Dublin City Council and the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee - on the idea of developing there with a conservation plan for the historic site.  The committee, whose members include relatives of the signatories of the 1916 and whom I welcome to the debate, has done much to raise public awareness of the importance of this historic address.  Members of the committee have made presentations on a number of occasions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and they have highlighted their campaign once again.  I look forward to exploring with the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee how this area of Dublin can be developed in a balanced manner that respects the historical significance of the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I ask the Minister to act without further delay to ensure the plan to transform this site with the full preservation of the national monument is carried out.  The Minister mentioned the battlefield site, which is certainly important.  It will greatly enhance our national heritage and the tourist potential in our capital city as we approach the centenary of the Easter Rising.  Many of us received representations from a French art historian and museum professional who talked about having this building in its place beside Kilmainham Gaol as a top attraction in the guidebooks, which is something to which we should all look forward.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_907">I am very glad to have the opportunity speak in support of the motion before us tonight urging the Government "to act without further delay to ensure the full preservation of the national monument and to develop a plan to transform the GPO-Moore Street area into an historic quarter and battlefield site".  The motion is signed by some 50 Members of the House.  The signatories to this motion come from differing political backgrounds and viewpoints.  These are Deputies who might not agree on much - in recent weeks we have been in deep disagreement on some important issues facing the country, notably the stability treaty - but on this issue we are at one.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I have no doubt many Deputies on the Government side of the House feel equally strongly on this issue and would happily sign this motion if they had the opportunity.  This need not and should not be a cause or an opportunity for political point scoring across the House.  The issue is not whether we believe in preserving and protecting this site.  I believe there is near unanimity in this House on that.  The issue is about demonstrating the clear and absolute resolve in achieving it.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The clock is ticking on this issue.  While some may comfort themselves thinking the 1916 centenary is almost four years away, that time will pass quickly.  Deputies should bear in mind it is already more than five years since Mr. Dick Roche as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930.  I suggest we do not have four years, or anything like it, to resolve this matter.  It is vital to get this matter resolved positively and speedily as we are entering a decade of important and significant commemorations for communities and traditions both North and South.  For republicans and Nationalists the Easter 1916 commemorations will be the high point of that decade of commemorations, but there are other commemorations in that decade that are of considerable importance to our island as a whole.  These include the signing of the Ulster Covenant, the 1913 Dublin Lockout, and the formation of the Irish Volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The Moore Street site is only a short walk from the Rotunda Hospital where the Irish Volunteers held their first meeting in 1913.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, set the tone for this decade of commemoration in a speech to UCD's Institute for British-Irish studies in May 2010:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_911">The events of the decade between 1912 and 1922 were momentous and defining ones for all of the people of this island, and indeed for these islands.  This was the decade of the covenant and the gun, of blood sacrifice and bloody politics, a time of division and war, not only on this island but across the world.  It was the decade that defined relationships on these islands for most of the last century.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, chairs the Government committee that is tasked with co-ordinating and choreographing many of these commemorations.  That decade has already commenced.  Last April saw the anniversaries of the foundation of the Ulster Volunteers and the publication of the third Home Rule Bill.  As the year progresses the Minister and his officials will increasingly find themselves engrossed and focused on the range and variety of commemorations.  That is why it is vital the issue of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is resolved and acted upon now.  My fear and the fear of many of us in Fianna Fáil is that the longer the protection of the Moore Street site is delayed, the less of the historic site will be left to protect and preserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The Government must act now.  This is not a matter of questioning or doubting the Minister's commitment to the aim, but rather one of requesting that the Minister and his officials show greater resolve and determination to finalise the issues quickly.  We are aware there are complications and differences of opinion.  We also realise there are varied interests and the Minister's powers are limited.  The Minister's leadership is needed to progress this important issue.  The laneways and streets surrounding Moore Street are some of the most historic in the nation.  They are among the last remnants of the battlefield that part of Dublin became during the Easter Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The Moore Street buildings we are discussing tonight are where the leaders and defenders of the first Provisional Government retreated from the burning GPO.  It is where, on 28 April, the leaders of the rebellion decided to surrender.  Moore Lane still contains some buildings and cobblestones from the period.  This is where the fight continued as the 300 men of the GPO garrison sought to make it to safety in the Moore Street buildings while under fire from British guns.  Many of the original Easter Rising buildings no longer exist.  The former Liberty Hall is gone.  Having been so heavily shelled and attacked, the GPO is now effectively a reconstruction.  The building, where the Proclamation was signed by Tom Clarke, Pádraig Pearse, James Connolly, Sean MacDermott, Joseph Plunkett, Thomas MacDonagh and Eamonn Ceannt, no longer exists.  The site is now marked by a tarnished and hard to spot plaque on the outside wall of a store on Henry Street.  It is from 16 Moore Street that Pearse sent Cumann na mBan nurse, Elizabeth O'Farrell, under a white flag, with a note for General Lowe stating he wished to surrender.  Nurse O'Farrell subsequently carried Pearse's instruction to surrender to Boland's Mills and Jacob's factory.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I am very glad to have had the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam cupla focal a rá faoin ábhar seo agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go ndéanfaimís cuimhniú ar na láithreacha a bhí lárnach do Éirí Amach 1916.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Brendan Smith, tá go leor den Stát atá againn anois bunaithe ar aois na ndaoine a chuaigh amach i 1916 ag iarraidh saoirse a bhaint amach don tír seo.  Is minic a smaoiním ar an argóint atá ann scaití idir an féinriail agus an phoblachtánachas a bhí mar chroílár an Éirí Amach.  Tá sé tábhachtach a rá gurb é mo bharúil dá mbéadh rogha saor ag pobal na hÉireann ag aon am ó lár na naoíú aoise déag ar aghaidh, dá mbeadh reifreann saorcheart ann, go roghnóidís poblacht seachas féinriail.  Is ceart dúinn a aithint freisin, go raibh tionchar nach beag ag an Éirí Amach ar shlánú na Gaeilge agus gur ar éigin go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar atá sí i láthair na huaire sa tír murach an Éirí Amach.  Ní léir domsa go mbeadh aon stát seachas poblacht sásta an Ghaeilge a cur mar chéad teanga oifigiúil ar an Stát agus tús áite a thabhairt di ar an gcaoi sin.   Tá ceantar fíor-starúil againn i láthair na cathrach, idir Ard Oifig an Phoist agus Sráid Uí Mhórdha agus na lanaú timpeall uirthi, agus is ceart iad a chaomhnú mar aonad.  Molaim go mór an obair atá déanta ag daoine go deonach, ag iarraidh an cás seo a bhrú chun cinn.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil gach uile taobh den Teach seo ar an tuairim go mba cheart beart a dhéanamh anseo.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scéal sách casta ann, ach má chuireann gach aon duine le chéile is féidir éacht a dhéanamh.  Níl sé i bhfad ó shin ó rinne éacht maidir le láthair Chath na Bóinne.  Má bhíothas in ann é a dhéanamh dó sin is féidir an rud céanna, agus níos mó, a dhéanamh le comóradh a dhéanamh ar an Éirí Amach.     Mar sin, tá mé cinnte go mbeadh tacaíocht ag an Rialtas ó gach uile thaobh den Teach má thugann sé faoi séadchomhartha náisiúnta ceart a dhéanamh thart ar an gceantar sin le go mbeadh daoine a thiocfadh anseo ó ar fud an domhain le ceiliúradh agus comóradh a dhéanamh ar an Éirí Amach in ann a fheiceáil cár tharla na heachtraí móra i stair na hÉireann.   Le fada an lá, tá mise ag tathaint go bhfuil go leor spáis taobh istigh d’Ard Oifig an Phoist chun chuid mhaith den láthair sin a thabhart ar láimh le haghaidh músaem náisiúnta na saoirse a chur inti.  Má thagann cuairteoir, stráinséar nó turasóir go Sráid Uí Chonaill, is aisteach nach ndeirtear leo cad é Ard Oifig an Phoist.  Tá beagáinín de thaispeántas ann ach níl aon rud mór ann.  Tá go leor taiscí ag Ard Músaem na hÉireann.  Le haghaidh 2016, ba cheart músaem náisiúnta na saoirse a lonnú in Ard Oifig an Phoist ionas nuair a thiocfadh cuairteoirí ag iarraidh a fháil amach céard a tharla ann go mbeadh scéal na saoirse ar fáil ansin, ní hamháin scéal an Éirí Amach ach scéal iarracht phobal na hÉireann saoirse a bhaint amach.  Tá Ard Músaem na hÉireann anseo i Sráid Chill Dara, tá cuid eile de thíos i gCaisleán an Bharraigh agus cuid eile i mBeairic Uí Choileáin, ach an áit go mba cheart na séadchomharthaí a bhaineann leis an Éirí Amach agus leis an troid ar son na saoirse, ag dul i bhfad siar go 1798, ar fad a gcoinneáil is ea Ard Oifig an Phoist, agus ba cheart cuid den bhfoirgneamh a chur in oiriúint dó sin.  Molaim go mbeadh sé sin mar chuid de rud i bhfad níos mó, is é sin an moladh seo maidir leis an láthair i Sráid Uí Mhórdha.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_917">Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil náire agus díomá orm go bhfuilimid go fóill ag caint faoin ábhar seo.  Ba cheart go mbíodh plean gníomhaíochta againn blianta ó shin.  Dá mbíodh, bheadh ionad stairiúil againn anois, agus slí stairiúil ó Ard Oifig an Phoist go dtí Sráid Parnell.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">It is very disappointing that we are still talking about the historical area from the GPO to Parnell Street and all the places associated with the Easter Rising.  Every Government from the foundation of the State has neglected to make a fitting memorial there to the men and women of the Easter Rising.  Indeed, it could be said that each Government and the local authority have allowed all of the sites associated with the various battle scenes of the Rising to become derelict and, in some cases, allowed them to be demolished.  Kilmainham Gaol could have been knocked down by a developer some years ago only for the actions of a dedicated group of people who worked to preserve it.  It is now one of the most visited sites in Dublin, with excellent guides.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">One can see the efforts and manoeuvres that have gone into almost bringing about a similar fate for the area of Moore Street.  I acknowledge the relatives' group and its trojan work to keep this item on the agenda.  I also acknowledge Sinn Féin bringing this debate to the Chamber.  At the commemoration committee meeting today there was a proposal from a member for a 1916 Rising walking trail around the area, similar to the Freedom Trail in Boston.  It would be mortifying to do that walk now, given the dereliction of the area.  However, we are aware of its potential.  The Minister and other Ministers have made the tour, as have other people, and I have been on it several times.  We know that it could be a historical walk in a historical quarter with suitable preservation and conservation.  There is a story at every step of that walk from the GPO, around to Parnell Street, where the surrender took place, and further up to the Garden of Remembrance and into Mountjoy Square if we wish to develop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">We visit cities in eastern and western Europe and the places we visit there are the historical quarters.  Even in economic terms, they are doing very well for the cities where they are situated.  I live in East Wall and my journey, as a teenager, was from East Wall, along the GPO, through Moore Street, Moore Lane and O'Rahilly Parade to my secondary school, Mount Carmel in King's Inn Street.  I felt privileged to do that walk.  The walk should be preserved for other people.  It is a battlefield site, commemorating a momentous historic event in our history which had far-reaching consequences.  With regard to designating Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street as a national monument, it is currently a national disgrace.  I have stood inside those houses and felt frustration at what was allowed to happen.  However, I also felt very positive about what could be achieved, not just with Nos. 14 to 17, which is not enough, but the entire area.  It suits some to focus on protecting Nos. 14 to 17.  That is all very well, and I am sure it will be protected, but the entire area is a battlefield site.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">Dublin City Council has many questions to answer about this, dating back to 1998 when the Carlton Group was given planning permission.  Then there was a bizarre agreement between the council and Chartered Land in 2004.  There was an issue of compulsory purchase orders and whether the councillors had a vote.  They were ruled out of order when they tried to raise the matter as it was considered <i>sub judice</i>.  There was an<i> in camera</i> meeting in November 2006, Supreme Court judgments and various toing and froing to An Bord Pleanála.  In December 2010 and October 2011, demolition and alterations were carried out without permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The traders are another aspect of Moore Street which should be mentioned as they are part of that history and culture.  I acknowledge the work of the late Tony Gregory in trying to preserve that.  There is also the matter of Nos. 32 and 33 Henry Street and the preservation of Henry Lane.  We have an opportunity to create a historical quarter and historical walkway in time for the centenary.  The expression "tír gan teanga, tír gan anam" is well known but respect for and preservation of our heritage sites are also central to the soul of a country.  I listened to the Minister talk about Nos. 14 to 17 but is it appropriate that this national monument, all alone, will be dwarfed by apartments, shopping malls, arcades and God knows what else the developer might put there?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
          <p eId="para_925">I am happy to conclude the discussion on Second Stage of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012.  This legislation will address some of the difficulties being faced every day by small and medium enterprises, SMEs, throughout the country, which I have been made aware of daily since being appointed Minister of State last year.  The ability of our SMEs to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for employment, growth and prosperity, and this Bill shows our commitment to implement change and reform in a step by step approach, to re-energise the economy, meet the challenges of recovery, address a failed economic model, restore confidence and to enhance Ireland's position in the world.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_927">I wish to respond to some of the comments made by Members.  In the context of the finer details of how the scheme will operate, the Minister will lay the scheme before the House as soon as this legislation is enacted.  This provision is provided for in section 6 of the Bill.  As for the use of personal guarantees, the banks still will be able to consider the normal and usual ways that security is provided by borrowers.  Invoice discounting will be eligible for the guarantee scheme.  The guarantee will be for three years but the loan may be for a longer term.  The legislation provides for the premium payment to be paid upfront.  However, this matter of the timing of the payment is being reconsidered and amendments may be tabled on Committee Stage.  The scheme will be demand-led and the Government will follow performance and take-up closely.  If figures show that demand exceeds €150 million, this figure can be revisited and amended, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Regarding loans that are defaulted, the banks will follow their normal recoveries procedures.  This matter of recoveries will be covered in the scheme.  As for the issue of late payment of invoices causing difficulties to small businesses, the Department will transpose the new EU directive on late payments before 16 March 2013.  With regard to ensuring additionality of lending under the guarantee scheme, the Department is in talks with the banks at present to ensure they fully understand their obligations.  The loans provided under the scheme will be closely monitored to ensure they fall within the two market failures the scheme is designed to address.  In respect of the risk-sharing ratio, this is a joint commitment by the Government and the banks.  The combination of guarantee rate and default limit will deliver an overall risk share of 50:50.  Losses over the default rate must be borne by the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">In the context of the microfinance fund, it will avail of the EU progress guarantee facility as soon as the lending entity is established.  I also point out that First Step, which lends to micro-enterprise, already avails of this EU guarantee facility.  Any further issues to which I have not responded will be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">As my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, noted in his opening comments on commending the Bill to the House, The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012 prioritises where it will place its efforts to best effect over the coming months.  It adds up to a co-ordinated plan of vigorous and targeted action in order that the Government achieves change and makes a difference.  Businesses need action from the Government, not words.  This legislation is clear evidence of concrete action that will produce tangible benefits for the businesses that avail of the guarantee scheme.  The Bill will help restore confidence, which is an integral part of economic health.  It also forms an essential part of our recovery.  Businesses must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding their order books and payrolls.  Banks must be willing and able to lend sufficiently to meet the needs of business again.  Consumers must regain the confidence to spend again.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The Government's overall strategy is aimed at making sure citizens and businesses feel confident it has their interests at heart and is implementing necessary change.  The strategy is to ensure they have an outlet for entrepreneurial initiative and marketable ideas and the chance to turn them into commercial products.  Making sure they can confidently go into business and create jobs is an essential element of the Government programme and making sure that Ireland is strongly perceived as a good place to do business is essential in generating such confidence.  The Government has committed to making Ireland, to quote the Taoiseach, "the best small country in the world in which to do business" by 2016 and it can achieve that target.  The Government has a legitimate and important role in improving the finance environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Carefully designed legislative interventions, such as this measure, can help markets function better, give certainty to business and confidence to consumers.  I believe this legislation will inspire confidence among SMEs in the banks' abilities to provide an improved service to SME customers, including previously discouraged borrowers.  It has been frequently acknowledged in the recent past that there will be a cohort of discouraged borrowers who assumed they would be turned down and therefore did not apply for credit.  The introduction of a guarantee scheme may help to support this group to pursue business opportunities again.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The majority of Ireland's enterprise sector comprises small businesses.  Now more than ever, ambitious and energetic business owners, entrepreneurs and managers who can play a real part in driving a positive uplift in the economy are needed.  They are the job creators and innovators and must be encouraged and supported to have the confidence to make their mark and build a better future for themselves and this country.  These are the all too often unseen risk takers and innovators and it always will be the hard-work and entrepreneurial skills of such individuals that will lie at the heart of the success of Ireland's SMEs.  All these companies have financing needs through the various stages of business development such as start up, managing working capital, investing in new products or services, marketing strategies, innovation and research and development, expanding output and entering new markets.  It is essential that the financial system supports the needs of SMEs through all these stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Many businesses have contacted the Department about the problems caused by their difficulties in accessing credit.  All Members, as public representatives, are aware of the difficulties that face people within their constituencies and nationwide.  Increased risk aversion among banks has made it significantly harder for smaller companies to obtain finance in recent years compared with the period before the crisis.  Herein lies the mismatch between the needs of productive business and the bank finance available.  While banks are trying to reduce risk, business lending, especially to SMEs, is risky.  Entrepreneurship is risky.  Introducing new products and services is risky.  Exporting to emerging markets is risky.  Innovation is risky.  This Bill will enable the Government to absorb some of the risk of lending in order that businesses can get on with what they do best.  We must dismantle unnecessary barriers that stymie growth and hold back investment.  That is exactly what this Government is determined to do and this Bill moves us in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I personally have met various companies that are at the margins of SME commercial lending decisions because the businesses have insufficient security or the lender does not have the skills to carry out an appropriate assessment of the business proposition.  It is essential to address this issue in a way that will not reduce the onus on banks to honour their commitments to increase SME lending overall but which would facilitate additional lending over and above those commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">In conclusion, this Bill is important legislation.  It will assist in the Government's plans to reshape the finance landscape to render it more effective in meeting the needs of Irish businesses.  The Government is taking decisive action to create the environment that supports new companies, new jobs and new economic opportunities.  I refer to action that keeps open the doors of Irish businesses, supports existing business to scale up and expand and facilitates more people who have the ambition and drive to set up their own business.  This Bill is just one of the many steps for delivery of such a challenging agenda.</p>

         his views on the progress the EU has made in relation to its sanctions on Iran; if negotiations have been ongoing with the regime in relation to their nuclear programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_939">Given the major concerns which exist over the Iranian nuclear programme (as documented in a series of UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions since 2006), and given Iran's continuing unwillingness to engage seriously on these concerns or to address the serious findings highlighted in the IAEA's reports, the international community has had little option but to impose several rounds of increasingly tough restrictive measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">These include an EU embargo on Iranian petrochemical products which started on 1 May and a ban on crude oil imports to the EU which is due to take effect on 1 July.  Under the terms of the Council Decision implementing these sanctions last January, a review of whether to proceed with the oil embargo and ancillary measures is to be conducted before 1 July.  The review will be undertaken at the June Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">I have no doubt that it was the EU's measures, complemented by tough bilateral sanctions implemented recently by the US, Canada and the UK, which were instrumental in triggering Iran's belated acceptance of talks recently.  I welcome in this regard the discussions between the E3+3 and Iran which resumed in Istanbul on 14 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">At the April Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended, EU High Representative Ashton briefed Ministers on these talks.    She judged these to have been more constructive than earlier rounds, with the Iranian side attaching no preconditions to further talks and both sides agreeing on the need for confidence-building measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">A further round of negotiations has been scheduled for 23 May in Baghdad.    It is hoped that this will enable a clearer judgement to be made of the seriousness of commitment on Iran's part to making real progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">Ultimately, the grave issues arising in relation to Iran's nuclear programme can only be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and not by any other means.  Ireland, with its EU partners, will continue to lend strong support to High Representative Ashton and the other members of the E3+3 as they pursue the ‘twin-track' approach which is aimed at persuading Iran to negotiate seriously — and which now appears to be paying some dividends.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_946">I understand the legislation referred to by the Deputy has passed into law in the Saint Petersburg region. While this type of legislation purports to protect young people, it is more likely, in my view, to result in further stigmatisation, and even criminalisation, of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) young people.  In fact, I am aware of reports that an individual has recently been convicted under this legislation and understand that he intends to appeal the verdict.   A senior official in my Department was in contact with the Russian Embassy to express concern at this legislation when it was introduced last year. In addition, the European Union, with Irish support, raised this matter with the Russian authorities at an EU-Russia human rights dialogue held in Moscow last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Earlier this year, the EU communicated, formally, its concerns to the Russian Federation authorities about the legislation and Ireland has again been supportive of these efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">Just last week in a dialogue on human rights with the Duma of the Russian Federation the EU again underlined its concerns on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">This Government is strongly committed to combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity and considers that discriminatory legal or administrative provisions which curtail the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are not acceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_951">I am concerned at any reports of violence against human rights defenders in Colombia.   I would fully expect the Colombian government, no less than any other government, to protect its citizens from attack.   Human rights defenders and trade union representatives can be particularly vulnerable in this regard and additional vigilance is required in preserving their safety.  The Deputy will be aware of the EU policy of dialogue with the government of Colombia. This offers the best way to support democracy and further the objectives of the Santos administration with regard to improving human rights and moving forward the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">High Representative Ashton has voiced on many occasions the EU's support for the Colombian government's effort to improve security and to drive forward the peace process in a country which is emerging from decades of civil war.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">As I have outlined on many occasions in the House, Ireland actively supports this policy of dialogue and engagement. I underlined Ireland's concerns over human rights, in particular at the alleged harassment of human rights defenders and trade union activists, when I met the vice-president of Colombia during his visit to Ireland in January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">Together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland will continue to support these efforts and to monitor the situation through our embassy in Mexico City.</p>

            <p eId="para_956">The European Union is strongly committed to the promotion of sustainable and inclusive economic development in Africa.  It employs a carefully differentiated approach to its engagement on trade with developing country partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">Since 2002, the EU has been negotiating a series of new Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.  They were necessitated by World Trade Organisation (WTO) rulings that the unilateral trade preferences previously granted to the ACP countries established unfair discrimination between developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">Several years ago, there were well-founded concerns that momentum was being lost in the negotiations and that the original shared commitment to the achievement of Agreements which serve the development needs of African countries was being lost.  However, agreement was reached at the EU-Africa Summit in November 2010 that both sides should move "to conclude Economic Partnership Agreements that support socio-economic development, regional integration and the integration of Africa into the global economy".</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The European Commission last year engaged actively and flexibly in renewed negotiations at the regional level.  It also adopted a proposal in September, which is to be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of Trade Ministers, to set a deadline of 1 January 2014 for the conclusion of the negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The Government has at all stages made it clear that Ireland supports a negotiating approach that is as flexible as possible under WTO law and underlines the importance of a strong partnership approach.   I do not agree with the suggestion that, in the negotiating process, EU interests are prioritised above fair trading policies.   Both EU and African leaders have recognised clearly the potential benefits of these Agreements and, at their most recent meeting in March, the EU Trade Ministers acknowledged the need for flexibility and pragmatism on both sides to find solutions to outstanding issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Ireland will continue to work with our partners for Agreements which clearly support the development priorities and needs of the African countries and we will engage positively with the Commission on these issues during our Presidency of the EU next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_963">The person referred to by the Deputy first came to the attention of my Department on 15 November 2008 when one of his sisters contacted our Embassy in The Hague seeking assistance in locating him. She advised that he had not been in touch with his family since 23 October which was unusual for him. Officials from my Department have remained in contact with his family since then and provided all possible consular assistance through our Embassy and the Consular Assistance section in Dublin.  On 2 December 2008 an Embassy Official arranged and attended a meeting between two of his sisters and a Dutch Police Officer who had been assigned to the case.  The Officer assured the sisters that everything possible was being done to locate their brother.  He agreed to put a photo of their brother on the Dutch Police Intranet so that it would be available to police throughout the Netherlands.  He also gave his contact details to the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">I am informed that our Embassy contacted a Dutch television programme which features missing person's cases to ensure that this case was featured.  Our Embassy has also provided the family with information and advice on placing advertisements in the Dutch media.  In addition, our Embassy has also assisted the family by contacting the Irish citizen's bank in the Netherlands and his mobile phone company there.  However, under Dutch law, information on private individuals (including bank activity and mobile phone usage), cannot be released, even to an Embassy or a member of the individual's family, without the individual's explicit consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The strictness of Dutch privacy laws and the limitations of my Department's role in missing person's cases were explained to the family during a meeting with them by my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Micheál Martin, T.D., on 4 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">On 14 March 2012, the family called to the Embassy of the Netherlands in Ireland and handed in a letter expressing their dissatisfaction with the handling of the case by the Dutch police.  The Dutch Public Prosecutor subsequently decided to re-examine the investigation into the disappearance.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">On 7 May 2012 officials from our Embassy in The Hague met with the Dutch police officers responsible for the case to discuss the current status of their investigation.  The Dutch police officers confirmed that they are following up on a number of items pertaining to the disappearance.  Our Embassy will remain in contact with the police and keep the individual's family informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">The family has expressed a wish to meet with the police officers and our Embassy has offered to facilitate this at its offices.  Arrangements are being made to find a mutually suitable date for such a meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">While my Department cannot interfere in the legal process of another state, we will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal sympathy to the family and to assure them of my full appreciation of the distress the disappearance of their loved one has caused.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">The humanitarian situation facing the Sahrawi people is a matter of profound concern.   The majority of refugees from the Western Saharan conflict live in four camps in the desert regions of Tindouf in Algeria, all of which rely heavily on international aid.   Ireland is one of a very small number of donors who have been involved in the provision of humanitarian support to the Sahrawi refugee population.  Earlier this week, the Government approved €250,000 in support for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency which is one of the key agencies providing life-sustaining assistance to many of the refugees.  This funding will help UNHCR to provide ongoing assistance to vulnerable people in the camps, notably in the areas of water and sanitation, health, nutrition and education. In addition to providing assistance in the Tindouf camps, UNHCR is also implementing a "Confidence Building Measures" programme which facilitates family visits between refugees living in the camps and their families in the Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">Morocco is one of Europe's closest neighbours and is covered by the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy.  The EU is engaged in wide-ranging cooperation with Morocco under the existing Association Agreement, including efforts to promote democratic reform and economic modernisation.  Morocco is also a key partner for the EU in relation to tackling illegal migration.  While Ireland disagrees with Morocco's policy in relation to Western Sahara, that would not in itself provide grounds for us to attempt to block overall EU cooperation with, or support for, Morocco as it seeks to introduce democratic reform and economic modernisation.  In fact, I believe that the gradual process of democratisation underway in Morocco may assist in the long term in reaching a compromise with respect to Western Sahara.   The EU's political dialogue with Morocco under the Association Agreement also provides an invaluable forum for raising concerns directly with the Moroccan Government as regards both the internal human rights situation in Morocco and the question of Western Sahara. Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, and the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination.  Addressing human rights issues is a key ingredient to the successful resolution of the conflict.  We will raise our concerns about human rights issues in Western Sahara with the Moroccan Government during the Universal Periodic Review of Morocco which is taking place in the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva today. We   will also continue our dialogue with both Morocco and Polisario, through the Moroccan Ambassador to Ireland and the local Polisario representative, so as to encourage support for the UN Secretary General's good offices mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.</p>

            <p eId="para_974">The Parliamentary elections in Armenia took place on 6 May. They were observed by an Election Observation Mission from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), as well as delegations from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, and the European Parliament.    The EU, other than the European Parliament, does not organise election observation missions in countries where elections can be credibly or systematically observed by other international organisations or local stakeholders.  In order to avoid duplication, the EU does not deploy observation missions in the countries belonging to the OSCE area as EU member States are members and core funders of the OSCE, which organises monitoring missions in its member countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The EEAS does of course closely monitor political developments in Armenia, including through the local EU delegation, and this informs discussion by Foreign Ministers within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">The joint report on the Armenian elections found that there had been a vibrant and largely peaceful campaign, with overall balanced media coverage, but that pressure on voters and a deficient complaints process had created an unequal playing field.  These elections were held under a new electoral code which, in the judgement of the international observers, provided a sound legal framework for conducting democratic elections.   However, stakeholders had failed to implement important aspects of the new law.  The manner in which complaints were dealt with, the report found, had undermined the right to legal redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">As Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, I have taken note of the report.   ODIHR will issue a comprehensive final report on the elections in the next few weeks, which will include recommendations for potential improvements.   This final report will provide a basis for the work needed to improve electoral standards in Armenia before the Presidential election next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The EU Delegation in Yerevan will also be involved in cooperation with the OSCE Office and ODIHR on these issues, given that Armenia is in negotiations for an Association Agreement with the EU.  The holding of elections in accordance with international standards is an important requirement in the latter context.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">I have requested that our Embassy in Sofia, which is accredited to Armenia, remain in touch with the OSCE Office and with the EU Delegation in Yerevan in relation to their work on electoral standards.   I hope to visit Armenia this year and to have an opportunity to discuss progress on this issue during my meetings with Armenian interlocutors.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">The OSCE, as the world's largest regional security organisation, plays an important role in ensuring peace, stability and security within the area which it covers (sometimes described as "from Vancouver to Vladivostok").   The collective goal of the Organisation, as agreed at the Astana Summit in December 2010, is to work towards a genuine Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community, rooted in agreed principles, shared commitments and common goals. The so-called ‘Corfu Process', a process of consultation among the OSCE's 56 member States, contributed to reaching agreement on this objective at the Astana Summit. Discussions in the interim have focused on how to achieve the goal of a Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community.   As Chairman-in-Office, I circulated at the beginning of our Chairmanship a document entitled "From Astana to Dublin: Towards a Security Community, Building Blocks for 2012".   Building on the mandate received at Astana, we want to identify the elements or "building blocks" of an action plan that could be put in place to reach this goal.<b/>This will be one of the themes for<b/>  the Annual Security Review Conference to be held in Vienna on 26-28 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">As part of this process, the Irish Chairmanship has proposed that we use the 40th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act in 2015 as an opportunity for OSCE participating States to measure the progress  being made towards the security community.  Discussions of this proposal are already underway. A Chairmanship food-for-thought paper was discussed at a meeting of OSCE Ambassadors on 8-9 May.  This paper sets out a vision for the "Helsinki+40" concept which could, in time and subject to agreement, reinvigorate discussions about an OSCE security community.  Consultations on this document will continue over the coming months.  Our aim is to take a forward-looking approach, involving the Chairmanships up to and including 2015, with a view to having a concrete action plan, as mandated by the Astana Commemorative Declaration, completed by the 40th   anniversary in 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">On 21 April, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2043 (2012) authorising the establishment, for an initial period of up to 90 days, of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS).   On 24 April, in response to a request from the UN to participate in this mission, the Government approved the deployment of up 6 members of the Defence Forces to UNSMIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">On 11 May six members of the Defence Forces were deployed to UNSMIS as unarmed military observers. The presence of these observers is essential to international efforts to effect a change in conditions on the ground. <i>  </i>  Good progress has been made in relation to the overall deployment to UNSMIS and I understand that over 200 observers are now on the ground and that the full complement of 300 observers is expected to be in place later this week.  An additional group of 75 civilian personnel is also being put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The role of the Irish and other UNSMIS observers is to monitor and report on the security situation and on any transgression of the ceasefire agreement, as well as on the implementation of the six-point peace plan of Mr. Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League Joint Special Envoy.  The observers have set up monitoring units in the principal cities in Syria, including Homs, Deraa and Hama which have been the scenes of major conflict and shelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The ongoing violence and the continued difficulties in ensuring adherence to the 12 April ceasefire and promoting full compliance by all sides with the six-point peace plan are matters of great concern and underline the severity of the challenges faced by UNSMIS.  Incidents such as the attack on a Syrian Army convoy accompanying a UNSMIS observer team (including the Norwegian Force Commander) which was visiting Deraa on 9 May and the improvised explosive attack on the UNSMIS convoy near Hama on 15 May are completely unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Ireland and its EU partners will continue to offer the fullest possible support to UNSMIS and to Special Envoy Annan in their efforts to promote a peaceful settlement.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_990">Combating global hunger and undernutrition is a central pillar of the Government's overseas development programme.  We are making good progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2008 report of the Government's Hunger Task Force.  Just last week, the Tánaiste and I announced that we have delivered on the commitment to direct at least 20 per cent of the Irish Aid budget to actions and programmes to reduce hunger.  Reaching this target has involved a reorientation of elements of the development programme to ensure a stronger hunger response at country level and globally.   The Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which we launched last September, aims to build a more coherent approach to Ireland's relations with Africa, across all sectors:  development, political and the establishment of closer economic and trade links.  This includes the encouragement of indigenous African production in the food sector, leading to a growth in African exports and increased two-way trade.  The establishment of an Africa Agri-Food Development Fund, which was launched jointly by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine in March, builds on this commitment and on the recommendations of the Hunger Task Force Report.  It aims to involve the Irish private sector in greater trade and in investment in food production and processing in Africa. We believe that the private sector in Ireland has the potential to bring a wealth of expertise and technical knowhow to the Agri-Food sector in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">A technical mission, which included representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and Enterprise Ireland, visited Kenya and Tanzania last month. It confirmed the potential for the Fund in a changing Africa and identified a number of opportunities which will be presented to the Irish Agri-Food sector for their consideration in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">In both Kenya and Tanzania, food needs are increasing due to population growth and rapid urbanisation, and local production is unable to meet the growing demand. As Irish companies increase their trade with Africa, we anticipate that they will also explore opportunities for new investment with African partners, creating the potential to generate much needed jobs and economic growth.  This approach reflects our commitment to working with our African partners to end extreme poverty and hunger and promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth and opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_994">I am monitoring closely the case of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, who was arrested on 5 May on his return to Bahrain from Lebanon for comments he had made on a social networking site criticising the Ministry of the Interior in Bahrain.   Mr. Rajab has now been charged in court on 17 May with inciting protests through the use of social networks.    Mr. Rajab's case highlights issues regarding respect for such fundamental rights as freedom of expression.  Bahrain has an obligation, as a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, not to place onerous restrictions on the exercise of free speech.  Governments do not have to agree with the opinions and views of citizens but they must allow their citizens the freedom to express their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">At Bahrain's Universal Periodic Review yesterday in Geneva, Ireland recommended that Bahrain amend any articles of its Penal Code that can be used to prosecute individuals for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or association, and bring its law in line with international standards established by the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. Officials in my Department have also raised my concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain with the Bahraini Ambassador in London.  In addition, the Ambassador in Riyadh has relayed my concerns directly to the Bahraini authorities.  Concerns about Mr. Rajab's detention have also been expressed to the Bahraini authorities by senior EU officials visiting Bahrain on 17 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">I have already made clear on a number of occasions, including in this House, my own deep concern and that of the Irish Government and people regarding the general human rights situation in Bahrain.  While I welcome the reforms already initiated by the Bahraini authorities in response to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, I remain concerned that more needs to be done to address the legitimate demands of those peacefully seeking reform and greater inter-communal dialogue.  Demonstrations and unrest in predominantly Shia communities are still continuing,   underlining the urgent need for comprehensive follow-up to the recommendations of the BICI report.  A way must be found through dialogue to chart a new and inclusive future for Bahrain and I urge the Bahraini authorities and the opposition to engage genuinely and meaningfully in Bahrain's national reconciliation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 135, 141 and 199 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The welfare of the Irish abroad is a very important priority for the Government.  There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The Government's keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our friends within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">With a view to helping some positive momentum around immigration issues insofar as they relate to Ireland, enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas has been a particular focus of our efforts.  Proposals currently being discussed among members of the US Congress would, if adopted, make 10,500 E-3 visas available to Irish citizens each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">During my visit to Washington in February this year, I reviewed progress on E-3 issues during meetings with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and with the Friends of Ireland group in the House of Representatives and with Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">I also discussed prospects for progress with the Congressional Delegation led by leader Nancy Pelosi in Dublin in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">During his recent visit to Washington, the Taoiseach raised immigration with President Obama and with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and the Friends of Ireland Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">While I am heartened by the advances that have been made so far towards bi-partisan consensus in the  US Senate towards enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 visas, I am conscious that passing any immigration-related legislation in an election year in the US presents very significant challenges. Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with all relevant actors, including our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives with a view to ensuring that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1017">Ireland has 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions as well as 10 Consulates General and other offices overseas.  While the specific activity of each mission in relation to the promotion of Ireland's economic and trade interests will necessarily differ, depending on market conditions and other factors, bilateral Embassies and Consulates in particular have a role to play in promoting trade and investment opportunities.    Our Embassies and other offices abroad are generally small with one or two diplomats in many cases. Given the multi-faceted nature of their work and the wide range of promotional activity across the Embassy network it is not feasible to provide a detailed breakdown of the activity of each Embassy.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the promotion of Irish trade and exports is a key priority for my Department and the entire Embassy network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">Embassies are engaged on a continuous basis in efforts to promote Irish products and services and in looking for new opportunities for Irish exporters in markets overseas. They frequently provide a platform to market Irish companies to a global audience. Embassies regularly host promotional events for, and in association, with State Agencies and they also actively contribute to the organisation and conduct of trade missions, including those where Enterprise Ireland client companies travel to markets overseas. The Trade and Promotion Division of my Department works closely with Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in planning such missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">In putting together programmes of trade and promotional activity for Ministers and other visitors to their region, the Embassy network ensures that incoming high level visits are leveraged for maximum impact.  The St. Patrick's Day period is, of course, an occasion for particularly intense activity by the Embassy network in this context but such promotional activity is ongoing throughout the year. As a matter of course, Ambassadors and other Embassy staff work constantly with key political, economic, business and media contacts in their countries of accreditation.  The success of high level visits as well as of day to day promotional activity to advance Ireland's interests overseas is dependent on the Embassies nurturing these contacts in what is often a highly competitive environment, particularly in the major and emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">Embassies also have a key role to play in assisting in the resolution of problematic regulatory issues and gaining access to new markets for Irish products and services.  Under the Government's Trade Strategy,   27 priority markets have been identified for the integrated promotion of trade, tourism and investment.  These include the BRIC countries as well as other key emerging markets. In these countries, our Ambassador chairs a local market team which consists of the Embassy and representatives from the relevant State Agencies in the field. These market teams submit annual market plans as well as six monthly reports of activity, which are reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">I would add that the role of my Department and the Embassy network in trade promotion and in building Ireland's economic reputation abroad is, of course, complementary to the wide range of enterprise development activity which other Government Departments and the State Agencies pursue in the domestic context to support Irish business in entering international markets.  Enterprise Ireland and other State Agencies have a range of programmes in place to stimulate entrepreneurship, to encourage innovation, to provide funding and business space for enterprise, to assist companies to achieve scale and develop competitiveness and to develop management capabilities and strategies for growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_1356">Ireland's National Action Plan in relation to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security was officially launched in November 2011.  The Plan sets out how Ireland will promote and implement the objectives of UNSCR 1325 in its programme support activities, diplomatic advocacy and policy-making across the interrelated areas of peace, security and development.   Implementation of the Plan remains an important priority for my Department.  A meeting has been arranged between my officials and key stakeholders from civil society to discuss how best to take the NAP forward.  One of the items for discussion will be the formation of a monitoring group under an independent chair which will oversee implementation.  I look forward to productive discussions and cooperation in that format.</p>

            <p eId="para_1359">The issue of prisons within Northern Ireland and the conditions contained within is a devolved matter related to the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland and an executive agency of this Department, the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Arising from the Hillsborough Agreement of February 2010 which led to the devolution of policing and justice, Dame Ann Owers and the Prison Review Team were commissioned to undertake a 360 degree review of the prison system which had a very strong focus on how best to protect the human rights of individual prisoners. Following this review, in October 2011 a report into prison reform was published by Owers which made forty recommendations related to prison reform in Northern Ireland. Much progress has been made to date in implementing the recommended reforms contained within this report.  Where particular issues or allegations arise in relation to conditions in Maghaberry Prison or any other prisons in Northern Ireland which affect an Irish citizen, the Government will continue to raise the matter with the relevant authorities where appropriate. The full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Owers Report remains the most effective way to ensure that conditions within all prisons in Northern Ireland are of an acceptable standard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">The next session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) will take place in Geneva from 21 May to 4 June 2012.  Fourteen countries will be reviewed at this session, including Indonesia.  Under the UPR process, each UN member state is subject to a thorough review of its human rights by the UN Human Rights Council.  The reviews are based on information provided by the state concerned, compilation reports prepared by the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) and input from NGOs.  As part of the UPR process, states have the opportunity to participate in an interactive dialogue with the state under review.  The UPR process is a valuable contribution to raising standards and increasing awareness of human rights.  Ireland will participate actively in the process, and will submit questions and recommendations with regard to a number of states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">Ireland does not have a resident embassy in Indonesia, which we cover from our embassy at Singapore.  Mechanisms such as the UPR provide, therefore, a valuable forum in which to engage on issues which might otherwise not be covered bilaterally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">The 3rd Indonesia-EU human rights dialogue held on 2 May in Jakarta also provided a framework for open and constructive discussions between the EU and Indonesia on a wide range of human rights issues of mutual interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">This dialogue took stock of progress in implementing key human rights commitments — including Indonesia's third national action plan on human rights (2011-2014).  A broad range of issues was discussed such as non-discrimination and tolerance, the rights of detainees and prisoners, women's rights, freedom of the press, and the death penalty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">The issue of non-discrimination, especially with regard to the challenges to freedom of religion and belief, was given particular attention.

            <p eId="para_1372">In my recent address to the Dáil to mark Europe Day, I referred to how, over the past six decades, the European Union has transformed a continent that for so long was torn apart by war and division which shattered the lives of millions and wiped out generations.  Today's EU is built on the ideals set out by the founding fathers of the Union following the devastation of World War II.  Based on the fundamental principles of democracy and respect for the rule of law, our Union has created peace, and it has given us a degree of prosperity, whatever we may feel about our current situation, that earlier generations of Europeans could only have dreamed of.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The EU has been good for Ireland.  It has been central to our economic and social development and it has expanded our horizons.  But Ireland has also made an important contribution to the development of the European Union, and I believe that we have more to offer.  Our goal as Presidency will be to be an effective and efficient manager of EU business.  The Presidency also provides us with an opportunity to shape policy and legislation which can have a positive impact on the lives of many.  We will seek to promote measures aimed at boosting jobs and economic growth.  Among the priorities emerging on that front are the importance of advancing agreement on the EU 2013-2020 budget to support the Union's efforts as a whole, promoting greater economic and social security across Europe by supporting the Europe 2020 process, and safeguarding stability through the operation of an improved and better coordinated system of economic governance.  These measures will be good for Europe but also good for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">The Presidency will allow Ireland to highlight its strengths and capabilities on the world stage at a time when we are working to rebuild our positive reputation abroad.  We have always seen the value in and been a supporter of the Community method because it ensures fairness to all Member States.  In that regard, I agree very much with the sentiment in the Deputy's question that respect and mutual support are essential qualities among Member States in our Union.  They are qualities without which we would not have made the progress we have made either as a Union or indeed as a Member State over our own forty years of membership, and they are qualities which will prove crucial to Europe's future success.</p>

            <p eId="para_1376">There are currently 58 resident Embassies in Ireland.  As advised in my reply of 29th of March, the operation of these Embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 as transposed into Irish law by the Diplomatic and Immunities Act 1967.  Privileges and immunities of accredited diplomatic agents in Ireland are governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963, as incorporated into Irish law, by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act of 1967 and as amended by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act of 1976.  Where traffic violations or other such issues concerning a resident Embassy or Embassy staff accredited here are brought to the attention of my Department by An Garda Síochána, the Department reminds resident Embassies about their obligations under Article 41.1 of the Vienna Convention 41.1 to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state and informs the Embassies concerned which generally operate in compliance with Irish law.  My Department works to ensure that the law is upheld and will assist, as appropriate, in any investigation being undertaken by the relevant Irish authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">My Department expects all those diplomatic agents duly accredited here, who are entitled to privileges and immunities in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, to respect Irish laws and regulations, as indeed, we expect our Embassies abroad to respect the laws and regulations of the host country.  I would recall that the purpose of diplomatic privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the effective performance of the functions of diplomatic missions.  In addition, Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention provides that the immunity of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving state does not exempt him from the jurisdiction of the sending state.  I would assure the Deputy that my Department will do everything it can consistent with its obligations under the Vienna Convention to ensure fair treatment for all.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_1380">I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The Government's aid programme, and our development policy, are central to Ireland's foreign policy.  Our programme is recognised internationally for its focus on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, for its effectiveness in delivering development results in some of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and for its partnership approach.  We can be proud of the role Ireland has played in helping countries previously mired in poverty to make progress across the Millennium Development Goals.  Africa is now a changing continent, with many countries achieving growth rates of over 5 per cent annually over the past decade.  However, extreme poverty and hunger persist in some areas, and we have seen in recent times the devastating effect of humanitarian emergencies in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel region.  The Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade responds to the complexity of the African continent today.  The Government is now building a more coherent approach to promoting Ireland's relations with Africa, based on the progress enabled by Official Development Assistance and creating new links in the areas of development, political relations and the promotion of economic and trade opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">As Minister with responsibility for trade and development, I know that the provision of aid is only one element in the promotion of inclusive economic growth.  Increased participation by developing nations in world trade has real potential to as an engine for economic growth, for equitable income distribution and for the elimination of extreme poverty.  It generates revenues and employment, reduces prices on essential goods, and promotes technology transfer and increased productivity.  I am determined that Ireland's aid programme will remain focused on the fight against poverty and hunger and that it will remain untied.  However, it is in the interests of African countries and of Ireland that we prepare for expanded ties with African countries as they achieve greater economic and social development.  I look forward to relationships with African countries which have moved away from aid dependency, which will involve strengthened trade, investment, tourism and people-to people links.  This process will of course take time, and progress will be faster in some African countries than in others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">Ireland and our EU partners strongly support the multilateral rules-based trading system which is the central goal of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  At times of global economic challenge we need a WTO that is robust enough to apply transparent trade rules for the benefit of all and ensures that more trade opportunities are opened up for developing nations.  We recognise that developing countries need support in order to participate fully in the WTO and to take advantage of global market opportunities.  Ireland is playing its part in this process, including through the provision of financial support to the WTO's programme of technical assistance and training, and to bodies such as the Advisory Centre on WTO Law and the International Trade Centre.  Last year, we provided over €2 million in such assistance for developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">The Government also strongly supports the carefully differentiated approach by the European Union to its engagement on trade with developing countries in Africa.  EU trade policy is helping the poorest economies by providing generous unilateral trade preferences through the Generalised System of Preferences Scheme.  This includes the ‘Everything but Arms' scheme which provides duty-free and quota-free access for goods from Least Developed Countries.  The EU is also negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, and Ireland is working with our partners to ensure that the negotiations lead to Agreements which will serve the development needs of African countries, based on their own poverty reduction programmes.</p>

The use of genetically modified (GM) food and crops as part of this effort is a matter for the government of each developing country, and we respect their decision in this regard.  Ireland will continue to focus on reducing hunger through improving smallholder farmer productivity, addressing maternal and infant under-nutrition and enhancing political commitment to tackle the root causes of hunger.  As part of this, we look forward to engaging with other development partners, particularly developing country governments, civil society and our counterparts in the European Union, United States, and United Nations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1388">The Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition, currently under development by Committee on Food Security of the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation, will set out priority areas of action for all stakeholders involved in development cooperation to effectively tackle global hunger and food and nutrition insecurity.  It will draw on existing frameworks, consolidate and complement them, and, importantly, it will ensure coherence between them.  The key areas for action in the current iteration of the Global Strategic Framework are all fully aligned with the recommendations of the Irish Hunger Task Force Report, which was published in 2008.  They include the need to support smallholder farmers, and in particular women farmers, to boost their agriculture yields, and investing more in agriculture research and innovation to help poor farmers grow more nutritious food to feed their families.  The work will also focus on support for proven nutrition interventions, with a special focus on pregnant women, mothers and infants and the need to support more effective governance in food and nutrition security at global, national and local levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">Combating global hunger is a key pillar of our foreign policy and our overseas development assistance programme.  Just last week the Tánaiste and I announced that we have delivered on our target of directing twenty per cent of the Irish Aid budget on hunger reduction.  Reaching this target has involved a reorientation of our development programme to ensure a stronger hunger response at country level and at the global level.  It clearly marks Ireland out in global terms as a nation that is committed to the fight against hunger.  While officials in my Department are actively involved in the development of the Global Strategic Framework, lead responsibility for Ireland's engagement with the process rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and attendance at the thirty-eight session of the Committee on Food Security in Rome later this year is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney T.D.</p>

            <p eId="para_1393">The issue of extraordinary rendition has been raised on numerous occasions in this House.  As has repeatedly been made clear, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of the extraordinary rendition of prisoners to or from any destination, including Guantanamo Bay.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government states that the Government "will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purpose not in line with the dictates of international law".  In this House on 17 January 2012, I stated: "We do not tolerate and will not tolerate the use of our airspace or airports for any illegal purpose — for torture, rendition or the unauthorised detainment of any individual".  This position is unchanged; Ireland remains totally opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">Immediately following the first reports suggesting that the US was practising extraordinary rendition to transit prisoners, the then Government demanded and received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners had not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.  These assurances were confirmed at the highest political level.  They are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the Government.  I am satisfied, as previous Ministers have been, that it is appropriate for the Government to rely fully on these assurances.  It is likely that a small number of commercially leased aircraft which have been involved in legitimate commercial activities have also been involved at various times in activities related to extraordinary renditions.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these aircraft were carrying prisoners at any time when they transited through Irish airports, including Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Where allegations have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda Síochána.  In no case has any evidence been adduced to support claims that extraordinary rendition had occurred.  If anyone has evidence to suggest that any person subject to extraordinary rendition has transited an Irish airport during this process, this evidence should be made available to An Garda Síochána, so that an investigation can take place.</p>

My Department has worked to ensure the continued development and success of the international financial services industry in Ireland since the launch of the IFSC in 1987 with the support of Government Departments, Agencies and the industry through the mechanism of the IFSC Clearing House Group (CHG) which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  During this period, the IFSC has grown to employ 33,000 people and contributes over €1billion annually through corporation tax and payroll taxes.  Last year the Clearing House Group assisted in the preparation of the Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland 2011-2016 which sets the objectives of creating more than 10,000 net new jobs, protecting existing employment and consolidating the sector as a key driver of the Irish economy over the next five years. As the Deputy may be aware, I appear annually before a Select Sub Committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, most recently on 19 April 2012, where members had an opportunity to question me in relation to the revised estimates, outputs and impacts of the work of my Department.  The Secretary General of my Department also appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 3 May 2012 where members had the opportunity to question him about the role and work of the Department.  As the Deputy is aware the legislative and  policy framework for financial services including the international financial services industry and taxation policy are primarily the responsibility for the Minister for Finance and specific questions regarding these issues should be addressed to Minister Noonan and his Department.  However, I am open and willing to exploring any additional mechanisms with regard to enhancing the accessibility of the deliberations of the IFSC Clearing House Group and have asked my Officials to consider the matter.</summary>

        <b> Deputy Niall Collins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Taoiseach</b>
         if he will detail, in tabular form, the total photography costs for his Department since coming to office inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance; the list of occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the breakdown of costs associated with each occasion that a photographer was used; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <summary eId="sum_31">The Taoiseach: The total spend by my Department on photography from 10th March 2011 to end of April 2012 is €31,291.32.  This figure includes photography costs for major events such as the Visit of President Obama and the Presidential Inauguration.  Increasingly my Department utilises its own staff to take photographs in house thereby reducing costs.  The comparable cost in 2008 for example, was €83,398.00.  For major events and inward state visits my Department continues to use the services of a professional photographic agency.  As requested, the following table gives a breakdown of costs for each occasion a photographer was engaged since March 2011.  A framework for the provision of professional photography services has been finalised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is now open to all Government Departments.  My Department has contacted the service providers in the framework to provide a quote for its photographic requirements.</summary>

          <summary eId="sum_33">In view of the temporary nature of the work involved in planning and preparing for the forthcoming EU Presidency the emphasis being taken in relation to the filling of posts is to manage as far as possible within existing departmental resources, to seek redeployment from elsewhere in the public service or to fill them by way of temporary recruitment following an open competition.  Last year other Departments and Offices were asked if they would be able to second staff to my Department to work on the Presidency and two staff joined my Department following this process.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_34">Following an open competition held earlier this year a number of graduates with qualifications on EU related disciplines are being recruited on a temporary basis to support Ireland's work on the EU Presidency.  To date six graduates have been recruited from the panel and I expect four more to be recruited shortly.   The employment contracts of staff recruited from the panel are for up to 18 months.  The total annual salary cost to my Department of staff redeployed or recruited for the EU Presidency so far is €290,264, including employers, PRSI.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_35">My Department also intends to recruit a number of Administrative Officer Economists later this year from a separate open competition that was held by the Public Appointments Service.  The recruitment of graduates with specialist economic skills is considered necessary to support my Department's policy capacity in this important area.</summary>

            <p eId="para_1805">Table A1 shows the estimated trend in the number of employees over time broken down by the different classifications used in this release.  It should be noted that the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment.  The figures presented above refer most closely to the number of employees as estimated by the QNHS but differ in coverage in certain ways, such as the fact that a person with 2 jobs could be counted twice in the table and the exclusion of the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector which is covered by the QNHS.  The estimates presented above are particularly useful in assessing the impact of employment changes on overall average earnings and hours paid.  For example if the proportion of Managers, professionals and associated professionals increases over time this would, all other things being equal, increase average earnings levels as this occupational group has higher than average earnings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1880">Total public sector numbers are also published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a quarterly basis. Those differ in coverage from the estimates in Table A2 as Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimates are based on full-time equivalents which will change over time based on both changes in working hours and number of persons employed. The estimates in Table A2 represent the estimated total number of employees within the public sector. Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimates also exclude commercial semi-state bodies so for comparability purposes a figure excluding semi-state bodies is included in Table A2.  Differences in the level of the two sets of estimates primarily reflect part-time employment within the different sectors which would generally cause estimates on a full-time equivalent basis (i.e. those produced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) to be lower. Differences in trend could be caused by changes in the proportion of part-time staff within the public sector and/or other changes in average working hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">The CSO will undertake further analysis to produce estimates on total hours worked for future releases to give a better insight into changes in overall labour input within the public sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2064">As Ireland is not a member of NATO, the question of attendance at the NATO Summit in Chicago does not arise.  In accordance with usual practice, an invitation was extended to the Taoiseach to attend a meeting which will take place on the margins of the NATO Summit between NATO Heads of State and Government and non-NATO countries who contribute to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.  Ireland is one of the latter countries.  This meeting will take place in Chicago on Monday 21 May following the NATO Summit.  The Taoiseach will not be attending; Ireland will be represented at this meeting by a senior official of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">It is expected that the discussion among ISAF contributors at this meeting will focus on the transfer of responsibility for security in Afghanistan from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces, a process which Ireland fully supports.  In recognition of the importance that a secure environment plays in achieving a stable and democratic Afghanistan, Ireland has participated in the UN-mandated ISAF mission since 2002; seven members of the Defence Forces are currently serving in non-combat roles at ISAF HQ in Kabul.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">Ireland has also seconded police and civilian experts to the EU Police Training Mission in Afghanistan.  In addition, we have, since 2005, provided over €35 million in funding for humanitarian assistance and civil society development programmes as well as support for the Government of Afghanistan through the World Bank-managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2068">The size of the European Union budget is governed by the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), which specifies the limits for spending under the various budget headings for seven years.  The Commission made a formal proposal for the MFF 2014-2020 in June of last year.  This proposal, which provided for a maximum of €1025 billion over seven years, is now the subject of active negotiations between the member States, principally in the General Affairs Council.  The Government's view is that the overall size of the MFF proposed by the Commission last June provides a good basis for negotiations.  Many Member States are pressing for a reduction in the overall amount and this is a key issue in the present negotiations.  Ireland wants a properly funded and properly functioning EU, with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  The EU must have a budget that is fit for purpose.  EU funds must be spent in an efficient and effective way, and streamlined with the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Jobs and Growth.  At the same time, the Budget must reflect current budgetary consolidation imperatives in Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">In a related but distinct process, the Commission issued a proposal on 25 April last for the European Union annual budget for 2013, which is negotiated in a separate legislative process involving the Council and European Parliament.  This proposal is subject to the overall limit set out in the current MFF (2017-2013), and was for a Budget of €138 billion in Payments Appropriations, an increase of 6.8% over the 2012 Budget. This proposed increase arises to some degree by virtue of the fact that 2013 is the last year of the current EU budget cycle 2007-2013 and consequently, there is a large number of prior EU payment commitments that fall due next year.  The Commission's proposed budget will be intensively debated over the coming months and will require approval by both the European Parliament and by EU Member States in the Council before it can be adopted.  Ireland will engage actively in this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2074">The various measures included in the package agreed at Weston Park in August 2001 addressed four issues to assist in the successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement: policing, normalisation, the stability of the institutions and decommissioning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">Proposed draft legislation by the British Government to deal with this specific issue as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Weston Park accord was formally withdrawn by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain MP, on 11 January 2006. The draft legislation, the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, had been opposed by the majority of the Northern Ireland Assembly parties and the Secretary of State was compelled to withdraw the legislation when the only supporting party, Sinn Féin, could not accept certain aspects of the proposed legislation. The Government remains committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">On the particular issue of securing early release for Mr. McGeough, it is our understanding that the prisoner in question has initiated legal proceedings to secure an early release and judgment on this is pending. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment any further at this stage other than to confirm that officials from my Department continue to monitor developments very closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_2078">Following the decision to close the Embassy to the Holy See it has been decided to relocate both the offices of the Embassy to Italy and the residence of the Ambassador to Italy to the state-owned Villa Spada.  It is expected that the transfer will be completed this year and that the full year rental savings, amounting to €445,000, will be realised in 2013.  As I have previously stated in this House, the decision to close the resident Embassy to the Holy See will not be reversed in the immediate term. However, as the economic situation improves, and in the context of the regular review of our diplomatic network, it may be possible to revisit the matter at some time in the future and to consider re-establishment of a resident Embassy to the Holy See on a modest basis.  However, I would not expect any such development to impact on the decision to locate our Embassy to Italy in the Villa Spada.</p>

            <p eId="para_2082">Graduate entry to the diplomatic service is at Third Secretary level.  This is handled centrally by the Public Appointments Service.  Unfortunately, due to the current moratorium on recruitment into the public sector, no Third Secretary competition is currently planned.  In recent years, my Department has offered a limited number of short-term internships for graduates in the areas of human rights, conflict resolution, disarmament and legal affairs. As they arise, these internships are advertised through the careers offices of Irish third-level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The Department's Development Cooperation Division, which administers the Irish Aid programme, also offers a number of 18-month internships in development assistance to appropriately qualified candidates.  It is expected that further such positions will be available in 2013.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_2085">The theme of this year's session of the UN Commission on Population and Development was ‘Adolescents and Youth'.  This was particularly timely, given that the number of young people globally has now reached an all time high of 1.2 billion. The session focused on key challenges in meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of young people and adolescents, in line with the commitments made by the international community at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). Maternal mortality, HIV prevalence and the unmet need for contraception all remain high among the 15-19 year age group in developing countries, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa.  Providing reproductive health care services and information to young people is therefore vital for progress in achieving international development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">Ireland fully supports the comprehensive and forward-looking Resolution which, significantly, was adopted unanimously by the Commission.  I very much welcome the emphasis in the Resolution on the key importance of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and on the need for governments to ensure access by young people to sexual and reproductive health care services, comprehensive evidence-based education on human sexuality and sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes.  These are areas to which Irish Aid attaches particular priority and which we support on an ongoing basis through our development cooperation programme. In particular, through Irish Aid, the Government has a long standing relationship with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), whose work in the area of sexual and reproductive health is increasingly focused on meeting the needs of young people. Since 2006, Ireland has provided almost €34 million in core and project funding to UNFPA. Ireland will be a member of UNFPA's Executive Board in 2013 and I look forward to working closely with them on the full implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action as we reach its 20th  anniversary.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2090">The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), established as part of the Good Friday Agreement, plays a key role in developing deeper economic and social ties through bringing together relevant Ministers from the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  The NSMC also reviews the work of the North-South bodies, such as InterTrade Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a co-ordination role in regard to the work of other Departments in this jurisdiction on North/South matters.  North South Ministerial meetings in all sectors have taken place in the last six months.  Most recently, on 27 April, I met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in a meeting of the NSMC in Institutional format, where we discussed cross-cutting issues, including EU matters.  A Plenary Meeting of the NSMC will take place on 15 June, when the Government and the Executive will review progress to date and discuss further cooperation to address current economic challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">In addition to the activities of the NSMC, the President, Taoiseach, and I, as well as other Members of the Government, regularly undertake visits to Northern Ireland.  President Higgins most recently visited Derry on 24 April 2012 when he gave a lecture at Magee College in Derry.  The Taoiseach visited Belfast on 18 April 2012 when he delivered the Chancellor's Lecture at the University of Ulster.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">I addressed the Alliance Party Conference in Belfast on 18 April and held a bilateral meeting with Alliance Party Leader David Ford, who is also Justice Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">The Reconciliation Fund administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aims to assist individuals and organisations involved in reconciliation work and to encourage and facilitate better relations within and between the political traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  The Anti-Sectarianism Fund provides financial assistance to projects in communities seeking new and more effective ways of addressing the urgent challenges posed by sectarianism and division in society. An Inter-Departmental Committee, comprised of representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality and from my own Department meets several times a year to review received applications and put forward recommendations for funding.  Since 1982, the two Funds have disbursed some €37 million to over 800 projects.  This year €2.7 million has been allocated to these activities and consideration of a first round of applications is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">I would also acknowledge the important role played by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and other Joint Oireachtas Committees which have increased their contacts and co-operation with Committees in the Northern Ireland Assembly and with other actors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2104">Work is under way on the administrative planning for the EU Presidency which is being taken forward by my Department.  This work involves close coordination with the Department of the Taoiseach, with other Government Departments and with the OPW.  An Inter-Departmental group meets on a regular basis to update on policy and developments in this area. In tandem with this, a meetings coordinators network comprising all Departments was established early in 2012 and now meets on a monthly basis to discuss detailed logistical planning for events that will take place in Ireland during the Presidency.  A Government decision of 20 December 2011 agreed, inter alia, that <i>“additional resources in the order of €60 million, plus security costs”</i>, is required to fund the Presidency and that Dublin Castle and other State-owned properties in Dublin will be the default venues for all Presidency-related events in Ireland. In addition, the planning approach agreed foresees the provision of centralised services to Departments for the Presidency where it is advantageous to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">This centralised approach, led by my Department, is being adopted in order to reduce overall resource costs, to ease the administrative burden for other Departments and to avoid duplication of effort.  This includes the procurement of goods and services required for the Presidency and work is underway on a centralised procurement scheme for all goods and services that will be required for the running of the Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">In formulating our Presidency programme priorities, my Department has placed a clear emphasis on realistic and achievable objectives shaped by national positions.  Furthermore, as has been the practice of successive Presidencies under the post-Lisbon Treaty arrangements, the Presidency will be led by our Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">In tandem with the cross-cutting theme of job creation and economic growth, my Department has identified three key areas during the Presidency:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2108">Working with the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, to promote effective EU action in support of international peace and security;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2110">Shaping progress on major Development dossiers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">Additionally, under the Lisbon Treaty the powers of the European Parliament have increased substantially under the ordinary legislative procedure. As such, early engagement with the Parliament on key legislative dossiers (such as the MFF) is now an integral and critical aspect of our Presidency.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2122">I am deeply concerned at the current situation which has seen escalating violence in recent days, notably the appalling indiscriminate bombing that struck the city of Damascus on 10 May as well as continued shelling of urban centres, such as the town of Rastan, by Syrian armed forces.  While there had been some initial diminution of violence following the ceasefire which originally came into effect on 12 April, this unfortunately has not been maintained and overall levels of violence and casualties are rising steadily.  The overall pattern of the conflict has also altered in recent weeks, with more indiscriminate bombings and acts of random violence (including by opposition forces) while brutal repression and raids on civilian areas led by forces loyal to the Assad regime have continued.  It is estimated that more than a thousand people have now lost their lives since 12 April, despite both sides to the conflict agreeing to a cessation of violence and of offensive operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">I call upon the Syrian authorities as well as the armed opposition to desist immediately from these despicable acts of violence and to comply fully with all the elements of the six-point peace plan of UN/Arab League Joint Special Envoy Annan.  In particular, the Assad regime must ensure the complete withdrawal of heavy weaponry and troops from population centres, the release of political detainees and full access for humanitarian assistance organisations.  All sides, including opposition forces, must halt the violence if the ceasefire is to have any chance of taking hold.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">The current situation in Syria was extensively discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 May which I attended.  The Council recalled its full support to the Annan six-point plan, which remains the only realistic and agreed framework to bring an end to the violence and to promote a peaceful political transition in Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">The Council also welcomed the deployment of the UN Supervision Mission (UNSMIS), as authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2043.  This is a central element in the efforts towards achieving a complete and durable cessation of violence.  Ireland is contributing a contingent of six military observers to the Mission, as per the Government decision of 24 April.  The Irish contingent is now fully deployed in Syria and has joined the approximately 200 other military observers and 65 civilian staff of the 300-strong Mission already on site.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">Recent attacks targeting UNSMIS personnel, such as that outside Deraa on 9 May and the attack on a convoy of four cars carrying UNSMIS observers near the city of Hama on 14 May, serve as stark reminders of the severity of the challenges faced by the Mission in fulfilling its mandate.  Ireland, along with its EU partners, reiterates its call to the Syrian authorities to ensure the safety of the observers and to facilitate the full and prompt deployment of UNSMIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">The humanitarian situation remains critical.  Over 50,000 Syrians have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries and many civilians inside Syria are in need of sanitation, food and medical aid.  Ireland is working closely with the UN and other international partners to address this situation and we urge the Syrian authorities to facilitate the delivery of aid, rather than continuously hindering the efforts of humanitarian organisations to speed up the provision of essential relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">I very much regret the postponement of the Arab League-sponsored meeting scheduled for 16 May in Cairo whose objective was to build greater unity among the Syrian opposition. The international community has been quite clear that it will only engage with and support those opposition groupings committed to democratic values and a peaceful political transition in Syria. All such opposition parties, both inside and outside Syria, must make greater efforts to unite and work towards a much-needed common platform of values, reflective of the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian people, with a view to engaging swiftly in a genuine and inclusive process of political transition, as provided for under the Annan Plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">On 19 April 2012, our Ambassador to South Africa presented his letter of appointment to the President of Zimbabwe. The formal presentation ceremony follows a strict protocol with the Head of State leading the conversation.  The issue of human rights did therefore not arise in the course of President Mugabe's conversation with our Ambassador.  However, Ireland's concerns on human rights have been consistently made clear to the Zimbabwean authorities and our Ambassador will continue to do so when he visits that country. The Zimbabwean authorities are aware that Ireland fully subscribes to the EU position on Zimbabwe.  Since 2008, when violence broke out during the elections in Zimbabwe, the EU has implemented targeted restrictive measures against specified individuals and entities.  These measures are a clear statement of our continuing concern at the state of human rights in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">At present, a reform process is underway in Zimbabwe which should lead to a revised constitution, reform of the electoral laws and the holding of elections within the coming months.  The countries of the Southern African region, and notably South Africa, are playing the leading role in working with the parties in Zimbabwe to facilitate these steps, and the EU and the wider international community are supporting the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">Ireland, both directly and through the EU, is working to respond to the development needs of the people of Zimbabwe.  Since 2002, the EU has suspended support to the Government of Zimbabwe because of its failure to fulfil commitments on democracy and human rights.  My Department, through Irish Aid, funds a programme of support to civil society, humanitarian assistance and people living with HIV in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p eId="para_2180">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for two Votes — Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 27 (International Cooperation).  I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on all consultant expenditure and commissioning of such work is in full compliance with national and EU procurement regulations.  The Department, through Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), occasionally commissions outside expertise where the effective management, evaluation and review of the programme necessitates the use of such skills. Elements of the aid programme are highly technical such as the areas of HIV-AIDS, communicable diseases, nutrition, agriculture and others. It is essential if the aid programme is to remain at the cutting edge of development science that it utilises outside expertise from time to time for quality assurance and to provide access to the latest knowledge. Utilising external expertise on a temporary basis can also provide excellent value for money as the skills involved are only utilised on a needs rather than full-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">Consultants are engaged only where specialised knowledge and skills are not available within the Department and where independent appraisal, audit, monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects are required.  Decisions on the need to commission outside expertise are subject to the establishment of appropriate business cases and an approvals process carried out by the Irish Aid Senior Management Group. National and international regulations are fully complied with in subsequent tendering processes.  The level of expenditure on consultancy services is constantly monitored to ensure that it does not exceed the level required for the proper management, oversight, monitoring, evaluation and audit of the aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The following tables set out the details of consultants engaged by the Department in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the names of consultants engaged in each year and show the significant reduction in contracts sought since 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2470">I take it that the Deputy is referring to a meeting on adoption legislation which was jointly organised by the Kazakh Ministry of Education and Science and UNICEF on Friday 11 May in Astana.  We understand that the purpose of the event was to inform Embassy representatives of updates in relation to Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.  Ireland did not receive such an invitation; it was not in any case in a position to be represented at the meeting for scheduling/resource reasons.  The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow, which is accredited to Kazakhstan, met with an official of the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 11 May and expressed Ireland's strong interest in exploring the possibilities for inter-country adoption from Kazakhstan.  This is an issue which I understand the Adoption Authority of Ireland is currently examining. The Embassy representative took the opportunity to convey to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during this meeting copies of letters, with an Embassy Russian translation, which had been sent to the Ministry of Education and Science by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The Embassy representative requested that these be forwarded to that Ministry for attention and also indicated Ireland's willingness to develop direct contacts with the Ministry of Education and Science as well as the Embassy's willingness to meet with such representatives during future visits to Astana.  The representative also requested that Ireland be added to the invitation list for any future such events so that consideration of Irish participation could be considered in a timely fashion.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_2472">The Government's aid programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is sharply focused on the fight against global poverty and hunger.  It is recognised internationally for its effectiveness, and for its concentration on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">Irish Aid channels a higher proportion of overall assistance through development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) than other international donors, reflecting the strong support of the Irish people for the work of NGOs and missionaries.  This assistance is provided to support the long term development and humanitarian work of NGOs, in accordance with the objectives of the Government's aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">This partnership between Irish Aid and NGOs is strategically directed to ensure that aid reaches those for whom it is intended with a particular focus on the poorest and most vulnerable communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  Irish Aid has established strict eligibility criteria to determine which NGOs are eligible to apply for significant grant funding.  The main eligibility criteria include a proven organisational capacity for the effective use of funding and a solid track record of delivery.  All proposals for funding from NGOs are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources.  This appraisal process ensures that Irish Aid funding is directed towards those partners with the capacity to deliver in the fight against global hunger and poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">NGO programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure the intended objectives and goals are being accomplished.  All programmes are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Unit's work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">The most recent international report on development assistance, the 2010 Survey of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, ranked Ireland highest among EU Member States for the delivery of our commitments on aid quality. Our NGO partners play a crucial role as we strive to achieve the maximum benefit from Ireland's development co-operation programme and its contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2477">I believe our continued focus on appraisal, regular monitoring, independent evaluations and audit provides assurance that those funds channelled though NGOs are very closely monitored and used for the purposes intended.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2480">I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">The Government, along with our EU partners, attach high importance to the development of relations with the countries of Africa, to supporting economic and social development and to responding to the effects of conflict and natural disasters on that continent.  Our national approach is guided by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which I launched in September 2011.  It sets out a framework for our policies in the political, development and economic areas in order to ensure that our engagement is as coherent and effective as possible.  A fundamental principle of our approach is an emphasis on the promotion of political progress including the resolution of conflict, the strengthening of democracy, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to work with African Governments, African regional organisations, communities in the priority countries for our aid programme, the UN, and humanitarian organisations to address the causes of conflict, instability and famine and food insecurity in Africa.  We are also active in responding to the consequences of these problems, including the displacement of civilians and the humanitarian needs of affected people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">The EU has adopted comprehensive strategies to address the complex problems in the Horn of Africa and Sahel regions. In the case of the Horn of Africa region, the challenges faced in the region are immense, given the context of international and ethnic conflict, the issues of terrorism and piracy, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and the plight of an estimated 13 million people in need of emergency assistance.  We are particularly focused on the ongoing crisis in southern Somalia, where famine was declared last year in six areas of the country and where access for humanitarian aid agencies remains a major challenge, most especially in areas controlled by the Islamist group, Al-Shabaab.</p>
            <p eId="para_2484">The EU's Strategic Framework on the Horn of Africa, which was adopted in November 2011, recognises the importance of a stable peace and respect for human rights, and the longer term need for economic and social development across the region. The EU and its Member States recognise that instability in the region poses a growing challenge not only to the security of its peoples but also to the rest of the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">The EU is continuing to play a major role in support of the strengthening of the African Union Peacekeeping Mission in Somalia, increased regional and international efforts on the political transition process, and the combating of piracy and terrorism. The EU has appointed a Special Representative who, in close consultation with the EU Special Representative for Sudan and South Sudan, will help ensure coherence, impact and visibility for the Union's regional approach to the interrelated challenges facing the people of the Horn of Africa.  Ireland recognises that a military and security approach can only have limited success in addressing the crisis in Somalia and the wider region, and we are strongly supportive of a comprehensive regional approach by the EU and the wider international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2486">Ireland is also continuing to make a direct and practical contribution to the response to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa.  We have recently announced a further €2 million in funding for humanitarian agencies responding to the situation in Somalia, through the UN Common Humanitarian Fund.  Ireland is also contributing personnel to the EU Training Mission working with the Transitional Federal Government for Somalia, including the Mission's Commander, who is an Irish Army Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2487">The humanitarian situation across the Sahel region of West Africa is now extremely severe, with fifteen million people struggling to obtain enough food to eat.  Ireland has moved quickly to mobilise emergency funding for agencies operating in the region.  An allocation of €5 million has been made available to a range of experienced partners for programmes on the ground for the provision of emergency food assistance and nutritional healthcare.  Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps has also been mobilised, with a number of its expert personnel already working on the ground with UN agencies.  Irish Aid's key Irish humanitarian NGO partners have been invited to submit proposals for additional funding. On this basis, a further announcement of support may be made in the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">The EU and its Member States are also playing a significant role in addressing fragility, post-conflict rehabilitation, support for electoral processes, peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, capacity-strengthening in the areas of justice and human rights, humanitarian response, and economic and social development, including through support for civil society, in a wide range of African countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2489">Africa is the geographic focus for Ireland's development aid programme, with up to 80% of the aid budget devoted to the objective of ending extreme poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  We also regularly support and contribute personnel for EU Election Observer Missions, including recent missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Senegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2490">Ireland also strongly supports international human rights institutions focusing on Africa, including the International Criminal Court, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_2493">I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">Export-led growth is crucial for a small open economy like Ireland. The Government's Trade Strategy, formulated with the involvement of all the relevant Departments and State Agencies, seeks to build on our strengths in existing markets and to develop new opportunities in emerging economies. The Deputy will be aware that I established the Export Trade Council last year to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and that the membership includes Ministers, State Agencies and Departments responsible for trade, tourism and investment, as well as participants from the private sector.  Under the Strategy, twenty seven priority market countries have been identified by the State Agencies in both established and emerging markets and there is a resident Embassy of Ireland in each of these.  Our Ambassadors in these markets chair a local market team, with the involvement of the relevant State Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">Emerging markets such as the BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — are, of course, priorities under the Government's Trade Strategy in seeking to develop new trading opportunities. We are already increasing our trade foot print in these markets. In the five years between 2006 and 2011 our Merchandise Exports to them have increased by 66%. During 2012, under the programme of Enterprise Ireland trade missions agreed by Minister Bruton and myself, each of these markets is being targeted. As the Deputy will be aware the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers have already visited China this year.  In addition to the BRICS countries, there is also a focus on other key emerging markets. For example, in March the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello TD, led an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Turkey, involving a range of Irish companies, with the full support of the resident Embassy of Ireland in Ankara.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">Our Embassy network is engaged on a continuous basis, and in close co-operation with the relevant State Agencies, in the drive to promote Ireland's economic reputation and trade. It is widely recognised as a very effective platform for accessing key political, economic and media contacts and business opportunities.  The opening of an Embassy in the United Arab Emirates in 2009, to serve the crucial Gulf region alongside our existing Embassy in Saudi Arabia, and a new Consulate in Atlanta in 2011 was very much driven by economic and trading factors. Under the Government's Trade Strategy, all Government Departments and State Agencies are committed to monitoring the export environment and to deploying resources where they can have maximum impact in boosting Ireland's export growth.  It would, of course, be desirable to open an Embassy of Ireland in a number of additional markets but this will have to await the availability of the necessary resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2498">Ireland and its European Union partners monitor closely the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world, including in the Middle East.  We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  We make known our concerns about particular violations of human rights to the Governments in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">Ireland endorses the use of the full United Nations human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.   This includes supporting the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  At the UN, the EU makes statements on the human rights situations in countries around the world;  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts regular dialogues with a number of countries and raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">At a bilateral level, officials in my Department engage in ongoing dialogue with Embassies here in Dublin and abroad to raise my concerns about specific cases, especially cases of persons who have been detained without due process or suffered mistreatment while in detention. Ireland also actively engages in the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review process in Geneva to address specific concerns and make recommendations to the country under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">Ireland promotes full observance of universal human rights standards.  Our active participation in multilateral organisations, including the EU and the UN, provides us with an opportunity to voice our concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights.   We will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering the protection of human rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_2504">All the countries of the Western Balkans were given a European perspective and their path to EU integration was confirmed as far back as the EU–Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki in 2003. The Summit Declaration also committed the EU to supporting the endeavours of the countries of the region to consolidate democracy, stability and to promote economic development. As the countries of the region continue to make progress in the realisation of their European perspective Ireland has been, and continues to be, fully supportive of their efforts in this regard and we work closely with our EU and international partners, including the UN, as well as the countries themselves in achieving this objective.    I will give a few specific examples of this continued focus on the Western Balkans, particularly as regards protecting democracy and democratic structures to illustrate the point.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">Starting with Albania, since the political agreement between the government and opposition was reached in November 2011, we have seen real efforts being made by both political sides to take reforms forward. There has been a significant expression of cross-party commitment to the EU, and democracy, agenda.   An Action Plan was agreed in March to address the key priorities in the Commission's Opinion on Albania's application for EU membership, and the results are encouraging, including in the area of rule of law and fundamental rights. If progress continues I would hope to see Albania become an official candidate for EU accession in the near future.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Vjekoslav Bevanda, has shown commitment to resolving the outstanding issues which have prevented the EU-Bosnia Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) from entering into force, including giving effect to the Sejdic-Finci judgement. Delivering on these commitments will remain a challenge, but I firmly believe that they can be achieved. The UN High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Valentin Inzko, spoke about a "prevailing positive trend" in Bosnia towards Euro-Atlantic integration in his recent six-monthly report to the UN Security Council on the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords. I would certainly echo these sentiments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">The successful and peaceful conduct of the recent local, parliamentary and Presidential elections in Serbia is testament to the strength of the democratic institutions there. The election results saw a democratic endorsement for Serbia's determination to pursue European integration. Once a new government has been formed, I look forward to Serbia's continued progress on the path to EU accession.   This is not to say that further work and commitment is not required by Serbia, in particular with regard to its relations with Kosovo, but its advances are highly encouraging.  In Kosovo, eligible voters were given the opportunity to vote in the Serbian parliamentary and presidential elections after agreement was reached to allow the OSCE to conduct ballot facilitation in Kosovo <i>.</i> As Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE,   Ireland played a significant role in brokering the agreement between Kosovo and Serbia and encouraging local actors to play a responsible role.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">The endorsement by the March European Council of the launch of a feasibility study regarding an EU-Kosovo SAA by the Commission is a positive step in the EU's tangible support for Kosovo and its EU aspirations. Pristina has demonstrated determination to implement the significant reforms required to progress its European integration objectives and Ireland, as is the case for all the countries of the Western Balkans, will continue to support Kosovo in achieving these reforms.  In March this year, the European Commission launched a High Level Accession Dialogue (HLAD) with Macedonia. The HLAD places EU integration back at the forefront of the domestic agenda in Skopje and has reignited momentum towards achieving the necessary reforms required. The HLAD does not replace the accession negotiations, but rather places way markers to them.  Finally, a decision on whether to open accession negotiations with Montenegro will be taken at the June European Council.  I believe that Montenegro has done what was asked of it, including in the area of rule of law, and I hope that accession negotiations will be well underway when we take over the EU Presidency in 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2509">Neither Ireland nor, as far as I am aware, the European Union or the United Nations maintains a "top ten" list of countries in regard to the violations highlighted by the Deputy.   In our foreign policy, which is expressed in direct contact with other countries or multilaterally through the EU, the UN, and other international bodies such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (chaired this year by Ireland), we are working to alleviate incidences of war, terror, human rights or other abuses, and to enhance international peace and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">Together with its EU partners, Ireland monitors closely the situation in many countries, including post-conflict countries, throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including official channels, National Human Rights Institutions and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  We make known our concerns about particular violations of human rights to the Governments in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts regular dialogues with a number of countries and raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">Ireland endorses the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.   This includes supporting the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. To complement this, the UN Human Rights Council has established a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) which assesses the human rights record of all UN Member States. At the UN, the EU makes statements on the human rights situations in countries around the world.  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">Ireland promotes full observance of universal human rights standards.   Our active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU and the UN provides us with an opportunity to voice our concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights. Ireland will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering the protection of human rights. We will also, through our official aid programme, continue to promote human rights and good governance in places of greatest need.</p>

         the extent to which the international community has been able to intervene in Syria in order to protect human rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2516">I have on a number of occasions stated clearly my grave concerns at the appalling situation in Syria.  I have repeatedly condemned the unacceptable human rights violations and repression which are now estimated to have claimed well over 10,000 lives since the conflict first erupted in March 2011.   While there was some brief improvement in the situation following the coming into effect of the April 12 ceasefire, this regrettably has not been sustained and recent days have unfortunately seen a resurgence in the number of attacks, shelling of towns and deadly bombings, resulting in further heavy loss of lives among combatants and civilians.   There is no doubting the widespread international revulsion generated by the conflict over the last 14 months and in particular by the violence and killings associated with the repressive actions of the Syrian regime. The international community has been prompt to express its indignation and to compel the Syrian regime to change course, notably through the adoption by an overwhelming majority of a UN General Assembly Resolution on 16 February which  condemned human rights violations in Syria and a UN Human Rights Council Resolution, adopted on 23 March, on the human rights situation in Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">The UN Human Rights Council has also initiated a process of inquiry through the establishment last August of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry.  Mandated to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Syria since the beginning of the conflict, and, where possible, to identify those responsible, the Commission, in its 23 February 2012 report, found that there has been a systemic impunity for human rights violations in Syria since March 2011.   It also reported that Syrian state forces are suspected of having committed widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity, with the knowledge and consent of President Assad and senior members of his regime. The Commission is expected to publish a further report in the course of next month which may well pave the way for possible consideration by the UN Security Council of referral to the International Criminal Court for those suspected of involvement in serious human rights violations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">The European Union has, of course, also reacted to the violence in Syria.   It has adopted a series of robust economic, political and diplomatic measures to compel the Syrian regime to cease its reprehensible attacks against the Syrian people.   While actively supporting the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Envoy Kofi Annan to negotiate a ceasefire and mediate a peaceful settlement, the EU has also imposed several rounds of tough sanctions targeted on the Assad regime and those who support the repression.  Last week's Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended, reiterated the EU's readiness to impose further sanctions and to step up the pressure on the Syrian regime as long as the violence and human rights abuses continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">In saying all this, we must also be realistic about what the international community can accomplish in relation to the current situation in Syria.  The absolute imperative must be to try to prevent Syria from slipping further into open civil war.   It is crucial that both the Syrian authorities and the opposition forces abide by the ceasefire they committed to observe under Special Envoy Annan's six-point plan.  In this regard, we must continue supporting the work of the Supervision Mission (UNSMIS), established by UN Security Council Resolution 2043, and of its observers who are gradually being deployed throughout the country and who are carrying out their duties in very difficult conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">Ultimately, the complete cessation of violence and implementation of the Annan Plan in full offer the best opportunity for ending the conflict and ongoing human rights violations and setting in train a process of urgently needed political reform and transition in Syria.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work steadfastly in support of this aim.</p>

The individual is required to take up full-time employment with the company and to hold at least 15% of the issued ordinary share capital for the required period, which is usually three years.

            <p eId="para_2551">Sections 472A and 88A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide tax incentives for both employers and employees, to help the long-term unemployed to return to employment.   The relief under Section 472A, known as the Revenue Job Assist scheme, allows qualifying employees, in addition to their normal tax credits, to claim certain income deductions, including additional deductions for qualifying children, for the three year period after taking up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">Section 88A provides an associated tax incentive for employers. Employers may claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first 3 years wages paid to qualifying employees. This double deduction may also be claimed in respect of the employers PRSI contribution on such wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_2553">For example, if an employer provided employment to an individual earning €20,000, the employers PRSI would amount to €2,150. When computing the profits for corporation tax purposes, the employer can deduct double the amount of salary and employers PRSI paid in respect of that individual, i.e. an additional €22,150, which would result in a reduced liability to corporation tax saving the company €2,768.75 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2554">Both incentives apply in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2555">The latest year for which information is available on the take-up of the scheme is for 2009, when 200 employers and 390 employees participated, at a cost to the Exchequer of €0.3 million. Full details of the scheme for employees can be found in Revenue leaflet IT58 and for employers in Revenue leaflet IT59. These leaflets, along with a recently published guide entitled <i>Supporting Job Creation — Tax reliefs, deductions and exemptions,</i> are available on the Revenue Commissioners website at <i>http://www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2556">In addition, the Department of Social Protection provides for the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme. Under this scheme, if an employer takes on an additional member of staff in 2012 that has been unemployed for 6 months or more, an exemption from employers' PRSI for 18 months is available. Primary responsibility for this incentive rests with the Minister for Social Protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_2568">The position is that family members employed in a family business are taxed at the same rate of tax as non-family members.   Therefore, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the disallowance of the employee tax credit (more commonly known as the PAYE tax credit) to a spouse and some children in respect of the PAYE tax due on their income from employment in a family business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 472 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a tax credit known as the "employee tax credit" to an individual who has emoluments to which the PAYE system of tax deduction at source applies.  However, the section prohibits the granting of this tax credit against the PAYE tax due on income from a family business payable to the spouse of a proprietary director (where the family business is conducted through a limited company) or payable to the spouse of a sole trader (where the family business is conducted as a sole trade).</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">While the same prohibition applies to income payable to the children of a proprietary director or of a sole trader, I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners there are circumstances  wherein such children (provided they themselves are not proprietary directors of the family business) may be entitled to the PAYE tax credit against the PAYE tax due on income from a family business.   Such circumstances are—</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">(a) (i)     the son or daughter is what is known as a specified employed PRSI contributor for the purposes of the  Social Welfare Acts, or</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2572">(ii) the PAYE and Universal Social Charge systems have been applied in full to the  wages paid to the son or daughter;</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">(b)  the terms of the employment are such as to constitute a full-time employment and the individual actually engages in the employment on a full-time basis (i.e. the son or daughter must throughout the relevant tax year devote substantially the whole of his/her time to the employment (this rules out children engaged on a part-time or temporary basis); and</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_487">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2577">The Government has brought forward a number of improvements to incentives designed to help businesses retain staff and take on new employees over the past year. These include the measures set out as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) and Seed Capital Scheme commenced on 25 November 2011 following the receipt of State aid approval from the European Commission. These schemes replace the previous Business Expansion Scheme and Seed Capital Scheme and provide tax relief for investments in small and medium-sized enterprises. Under the EII, an initial 30% tax relief is available to investors with the potential for a further 11% relief at the end of the three year holding period, where the company has increased employment or spent at least 30% of the funding raised on research and development. The new schemes provide relief for investments in companies operating in most sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">Tax relief is also available for start-up companies. This scheme was introduced in Budget 2009 and provides relief from corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies in the first three years of trading, and was modified in 2011 so that the value of the relief will be linked to the amount of employers PRSI paid by a company. Finance Act 2012 extended this scheme for the next three years to include start-up companies which commence a new trade in 2012, 2013 or 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">The Revenue Job Assist scheme is available to all employers who employ qualifying individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months. This scheme provides a double deduction from Income Tax and PRSI for employers. A deduction from Income Tax is also available for the employee. This scheme was extended in Finance Act 2012 such that individuals who are signing for PRSI credits can also qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">All companies in receipt of the R&amp;D tax credit now have the option to use a portion of the credit to reward key employees who have been directly involved in the development of R&amp;D. This option was introduced in order to help companies to retain key employees. It is envisaged that there would be no additional cost to the Exchequer as the bonus comes from the R&amp;D credit already received by the company and the employee still pays the full tax liability on their other income. This change will be monitored closely and if abused will be removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2582">The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provided for a second reduced VAT rate of 9% on a temporary basis in respect of certain tourism-related services and goods for the period 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2013.  This measure is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  Initial analysis of the effectiveness of the 9% VAT rate indicates that employment numbers in the tourism and restaurant sector have increased, prices have reduced and Tourism Ireland is targeting growth in overseas visitor numbers in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2583">In addition, the Department of Social Protection provides for the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme. Under this scheme, if an employer takes on an additional member of staff in 2012 that has been unemployed for 6 months or more, an exemption from employers' PRSI for 18 months is available. Primary responsibility for this incentive rests with the Minister for Social Protection.</p>

While the global survey showed that trading activity in the OTC interest rate derivatives market increased by 24 per cent since the last survey in 2007, this represented a slowing of the rapid growth seen over the previous four surveys.  The survey found that in Ireland, the increase in trading in OTC interest-rate derivatives between April 2007 and April 2010 was 6.6 per cent.  Trading activity in these instruments increased marginally Ireland since the last survey in 2007, but average daily turnover actually declined, from €5.4 billion in April 2007 to €5.2 billion in April 2010.

            <p eId="para_2617">The Foreign Account Tax Compliant Act (FATCA), which is part of the US Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010, aims to combat tax evasion by US tax residents using foreign accounts.  It includes certain provisions on withholding taxes and on the reporting of information by foreign financial institutions for US tax compliance purposes.  It will come into effect from January 2013.  In order to address the possible administrative burden which might arise for EU financial institutions as well as possible breaches of EU Data Protection legislation, the Governments of a number of Member States, with the support of the European Commission, took part in joint discussions with the US authorities to explore a practical way forward that supports the overall aim to combat tax evasion, while reducing the risks and burdens on EU financial institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">The approach focuses on the use of existing tax treaties for information exchange between tax authorities, rather than direct reporting by EU financial institutions to the US Internal Revenue Service. The US is preparing a model global agreement upon which reporting to the US by FATCA partner countries will be based.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have been in contact with their counterparts in the US to explore the implementation of FATCA rules through the global approach being devised by the US.  There are at this point no specific concerns for the State with regard to the US proposals.  However, the burden on financial institutions will be reduced where countries enter into an agreement with the U.S., based on the global agreement. The global model agreement is expected to be available before the end of June this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2622">On 27 March 2012 while presenting the OECD's Economic Surveys of the Euro Area and the European Union in Brussels, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said the Euro Area Finance Ministers meeting, taking place that week, needed to boost the firepower of the European stability funds to at least one trillion euros. He said that a credible financial firewall would provide governments with the breathing space they needed to focus crucially on revitalising Europe's economic growth and competitiveness.  In order to further improve market confidence and in accordance with the agreement reached at the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) meeting on 9 December 2011 and reiterated on 2 March 2012, the HoSG have reassessed the adequacy of the overall EFSF/ESM lending ceiling of €500 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2623">The Eurogroup concluded its review of the ESM capacity on 30 March and agreed in principle the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2624">That the ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012.  The EFSF will, as a rule, only remain active in financing programmes that have started before that date.  For a transitional period until mid-2013, it may engage in new programmes in order to ensure a full fresh lending capacity of €500 billion.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2625">The current overall ceiling for ESM/EFSF lending, as defined in the ESM Treaty, will be raised to €700 billion such that the ESM and the EFSF will be able to operate, if needed, as described above.  As of mid-2013, the maximum lending volume of ESM will be €500 billion.  The combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the EFSF will continue to be set at €700 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2626">In addition €49 billion out of the EFSM and €53 billion out of the bilateral Greek loan facility have already been paid out to support current programme countries.  All together the euro area is mobilising an overall firewall of approximately €800 billion, equivalent to over $1 trillion.  On 2 April, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría welcomed the measures announced by Eurogroup Finance Ministers meeting in Copenhagen to protect the euro area economies.</p>

         if he will provide, in tabular form, the amount that could be raised annually for the Exchequer if a wealth tax following the model of Switzerland, France, Norway, Canada and Luxemburg were to be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [25100/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2628">Of the five "wealth taxes" mentioned by the Deputy, three — those in France, Norway and Switzerland — are wealth taxes as normally understood, that is, an annual recurring tax on wealth.  To estimate the potential revenue from such a wealth tax, we would need to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the CSO institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  So while the CSO's institutional sector accounts show that households held c. €126 billion on deposit in 2010, this is not broken down by income or wealth categories.  However, I understand that, following discussions between the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced a "Household Finance and Consumption Survey", which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, a survey of wealth.  The first results of this survey will be available in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2629">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential annually recurring tax on wealth.  It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy on the potential return from implementing a wealth tax system based on the models operating in France, Norway and Switzerland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2630">Luxembourg abolished its wealth tax on individuals in 2006 but still has a "net wealth tax" on companies, which is at 0.5% on the company's net assets — the assets of the company less debts — in the balance sheet at the end of the accounting period.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Corporation Tax returns do not require the value of company assets to be recorded so it is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential yield should such a tax be introduced in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2631">The only "wealth tax" among those listed by the Deputy where it is possible to make an estimate of the potential yield if a similar measure was introduced here is the newly introduced tax in the Province of Ontario in Canada.  This is an income tax rather than a tax on wealth, as it applies to the portion of an individual's income in excess of CN$500,000 in a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2632">The full year yield to the Exchequer from implementing a system on similar lines, where an additional tax of 3.12% would be applied to the excess of incomes above a threshold of €388,000 (the approximate equivalent of the Canadian threshold of CN$500,000), would be of the order of €73 million by reference to projected incomes for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2633">The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.  The figure is, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.  This potential yield may also be subject to significant behavioural effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2634">Asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances they may have declined considerably in many cases. Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual's wealth is measured at a particular time there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual's wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.  This would make it difficult to predict the potential yield from a wealth tax — and this would have to be borne in mind in terms of its consistency as a source of revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2635">Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  However, they are not annual taxes on an individual's wealth.  The rate of both these taxes is currently 30%, which I increased from 25% in Budget 2012.  I also reduced the CAT group tax-free threshold for gifts/inheritances from parents to children (the Group A threshold) from €332,084 to €250,000.  The introduction of wealth taxes similar to those referred to by the Deputy could have a negative impact on receipts from CGT and CAT.  The overall net revenue result cannot therefore be estimated with any certainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_2656">I have no function in respect of the sale of private property by the National Asset Management Agency.   NAMA has not disposed of any property directly itself.  The NAMA Board has issued guidelines to be followed by its debtors and receivers in terms of the disposal of assets, which require, wherever feasible, their sale on the open market and their public advertisement.   In any event, NAMA requires that an independent valuation process be undertaken in respect of all asset disposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2657">In relation to the particular transaction to which the Deputy refers, I would draw the Deputy's attention to my response to a recent Parliamentary Question from Deputy McGrath [22511/12] in relation to the sale of land controlled by NAMA debtors in Cork.  In that particular instance, NAMA advised me that the sales agent was acting on behalf of the debtor and that a competitive sales process was undertaken.  The debtor was not in liquidation.  I understand from NAMA that the sale was managed and implemented on behalf of the debtor by a firm of professional sales agents.  Following wide engagement with viable interested parties, a special purchaser emerged in respect of the entire holding of 450 acres at a price considerably in excess of that guided by the retained professionals.  It was the considered advice of the sales agent that the offer from this purchaser would be accepted.  I further understand that NAMA, on receipt of this information, commissioned a second independent report by another professional firm, which agreed with the original guide price.  On the basis of this independent valuation advice, which established that the price offered was 40% in excess of the 2 independent valuations and taking account of the fact that the offer was for the entire holding rather than for individual land plots within it, NAMA granted its approval to the debtor to proceed with the sale on the advised terms on the basis that this maximised the recovery for the taxpayer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2659">What the analysis referred to by the Deputy shows is that on the basis of certain assumptions, including regarding the deficit in the public finances and nominal economic growth rates, the debt-to-GDP ratio could converge to a low level in the long-run.  The analysis referred to by the Deputy is a technical, mathematical analysis.  In it, it is assumed that nominal GDP grows at 4 per cent per annum and that the average deficit in the public finances is 1 per cent of GDP.  On the basis of these assumptions and the application of a technical mathematical formula, it is possible to see how the debt-to-GDP ratio could converge to 25 per cent in the long-run.  That said, it would also be possible to arrive at a very different long-run debt-to-GDP ratio using different assumptions.  Compliance with the Stability Treaty does not require an equilibrium debt-to-GDP ratio of 20 to 25 per cent.</p>

            <p eId="para_2666">The annual turnover threshold for VAT registration depends on the nature of the business carried on.  In general, there are two thresholds: the goods threshold, which is currently €75,000, and the services threshold, which is €37,500.  Where 90 per cent or more of the turnover of a person or company consists of the supply of taxable goods, that person or company must register and account for VAT on sales if the total annual turnover of the business exceeds the goods threshold.  I would point out that the goods threshold of €75,000 is third highest threshold in the EU with the majority of EU Member States having thresholds below €30,000.   Some Member States do not operate any VAT registration threshold, requiring all businesses to register.</p>
            <p eId="para_2667">Registration thresholds reduce the administrative burden on both small businesses, often at the developmental stage, and on Revenue authorities.  However, registration thresholds are not intended as a means of keeping small businesses permanently outside the VAT system.  Therefore in setting registration thresholds levels, the objective is to strike an appropriate balance between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the Revenue authorities and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions relative to registered firms.</p>

            <p eId="para_2671">Section 480A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for relief from income tax on retirement for certain income of certain sportspersons.  The sportspersons who qualify are: athletes, badminton players, boxers, cricketers, cyclists, footballers, golfers, jockeys, motor racing drivers, rugby players, squash players, swimmers and tennis players.  The earnings to which the relief applies are earnings from participation in the relevant sport such as prize money, performance fees etc., but not other earnings such as sponsorship fees, advertisement income or income from endorsements.  The relief takes the form of a deduction from the sportsperson's participation earnings of an amount equal to 40 per cent of those earnings for any 10 tax years for which the sportsperson was resident in the State, starting with the tax year 1990/91.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">The relief is given by way of repayment of tax and is to be claimed within four years from the end of the tax year in which the sportsperson ceases permanently to be engaged in that sport provided he or she is resident in the State in that year.  The relief is withdrawn if the person subsequently recommences in that sport, though this does not prevent a further claim for the relief if and when the sportsperson finally retires at a later time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2673">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost to the Exchequer of the tax relief on retirement for qualifying sportspersons is set out in the following table for the tax years 2005 to 2009 inclusive.  2009 is the latest year for which the necessary detailed data is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2688">The position is that changes included in Finance (No. 3) Act 2011 arising from the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 gave effect to specific provisions in relation to the taxation of civil partners under which they can elect to be jointly or separately assessed to tax or indeed to continue to be treated as single persons.  It also allows for the transfer of tax credits between civil partners.  The Finance (No. 3) Act 2011 also provided for a new scheme of tax relief for court ordered maintenance payments and asset transfers to a former financially dependent cohabitant, subsequent to the break-up of a cohabiting relationship.  This also arose from the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  However, apart from that, cohabitating couples are not recognised for the purposes of income tax law and they have no entitlement to transfer tax credits or tax bands between themselves.  The civil partnership legislation and the subsequent tax legislation made no changes in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2690">The aim of the Department of Social Protection in means testing for job seeker's allowance individuals who are seeking employment is not the same as the Revenue Commissioners in administering tax credits which are available for offset against liability to income tax on earnings.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. the Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p>
            <p eId="para_2691">The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the granting of tax credits based on the civil status of the claimant.  A person who is single is entitled to a basic personal credit of €1,650 and this is doubled to €3,300 for a married couple or civil partners who are jointly assessed.  Should the couple choose separate treatment or single assessment, each individual is entitled to a personal credit of €1,650.  Married couples or civil partners can transfer tax credits and tax bands between the individuals, and this is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less that the 20% tax threshold of €32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.</p>
            <p eId="para_2692">A cohabiting couple where both partners are working also get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. €3,300).  However, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of income tax and, accordingly, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2754">I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 to 236, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the period 2011-2014.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The banks provide my Department and the CRO with monthly returns outlining their SME lending figures, broken down at a sectoral and regional level. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was €3.1 billion in 2011. For the Deputy's information, the relevant statistics for credit made available to small business are accessible at: <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Documents/ie<u>       </u>Table<u>       </u>A.14.1<u>       </u>Credit<u>       </u>Advanced<u>       </u>to<u>       </u>Irish<u>       </u>Resident<u>       </u>Small<u>       </u>and<u>       </u>Medium<u>       </u>Sized<u>       </u>Enterprises.xls</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2758">In terms of the level of lending to small and medium enterprises that was roll over or extensions to existing loan facilities for 2011, the two pillar banks have provided me with the relevant data but as this material is commercially sensitive I cannot share it with the Deputy.  Neither my Department nor the Central Bank has a breakdown of the level of lending between new and established SMEs in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2759">The Deputy may wish to note that the Central Bank gathers and collates statistics on a wide range of Financial Services Sector activities on an on-going basis. As a general rule, my Department does not engage in a separate exercise to collect such statistics, but has access to and relies on statistics provided and published by the Central Bank.</p>

            <p eId="para_2761">I wish to inform the Deputy that I receive representations on the illicit tobacco trade on an on-going basis. This Government together with the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco, regard the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade as a high priority area. The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multifaceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">The Revenue Commissioners have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans. This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue's website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2764">The Department of the Taoiseach, supported by the Department of Finance, has engaged with the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987 by providing a forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of effort through the mechanism of the IFSC Clearing House Group (CHG) and the related Working Groups. During this period, the IFSC has grown to employ 33,000 people and to contribute over €1 billion annually through corporation tax and payroll taxes. Last year the CHG prepared a <i>Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland 2011-2016 </i>which is framed on the basis of an objective to create more than 10,000 net new jobs, to protect existing employment and business and to consolidate the sector as a key driver of the Irish economy over the next five years. This Strategy has been published and is available on both Departments’ websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">The IFSC Clearing House Group (CHG) is a broadly based forum established to identify and consider issues of major concern to the continued and long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland. It considers issues such as the strategic development of new business opportunities, the progress of relevant legislation and it identifies, from time to time, the need for responsibility to be assigned for overseeing and reporting to the Government on any significant developments or initiatives for the international financial services industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">In the context of Budget and Finance Bill 2012, my Department considered submissions relating to IFSC tax issues from:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2767">CHG Banking and Treasury Working Group — Tax Sub-Group,</p>

            <p eId="para_2772">As the Deputy is aware, the recent Finance Bill contained a package of measures, designed to support the ambitious target of creating 10,000 jobs over the next five years as set out in the new strategy.  In summary, the measures enhance the competitive position of the sector by:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2773">reducing double taxation in the corporate treasury and aircraft leasing sectors,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2774">providing clarity around the tax treatment of complex financial transactions in terms of stamp duty in particular,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2775">addressing tax issues arising for investment funds due to the UCITS*   IV Directive which was implemented on 1 July 2011, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2776">further easing the administrative burden in relation to non-resident investors in Irish investment funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">None of the measures has a significant cost element and the majority are aimed at simplifying the tax treatment applying to complex financial transactions in order to make it easier to do business in Ireland.  In relation specifically to the taxation of special purpose vehicles, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no special rulings or authorisations related to special purpose vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a special purpose vehicle may pay to holders of securities an amount corresponding to the amount of income it derives from the securitised assets. As the purpose of such vehicles is to transfer all the income and risk from securitised assets to the security-holders, payments to security-holders are fully deductible for tax purposes. The vehicle does not realise a profit and no tax liability arises.  No additional tax would accrue to the State if payments to security-holders by the special purpose vehicles were not fully tax deductible, as the securitisation activity would not be located here in the first instance. *UCITS — Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2780">Ireland has currently 66 signed double tax treaties, of which 59 are in effect. The principal purposes of these treaties are, first, to avoid double taxation which would otherwise arise as a result of each of the signatory countries separately taxing the same income or gains without relief for the tax paid in the other country and, second, to assist in preventing tax evasion. In addition, treaties prohibit the imposition of discriminatory tax burdens on Irish citizens and companies by treaty partner countries, on one hand, and on their nationals by Ireland, on the other. Preventing double, or discriminatory, tax burdens is not only important in the case of countries that are already major trading partners but also in facilitating the growth of trade with countries and regions offering new markets for Irish business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2781">The negotiation and agreement of bilateral treaties requires the other country to have the capacity to conduct tax treaty negotiations; to be willing to pursue mutually beneficial outcomes; and, most important, to be agreeable to initiate negotiations in the first instance.  Not all countries, including some with significant domestic markets, pursue an active expansion of their double tax treaty network. For a small open economy, an extensive treaty network is a vital part of the legal infrastructure facilitating external trade. Ireland seeks to progressively reduce the possibility of existing, and potential, trading partners doubly taxing, or discriminating against, Irish individuals or companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">While proposals to revise existing treaties may be made by officials dealing directly with tax matters, the initial approach to propose a new treaty is typically made through diplomatic channels. An extensive double tax treaty network is important for countries that are competing for inward investment and encouraging the expansion of indigenous business beyond relatively small domestic markets — more treaties ensure more tax certainty for enterprises basing operations in Ireland or growing indigenous operations. In seeking to expand the overall treaty network, opportunities to strengthen coverage of specific regions are also pursued. For example, negotiations with 7 middle-eastern countries have been undertaken in recent years. The treaties mentioned in the Deputy's question were negotiated to address regional coverage in the context of the general expansion of the Ireland's treaty network which has been a key business objective for Revenue and my Department in recent years.</p>

         if, in view of the fact that after entering into double tax treaties with other countries, the terms of the appropriate treaty can ensure that income in respect of underlying assets acquired by a special purpose vehicle can be paid to it without any withholding or other taxes, he will explain the way this procedure can provide a significant advantage for Ireland over the use of tax haven jurisdictions.

            <p eId="para_2786">One of the principal purposes of a double tax treaty is to prevent the taxation of the same income in both the countries concerned — typically, as in the case of Ireland's double tax treaties, by the elimination or reduction of withholding taxes. Tax havens are excluded from tax treaty networks.</p>

         the basis on which the interest rate on any lending from the European Stability Mechanism will be calculated pursuant to Article 20 of the ESM Treaty; the reason the Treaty no longer contains explicit figures for the cost of funds, when these had been specified in the July 2011 version of the Treaty; if he sought at any stage to have a specified costs of funds inserted in the Treaty, in order to provide certainty on that matter should Ireland need to avail of the ESM; and if, notwithstanding his stated belief that Ireland will return to the markets for funding at the end of the current programme, his Department has made any estimate of the potential costs of funding under the ESM, by way of contingency planning.

            <p eId="para_2791">I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">As the Deputy will be aware, the original ESM Treaty signed on 11 July 2011 provided a predefined pricing structure for loans.  Subsequently, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed on 21 July 2011 in the context of the agreement on a new programme of support for Greece, to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to lending rates equivalent to those of the Balance of Payments facility close to, without going below, the EFSF funding cost and to lengthen the maturity of future EFSF loans to Greece. The HoSG also agreed that the EFSF lending rates and the maturities agreed upon for Greece would be applied to the EFSF loans for Ireland and Portugal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">On foot of the agreement of the HoSG on 21 July 2012 to lower interest rates and lengthen loan maturities for Greece, Portugal and Ireland and in the context of discussions on the pricing policy to apply to the ESM, it was agreed by Euro Area Member states that the ESM would allow for more flexibility in terms of pricing. In particular, the ESM Treaty, as signed on 2 February 2012, no longer includes an annex with predefined margins on its loans, and only stipulates that when granting stability support, the ESM shall aim to fully cover its financing and operating costs and shall include an appropriate margin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2794">The capital structure of the ESM was designed to ensure that it would receive the highest possible rating, thus ensuring the lowest possible cost of funding. It is not possible to say what the financing costs might be until the ESM goes to the market in due course and it will depend on market circumstances at that time.  Similarly, it is not possible at this stage to say what the operating costs of the ESM will be for the purpose of calculating the pricing of loans to any country that may seek assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2795">In the ESM Treaty, article 5.6(f) provides that the Board of Governors shall decide, by mutual agreement, to the provision of stability support by the ESM, including the economic policy conditionality as stated in the memorandum of understanding referred to in article 13(3), and to establish the choice of instruments and the financial terms and conditions, in accordance with Articles 12 to 18 of the Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2796">The interest rate to be charged is not intended to act as a deterrent. I do not believe that setting a deterrent interest rate would be in the interest of either a programme country or the broader Euro Area or the EU.  Ireland's programme is on track — we are meeting all of our commitments. The question of Ireland accessing the ESM does not arise. Notwithstanding current uncertainty, it remains the case that we aim to return to the financial markets gradually, to ensure our successful emergence from the programme and on that basis the ESM is a helpful backstop.</p>

            <p eId="para_2866">This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  On that basis I am advised by Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned is not currently receiving mortgage interest relief.  If the person concerned has a secured loan, used to purchase, repair, develop or improve his principal private residence, then he may qualify for mortgage interest relief.  The person must register for the relief so that Revenue Commissioners can, on the basis of the information he will be asked to provide, determine eligibility. To register, the person in question must complete and submit an application on-line at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  Should he have any difficulty in completing the on-line application, he should contact the appropriate Revenue help line at 1890 46 36 26.</p>

            <p eId="para_2868">The Finance Act 2009 provided for a reduction from 1 July 2009 of the rate of interest applied to late payment of tax. In the case of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisition Tax, and Stamp Duty, the daily rate of interest was reduced from 0.0273% to 0.0219%, in effect an annual equivalent drop from 10 % to 8%. In the case of fiduciary taxes, e.g. VAT, PAYE/PRSI and Relevant Contracts Tax the daily rate was reduced from 0.0322 to 0.0274%, in effect an annual equivalent drop from 12% to 10%.  The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer. Where businesses or individuals fail to meet their tax payment obligations on time, then they are liable to interest, as provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act.  Interest on late payment of tax operates not only as a compensation for the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due to it but also as an essential support for timely voluntary compliance by ensuring a level playing field between those who meet their obligations on time and those who pay late or who may attempt not to pay at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_2869">I am satisfied that the current regime as regards interest on late payment of taxes and duties, both the legislative basis and the administrative processes operated by Revenue, achieves the correct balance in supporting timely compliance and securing the revenues due to the Exchequer on a timely basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2871">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of expenditure on consultancy in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the details requested are set out in the following tables.  In accordance with "Guidelines on the Engagement of Consultants and other External Support" issued by the Department of Finance, consultant support is procured only where it is necessary and value for money is obtained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">The need for consultancy varies from time to time depending on business projects and priorities. As can be seen from the following tables Revenue's expenditure on consultancy is now at a significantly reduced level. It has decreased from €422,282 in 2008 down to €32,163 in 2011, which is very low especially when viewed against a total administrative expenditure in that year of €391.9m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">It must be acknowledged that the engagement of consultants is the appropriate approach for certain specialist activities or short term engagements.  Nevertheless, Revenue seeks to identify administrative savings in this and other subheads, and only approves expenditure on consultancy on a business case basis:</p>

            <p eId="para_3150">I met with the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) on 15 December 2011 and attended and spoke at the ILCU AGM on 28 April 2012.

However, the Government is seeking, insofar as is practically possible, to implement measures in a fair and equitable manner that will not unduly hamper the economic recovery that is underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_3155">As the Deputy is aware one has to read or listen very carefully to what emanates by way of statement from European Authorities. The general tone of such comments has followed the line that Ireland must honour commitments in relation to the repayment of debt. The Government is also committed to this principle. Commissioner Rehn and I both attend Ecofin meetings and this provides a regular opportunity to speak on the margins.  Notwithstanding this, the Government is also committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise IBRC. The purpose of this review is to determine if there is a way to reduce the overall cost to   the State. Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration. The troika has agreed to engage in this process to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3156">While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is a positive development we must keep our eye on the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and also the potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions. Further it should be borne in mind that recent concerns in the Eurozone underpin the fact our problems are part of a wider European dilemma and to the need for solutions to address the Irish situation as part of an overall Eurozone/global solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3157">It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments in relation to the Promissory Note repayment as an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it will be in the medium term rather than immediately. These discussions will continue and the Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. The ongoing discussions may also explore options to re-finance the long term Government bond issued in settlement of the March 31 payment. We all want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_3173">The Department is cognisant of developments impacting the European Banking sector, and in particular the level of leverage among European banks. I am also acutely aware of the dangers to economic growth which large scale deleveraging might give rise to. To this end we are working at a European level to mitigate the risks to growth from deleveraging of the European financial system and this consideration was reflected in the directions given to banks following the last EBA stress tests.  From an Irish perspective, we recognise that deleveraging initiatives among European banks may have an impact on the availability of credit to the Irish Banking system. But I would point out that the Irish banking system began the deleveraging process some time before its European counterparts and this progress is evident in improved sentiment and funding conditions for our banks.  The Covered Banks are ahead of their PLAR targets and the Department will continue to work constructively with each of the Covered Banks and the Central Bank to ensure that the pace of deleveraging is appropriate within the targets set out in the Financial Measures Programme and that sufficient credit is available to the system as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_3175">Since the international financial crisis began we have seen periods of intense market volatility as well as periods of relative calm.  In recent weeks, mainly on foot of political developments in a number of countries, we have seen increased uncertainty regarding the future direction of policy in the euro area and this is reflected in market developments.  Clearly there are lots of moving parts at the moment and I believe that, while unfortunate, continued market volatility can be expected until some of the key issues are resolved.  In this regard, developments at the Heads of State or Government level have an important role to play in terms of enhancing confidence and stability in the euro area and the preparatory meeting of Heads tomorrow and the formal European Council meeting in June will be key.</p>
            <p eId="para_3176">I would also point out that a number of important institutional reforms and policy measures are being implemented in order to address the situation, including the so-called six-pack of legislative reforms and the five-point strategy agreed by euro area Heads of State or Government last October.  In this context, the <i>Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union</i> also has a positive role to play by <i>inter alia</i>   creating certainty and stability.</p>

            <p eId="para_3222">I understand that the schools referred to by the Deputy have made enquiries with my Department regarding the amalgamation process.The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">As part of the Budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and by the school patron and not by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3225">This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times. The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3226">The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3228">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion. Some schools use parish or other boundaries for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based is matter for the individual school authority. In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">The Deputy will be aware that last June, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document, "Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment" contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">I have made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation. The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3233">I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last and my officials are now co-ordinating the submissions received. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3234">I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that every child has a place at school.</p>

Where schools are amalgamating there is provision for the allocation of a concessionary mainstream teaching post in certain cases where the approved number of mainstream teachers serving in the schools at the time the amalgamation takes place exceeds the number of mainstream posts warranted by the total enrolment on the basis of the staffing schedule. The continued allocation of the concessionary post is dependent on the teachers concerned remaining on the staff of the school and the appropriate enrolment figures being maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_3248">The standardisation of the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna so that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally was one of a number of measures introduced in Budget 2011 by the previous government to control and reduce teacher numbers. These changes came into effect from September 2011. Given the financial constraints in which this country now finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes. My announcement in June 2011 outlined new arrangements for the establishment of new primary schools.  The key elements that apply to the establishment of a new primary school are the demographics of the area must support the need for the establishment of a new school (or where meeting the demographics through the extension of existing schools would leave an unmet demand for diversity of patronage) and if the demographics require the establishment of a school, then the process for the selection of the type of school should allow for different patrons/bodies to be considered as the patron of the new school. Details of the new arrangements for patronage of new schools and the criteria for deciding on patronage of these new schools are available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_3301">I propose to take Questions Nos. 286, 287 and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3302">The July Education Programme (July provision) allows schools to open for the month of July, to accommodate pupils with severe and profound educational needs, and children with autism.  This is in response to concerns that children with autism and severe educational needs can regress over the summer due to the loss of structured learning during the summer months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3303">In order to facilitate the July Education Programme, four payments are payable to school staff:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3304">1. a Preparation allowance (generally paid to Principals),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3305">2. an Overseer allowance (generally paid to Principals),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3306">3. an allowance payment to Special Needs Assistants for work on delivery of the programme,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3307">4. a payment to teachers for delivering the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">While the payment to teachers is being fully maintained, the Preparation and Overseer allowances and the allowance payment to SNAs, fall within the terms of the public service wide review of allowances currently being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Given the exceptional circumstances of these allowances, and the potential disruption to planning and delivery of services in the near future, I can advise that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has provided sanction for these allowances to be paid to principals and SNAs for this year.  A revised circular will issue from my Department in the coming days to this effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">If schools decide not to offer July provision, my Department will make home tuition allowances available to the parents of children who would qualify to participate in July provision.  This will allow the parents to hire a tutor for 10 hours per week to ensure that the children involved remain in structured education during the month of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_3310">I am committed to continuing to support the educational needs of all children, and sincerely hope that most schools who have evidence of local demand will continue to offer July provision as a way of supporting those children and their parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_3316">To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course. The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. Given the level of demand on the student grant budget from first-time students and students that are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the arrangements currently in place. However, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners. Targeted initiatives such as the ICT Skills Conversion programmes and Springboard provide fully-funded higher education places for unemployed people. Under these initiatives, eligible participants have the opportunity to upskill or to re-skill at the same level of qualification they already hold into areas where there are identified employment opportunities.  While participation on a Springboard or ICT Conversion course does not create any entitlement to receive an income support payment from the Department of Social Protection, participants who are in receipt of such payments may be able to retain them subject to continuing to meet the eligibility conditions. On 21 May an additional 6,000 new places were launched under Springboard 2012. Full details on these courses are available on the website <i>www.springboardcourses.ie</i>.

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that conditions at a school (details supplied) in County Cavan have been reported as not satisfactory in a whole school evaluation carried out by his Department in 2008 and that conditions at the school have been unacceptable for years preceding that assessment and that the situation has continued to deteriorate over the years since; if he will ensure the school is restored to the list of approved school extensions with immediate effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3336">The project for the school referred to by the Deputy will continue to progress through the design stages of architectural planning within the context of available funding. However, due to competing demands on my Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project to tender and construction stage.</p>

This relief, which applies at the standard rate of tax, is available to full time and part time students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU Member States.

            <p eId="para_3343">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process.  As part of the new staffing arrangements my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">The school submitted an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board.  All appeals submitted to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board were considered in accordance with the published appeals criteria that is set out in my Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  This was done at its meeting on 18th and 19th April. The appeal by the school was unsuccessful on the basis that the school did not meet the published appeal criteria.  However, the Appeal Board will review this decision in September if the school's actual enrolment in September 2012 increases to the required level.  The Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">A summary outcome of the appeals is now published on my Department's website. Individual schools have been notified of the outcome of their appeals.</p>

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3531">Ireland has been allocated a total of €901m in EU Structural Funding for the period 2007-13.  Of this, €750 million is assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) objective, and the balance to Territorial Co-operation programmes, including the including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.  The RCE objective is being delivered through three operational programmes, the National ESF Human Capital Investment OP, managed by the Department of Education and Skills, and the Border Midland and Western (BMW) and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF (S&amp;E) OPs, managed by the BMW and S&amp;E Regional Assemblies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3532">The general programme priorities in Ireland are the promotion and encouragement of innovation, the knowledge economy, enterprise, research and development, up-skilling the workforce and increasing the participation of groups outside the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_3533">It is expected that the overall objectives of each programme will be achieved and that Ireland will drawdown all the funding we have been allocated.  Ireland currently has no unallocated Structural Funds. Indeed, recent Commission figures show that Ireland has the highest absorption rate for Structural Funds in the EU.  48% of our overall allocation under the 2007-2013 round has been drawn down or is in the process of being drawn down, and it is expected that the remaining 52% allocated to Ireland will be drawn down over the lifetime of the round.</p>
            <p eId="para_3534">As the Deputy is aware, there are discussions at EU level about a potential package to stimulate growth and competitiveness.  If additional EU funding, through unallocated structural funds or otherwise, becomes available, Ireland will of course make the necessary application. I discussed these issues last week in meetings with the EU Commission and the European Parliament.</p>

            <p eId="para_3536">Since coming into office, the current Government has been working on a range of measures to boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.  The first such measure announced by the Government was the Jobs Initiative, launched in May 2011, which comprised a range of taxation and expenditure measures of €1.8bn designed to help get people back to work.  Further work to stimulate economic growth and create employment is ongoing and, in this context, my Department has been actively engaged in identifying potential new sources of funding for projects where it makes sense and offers value for money for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3537">As part of the review of capital expenditure carried out by my Department last year, all Departments were invited to submit proposals in relation to their capital expenditure priorities for the period 2012 to 2016.  The results of that review were published in the "Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework" which sets out €17 billion worth of Exchequer investment intended to address critical infrastructure investment gaps in order to aid economic recovery, social cohesion and environmental sustainability. The sectors prioritised for investment in the Framework include education, health, jobs and enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3538">The Government is now considering carefully what potential further projects could be supported should a source of additional funding become available.  It is likely that such investment would be focused on areas that meet the Government's key investment priorities, boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.  Submissions made by Departments as part of the Capital Review process have formed the basis of any consideration of projects to be progressed should a source of funding become available. My Department has also established a high level interdepartmental steering committee which will consider potential projects for investment.</p>

Various reports have identified the need for Departments to bolster their specialist skills in areas such as ICT, human resources, project management, accountancy and economics.

In relation to the use of my car for Ministerial travel under this scheme, the total cost for the period May 2011-May 2012 has been €119,337.32.  This cost includes mileage (which is to cover car related expenses), the salaries paid to civilian drivers, travel and subsistence paid to the drivers and Employer PRSI contributions in respect of the two drivers. This amount is significantly below the €280,000 average annual cost under the previous domestic Ministerial transport regime for each Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_3587">On 8 May last I, along with Minister Varadkar, announced the Government's intention to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and to bring it together with Shannon Development to form a new entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership. The Government's decision represents a new beginning for the Shannon region, involving a drive to develop a world class aviation industry in Shannon and  a restructuring of enterprise and tourism agencies in the region to support this goal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3588">From an enterprise perspective, Shannon Development's functions in relation to indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Shannon Free Zone will transfer to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland respectively. The new entity will work closely with both these agencies to develop the potential of the aviation sector, as well as exploring other opportunities with them for further prospective investments in the region. It will continue to support the property needs of both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland clients in the region. To ensure a smooth transfer of enterprise functions, I have asked the Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to prepare a plan for the delivery of enterprise supports in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_3589">Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland currently have responsibility for promoting indigenous industry in, and attracting FDI investment to, the Tralee Technology Park. I can confirm that this will remain the position under the new arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3590">In making the announcement, Minister Varadkar and I indicated our intention to establish a Steering Group to determine the most effective organisational structure of the new entity, develop an implementation strategy for the new body and a plan setting out how it will help to achieve strong regional development while ensuring the highest standard of support for enterprises in the Shannon region. We expect to make a further announcement in this regard shortly.</p>

In light of this and the continuation of the moratorium on recruitment introduced in March, 2009, my Department has no plans at present to recruit graduates this year.

            <p eId="para_3617">Whilst it is unclear as to what is meant by the reference to unregulated liquidation sales in the Deputy's question, it is the case that a number of different regulatory obligations may apply to those involved in the retail sale of goods or services. Many of these obligations relate to regulations concerning planning, fire and safety of premises etc. Such matters are the responsibility for local authorities and I have no function in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3618">Insofar as my own area of responsibility is concerned, the Occasional Trading Act 1979 requires persons selling goods at a place, not being a public place, where the person selling has been in occupation of less than 3 months, to hold a permit granted for that purpose by my Department. Should the Deputy be concerned that any persons may be engaged in occasional trading without holding the necessary permit, he may wish to bring such matters to the attention of the National Consumer Agency who have responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the 1979 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3619">I would also point out that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 prohibits traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices. The Act provides that a commercial practice may be considered misleading and, therefore, unfair if it involves the provision of false information, which would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision he/she would not otherwise make. The Act also prohibits traders from making representations that they are about to cease trading if they are not. Should the Deputy be concerned that there are traders providing false information in relation to their trading status or who are making representations that they are about to cease trading when they are not, he may wish to bring his concerns to the attention of the National Consumer Agency who have responsibility for enforcing the relevant provisions of the 2007 Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_3621">I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in the period from the beginning of January 2011 to the end of April 2012, there has been 1 site visit by potential investors to county Tipperary sponsored by IDA.  Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards deal with indigenous industry and do not sponsor similar type site visits by investors.  At the end of December 2011 there were 12 IDA client companies in County Tipperary employing 3,356 people, while Enterprise Ireland had 129 client companies employing 5,197 people in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_3622">The global economy and, in particular, the European economy, which is the primary target market for FDI clients in Ireland, is in a low growth phase. The challenge for IDA Ireland is to win FDI in this low growth environment. There is intense and continual international competition to win this FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million i.e. London, Manchester, Singapore, Amsterdam, Boston, Los Angeles etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3623">As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  IDA also promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3624">Typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements and, in certain cases, other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis. In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland will endeavour to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3625">The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.  I recently announced the progress which has been made in this regard so far this year.  Meanwhile, I am already getting suggestions and proposals in relation to preparing the Action Plan for 2013, which I am examining and will bring to Government later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3640">I welcome the successful outcome of discussions at the International Labour Conference (ILC) that led to the adoption of a new international labour standard aimed at ensuring Decent Work for Domestic Workers.  The final text of the draft Convention was one that the Irish Government was in a position to support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3641">I am aware Uruguay is the first country to ratify the Convention. The issue of ratification by Ireland of this Convention is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments.  In this regard, the Convention will be examined from the perspective of any changes that may be required to existing domestic legislation.  However, it is important to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_4015">The position is that Vodafone tendered for its Mobile Customer Service work earlier this year. Rigney Dolphin was the incumbent provider, with 290 full-time equivalent positions at Vodafone's offices in Dundalk and Dublin. However, a French company, Teleperformance, won the new tender; this company has operations in Newry, Co. Down.  I understand that this change has arisen as a result of Vodafone's review of customer care and the necessity for the company to provide services as cost effectively as possible. As you can appreciate, the market for these types of contract is extremely competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4016">Some time ago, I met with Vodafone Ireland and the company has confirmed it is likely that this work will move to the Teleperformance site in Newry. I have been assured by Vodafone that the transfer of service will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4017">Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin entered a consultation process with employee representatives.  Vodafone has had extensive dialogue with the Communications Workers Union as part of this process and everyone affected has been offered a job.  Terms are in place for those employees wishing to avail of voluntary redundancy.  I understand that most points have now been agreed with the Union.  As always, the State's industrial relations machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission, is available to assist in this process, if requested.  While the situation that has arisen on this occasion is regrettable, it is nevertheless reflective of the competitive forces that affect the sector concerned.  In relation to State support, IDA did not provide any financial assistance to bring the Vodafone operation to Ireland and has not provided any subsequent financial support to the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_4052">My Department participated in the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (referred to as the Keane group) and is a member of the Steering Group set up by the Minister for Finance to oversee and drive its overall recommendations.  The Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group recommended that an independent Mortgage Support and Advice Service be established to advise mortgage holders in arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options. The report stated that the need for this service would be time limited to approximately 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">The publication of the heads of the Personal Insolvency Bill in January 2012 propose the introduction of a four step process to address personal insolvency issues with the first three steps involving non-judicial debt settlement arrangements. This is a new arrangement and was not envisaged when the thinking in support of a Mortgage Advisory Service was originally proposed. My Department is examining the role envisaged for the Personal Insolvency Trustee to ensure that there is no conflict with or duplication of Government supported services.  From the customers perspective for example, the target group and complexity of the problems that need to be addressed appear to be similar and from the advisory perspective, the skills and expertise required would also appear to be similar for both services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">My Department is chairing a Working Group as part of the Implementation Steering Group to examine the issues relating to the establishment of the Mortgage Advice Service. As part of its remit it is examining the efficiency, necessity and governance arrangements of potentially two separate services. The needs of the customer, the importance of ease of access and information on services and the way in which the services will be made available must be to the fore.</p>
            <p eId="para_4055">Given that more than 70,000 people have already entered into arrangements with their lenders, it is important that any new service would focus on those who have yet to engage with their lender and support those who are in the earlier stages of negotiations with their lender as a first step in seeking to resolve their difficulties.  The Working Group has not yet concluded its deliberations. It reports regularly to the Implementation Steering Group and to the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears.</p>

Results from Census 2011 show that there are a total of 5,695 properties classified as bedsits in the State with the majority in the Dublin area. The census also shows that 5,307 of these bedsits are rented.</p>
            <p eId="para_4062">Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the Local Authorities. However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department's officer administering supplementary welfare allowance to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of the non-compliance with standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4063">Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant it is recommended that the designated officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.

            <p eId="para_4069">In order for a participant to remain on CE for more than one year, certain conditions must be met.  One condition is that a participant must have a minimum of 156 weeks on the Live Register, on Community Employment or other recognised training interventions such FAS training, or a combination of all these.  Of the 156 weeks, 52 weeks must have been continuously spent on the Live Register prior to starting in order to qualify for CE in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4070">In the case of the 203 EGF participants that availed of CE places, all met the initial qualifying criteria, as laid out in current operating guidelines as set out above prior to commencement.  These clients occupied additional places, funded by the EGF from their commencement date up to 29th June 2011, the final day under which funds could be claimed from the EGF.  Participation from that date was funded from the regular CE budgetary allocation and was dependent on employer requirements as part of the mainstream allocation of places on CE.  Approximately 109 clients remain on CE for a further 52 weeks. This is the period of time for which they would have been eligible to participate on a mainstream CE place under current guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_4071">Of the 109 former EGF clients remaining on CE, 40 will finish on 22nd June 2012, the final date on which their maximum participation has been reached under current guidelines.  The remaining 69 will finish at various dates in the future, depending on their individual circumstances, as governed by the guidelines on participation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4086">A financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is underway and is nearing completion. This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4087">Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes has taken longer than originally envisaged to complete.

            <p eId="para_4088">However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4093">I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 436 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4094">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 95,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4095">As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_4096">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">The analysis of the rental market for Wicklow carried out by the Department found that rental prices for Bray were having a distorting effect on the prices for Wicklow as a whole.  Accordingly Bray was excluded while establishing rent limits for county Wicklow. The rental area considered was extended to include both Greystones and Delgany, areas which were of close proximity to Bray with housing in those areas directly affecting the rental market for Bray.</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">Both Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy were evaluated and have been assigned the new Wicklow rates. It is important to bear in mind that the purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4099">I will be publishing the report which outlines the rationale for establishment of the new rent limits for the Bray, Delgany and Greystones area shortly. All indications to date show that, for each county, the new rent limits are permitting rent supplement tenancies to access suitable housing.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this stage there are no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_4171">The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">Before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme, a range of complex issues need to be examined in detail.

            <p eId="para_4194">There have been no changes to the Community Employment (CE) eligibility or duration rules for many years. The last change was announced in July 2006 whereby persons in receipt of a CE-qualifying disability-related social welfare payment could remain for one additional year over and above the standard maximum CE participation limits (3 years total participation for those below 55 years of age and six years total participation for those of 55 to 65 years of age — only counting CE participation since 3rd   April 2000).</p>
            <p eId="para_4195">There are two strands of Community Employment — Part Time Integration Option (PTI) and Part Time Job Option (PTJ). PTI Option is intended for those who have been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months. This Option is limited to 1 year on CE at a time, with flexibility to renew the contract for a subsequent year in 10% of cases where it is deemed the individual would benefit from extra time on the scheme. The request to extend a participant into a subsequent year is made by their CE Supervisor and is then decided by the Department's Community Development Officer (CDO) with responsibility for the CE project, based on the case made by the Supervisor and operational factors. At the end of the second year they must exit CE for a minimum of 12 months. If they wish to return to CE they must requalify in the standard manner. The PTJ option is intended for longer-term unemployed persons and those in receipt of a qualifying payment for at least 3 years. This Option is based on annually renewable contracts for a maximum of 3 years participation. At the end of first year, the participant's Supervisor applies to extend their participation to the CDO at least 8 weeks before their proposed exit date. If the person is considered "job-ready" at this point they are not renewed into another CE year. If their continued participation would enhance their employability prospects, they can be contracted to CE for a further year. The same process is repeated at the end of the second CE year to ascertain if a third CE year is the most suitable intervention for the participant. Again, a person considered "job-ready" would not be retained in order to free up the place for another person to have the opportunity of the CE place. There is no <i>entitlement</i>   to 3 years under this option, only the flexibility to avail of up to 3 years on CE based on the participants progression levels and assessed personal needs at the end of each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4196">All CE participants are subject to the participation caps as detailed above.</p>

            <p eId="para_4235">Eight retired former public servants were recruited on short term contracts in the Department of Social Protection from June 2010. These officers were employed on a part time basis as Appeals Officers, and their contracts terminated at the end of December 2011.  One of the Department's Medical Assessors was retained on a temporary contract beyond retirement which ended on the 20 January 2012.  Between October 2011 and end of February 2012 some 300 staff retired from the Department.  The Department's Chief Medical Advisor was the only official of this number who was retained beyond his retirement date of 29th February 2012 and is currently employed on a temporary contract basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">The decision to re-employ or retain this small number of staff was taken due to their specific skills and experience, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department. In all cases, the combined pension and rate of pay did not exceed the salary level of the individual.</p>

            <p eId="para_4241">I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 384 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4242">The social welfare and tax systems have evolved over time and in response to a variety of factors, including Constitutional imperatives as interpreted by the Courts, changing social trends and EU Directives.  Up to the end of December 2010, the social welfare code recognised the couple status of opposite sex co-habiting couples and treated married and opposite sex co-habiting couples in a similar manner for means testing and other purposes.  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (<i>Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare, 1989</i>) led to this change in the treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code. The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p>
            <p eId="para_4243">Following the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act, 2010, further changes in the definition of a couple for social welfare purposes were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2010. These changes amended the social welfare code to recognise the introduction of civil partnership. In addition, the code was also amended to treat cohabiting same sex couples in the same way as cohabiting opposite sex couples. This means that, for means testing purposes for jobseeker's allowance and other means tested schemes, married couples, civil partners and same and opposite sex cohabiting couples are treated in the same manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_4244">The income tax arrangements and subsequent legislation for married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples generally are a matter for the Minister for Finance. I have not been in contact with that Minister on the income tax treatment of these couples.</p>

            <p eId="para_4270">The person concerned was refused carers allowance on the grounds that the Department's Medical Assessor expressed the opinion that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full time care and attention as prescribed in regulations.   Additional medical evidence was received and forwarded to the Department's Medical Assessors for further consideration.  However, this information did not alter the opinion of the Medical Assessors and the decision remained unchanged.

These cost elements include insurance, full membership of AA/RAC, road tax and licence. The engine size of my car is 1400cc and the rate applicable is 46.25 cent per kilometre.</p>
            <p eId="para_4316">The mileage costs, which I have claimed since 1 May 2011 to 31 March 2012, amount to €8,341.92.</p>
            <p eId="para_4317">I have two civilian drivers, both on a remuneration rate of €631.75 per week. The total salary costs involved to date has been €56,580.25.</p>
            <p eId="para_4318">They may also claim travel and subsistence allowances, in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regulations for necessary absences on official duties from home and headquarters. Total cost of travel and subsistence claimed by my drivers to date is €1,225.04.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">The total cost incurred in all of the above amounts to €66,147.21. On taking office the Government reformed the transport arrangements for Ministers which has radically reduced the costs of travel — the average cost of providing transport has been reduced by 65% from the previous transport system (average cost €280,000 in 2010 to a current annual estimate of €100,000 per annum).</p>
            <p eId="para_4320">The system adopted is based on the system that has been in place for Ministers of State since 1984.</p>
            <p eId="para_4321">The previous practice whereby all Ministers were provided with State cars and Garda drivers fell within the remit of the Department of Justice and in this regard details of the costs involved would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4355">The One-Parent Family Payment (OPF) has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents.  Changes have been made to the payment since its introduction in 1991, reflecting the changes taking place in society, the labour market and the expectations and realities of parents' lives, and, particularly, of mothers, in terms of work and care.  Changes introduced in the last two Budgets continue these reforms.   Changes were introduced to the OFP scheme in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.  These came into effect on 27 April 2011, and reduced the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP to 14.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2012, enacted on 1 May 2012, continued the reform process.  The reduction in the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP is being applied to new and existing customers on a phased basis and will not affect existing customers until 2013.  For new recipients, from 3 May 2012, the OFP payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12.  This will reduce further to age 10 in 2013 and to age 7 in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_4357">For existing recipients, there will be a tapered phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.  Specifically, for pre-27 April 2011 customers, the current tapering arrangement will remain in place until 2015 — after which the age limit will reduce to age 7.  For customers in receipt of the OFP from 27 April 2011 to 3 May 2012, the current age limit of age 14 will remain in place in 2012.  The age limit will then reduce to age 12 in 2013 and will further reduce to age 10 in 2014 and to age 7 in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_4358">The reductions to ages 10 and 7 will be considered in the context of the further development of relevant activation and support services.  When fully implemented, it is estimated that the measures will yield full-year savings of €29.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4359">Commencing in January 2012, the OFP scheme will see a reduction, over five years, of the earnings disregard from €146.50 per week in 2011 to €130 per week in 2012, to €110 per week in 2013, to €90 per week in 2014, to €75 per week in 2015, and to €60 per week in 2016, for new and existing recipients.  When fully implemented, this measure will yield   full-year savings of €76.1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4360">Until 31 December 2011, recipients of the OFP for 52 weeks, whose income exceeded the scheme's €425 weekly earnings disregard limit, were entitled to a transitional payment that was paid at half of the rate of their OFP payment for a period of 26 weeks, after which the payment would cease completely.  From 1 January 2012, the transitional payment will no longer be issued to new and existing OFP recipients.  Their entitlement to the OFP payment will automatically end if their earnings exceed the €425 weekly earnings disregard limit.  Existing recipients of the transitional payment are not affected by this measure and will continue to receive the payment for the balance of six months. This measure will yield      full-year savings of €1.03 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4361">From 1 February 2012, and 2 February 2012, respectively, the entitlement to half-rate Illness Benefit (IB) and Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) for persons in receipt of the OFP has been discontinued for new recipients.  This measure will yield full-year savings of €22.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4362">With regard to the changes that were made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, the following reforms are of relevance for those in receipt of the OFP and on CE:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4363">From 16 January 2012, a number of social welfare payments, including the OFP, are no longer payable concurrently with CE.  This applies to new applications and will not affect existing recipients.  This measure will yield full-year savings of €61.2 million across all schemes affected.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4364">Also, from 20 January 2012, for new and existing claimants, the payment of two Qualified Child Increases (QCIs) of €29.80 per week per child will no longer apply to recipients who are on a CE scheme and in receipt of certain social welfare payments, including the OFP.  The QCI for CE will cease and one QCI will continue to be payable with the relevant social welfare payment.  This measure will yield full-year savings of €6.25 million across all schemes affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4365">The following changes will also impact on OFP recipients:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4366">From 1 January 2012, measures introduced in Budget 2012 increased the minimum contribution payable by all tenants under the rent supplement scheme from €24 per week to €30 per week.  This measure will affect all of the approximately 97,000 tenants who are on the scheme — 15,900 of whom are in receipt of the OFP — and will yield full-year savings of €55 million in respect of all rent supplement recipients.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4367">From September 2012, the payment period of the fuel allowance will be reduced from 32 weeks to 26 weeks from the months of September until May of each year.  This measure will affect all of the approximately 425,000<b> </b>  recipients of the allowance — 68,000 of whom are in receipt of the OFP — and will yield full-year savings of €51 million in respect of all fuel allowance recipients.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4368">The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) will be reduced from €200 to €150 for children aged 4 to 11 years, and from €305 to €250 for children aged 12 to 22 years, for the 2012 scheme.  This measure will yield full-year savings of €17 million in respect of all BSCFA recipients.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4369">From 1 January, 2012, for new and existing recipients, income from employment as a home help funded by the Health Service Executive, will be assessed in means tests for social assistance schemes, including the OFP.  This measure will affect approximately 2,000 people and yield full-year savings of €5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4370">The reduction of the Child Benefit rate for third and subsequent children, and the discontinuation of the Child Benefit grants on multiple births, will also impact on OFP recipients where relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4371">With regard to the impact of such changes, income support for people of working age, including lone parents, has been passive in nature, with little systematic engagement by the State with the customer.  This is now changing.  Long-term welfare dependency and passive income support to people of working age are not in the best interests of the recipient, of their children, or of society. Despite significant levels of State spending on one-parent families, as well as improvements made to the scheme over the years, lone parents and their children continue to experience high rates of ‘consistent poverty'.  Consistent poverty is the official measure of poverty used by the Government to set the national poverty target in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016</i>. Consistent poverty is a targeted measure that identifies the population that is both at-risk-of-poverty (income below 60% of median income) and experiencing basic deprivation (lack of two or more basic necessities).  EU-SILC figures show that, in 2010, 9.3% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing consistent poverty.  The comparable rate was 16.6% in 2009 and 17.8% in 2008.  However, the rate of consistent poverty among lone parent households continues to be one-third more than that of the population as a whole.  The Government recently revised its national poverty target to meet Ireland’s contribution to the Europe 2020 Strategy and its commitments in the Programme for Government.  The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2%, which will lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the risk of poverty or exclusion between 2012 and 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4372">As indicated, the OFP payment has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents.  It is, however, recognised that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  Work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and of their families. The reforms introduced into OFP scheme will require a whole of Government response with regard to the provision of the appropriate education, training, employment and child care supports, including the provision of appropriate after-school care.  The development of the National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) and the profiling of jobseekers, which is already under way in my Department, will lead to a better identification and understanding of the supports that individual customers need and the extent to which these are available and affordable.</p>

            <p eId="para_4375">It should be noted that his average figure includes the time taken to award claims made under EU regulations and bi-lateral agreements — these cases are complex and tend to take a longer time to process than domestic cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4376">In addition, it is important to note that IP claims are not processed solely in the order in which they are received in the Department.  Priority is given to those claims where the customer is in receipt of short-term illness benefit (IB) but where their IB is due to expire — such claims are processed in order of the due date for the expiry of their IB.  IP claims received from customers who are in receipt of IB but where their IB is not of finite duration are processed on a separate track, in order of date of receipt in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4377">The average of 32 weeks refers to the time taken to award new IP claims of all three types.</p>

            <p eId="para_4387">The majority of Community Employment projects are managed and operated by third party limited companies and the remainder by Public and Local Government bodies.  As such my Department have no direct role in purchasing materials or services for these organisations.  The funding of the Community Employment programme is by way of ‘grants towards' allowances, wages, materials and training. In deciding the amount of such grants Department officials continuously monitor and approve these grants in line with market conditions and obtaining value for money.  Department officials also monitor and review the operating guidelines in order to minimise the costs to these organisations in operating a CE scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">As a result, significant savings are being achieved in relation to insurance and audit costs.  Further savings are envisaged in relation to bank charges.  There continues to be an onus on the scheme providers to achieve best value for money for taxpayer's funds.  Such savings can be achieved in the current marketplace for the provision of business services such as broadband, electricity and phone through efficient procurement procedures.</p>

To this end, my Department is currently finalising a best practice manual on re-use of protected structures.  This will complement my Department's existing architectural conservation advice series and will be of assistance to local authorities and owners in ensuring a sustainable future for our stock of protected structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_4631">In this regard, my Department's policy and best practice advice consistently recommends that appropriate new uses are identified and pursued for vacant protected structures, as this is the best means of ensuring conservation of their architectural heritage.</p>

            <p eId="para_4633">During the transcription of the 1911 census, independent statistical analysis, supplemented with scrutiny by a genealogist expert in Irish names, was commissioned to establish the levels of accuracy of transcription.  The average level of accuracy was found to be 99.21%, regarded as perfectly acceptable by international standards.  The accuracy threshold set by The National Archives in Britain for the 1911 census was 98.5%.  Genealogical scrutiny continued during the transcription of the 1901 census, and accuracy levels were deemed to be similar to those for 1911.</p>
            <p eId="para_4634">The census website contains a dynamic error transcription form to allow users to report mistranscriptions.  Such proposed corrections have to be verified in the National Archives, and if found to be correct, are inputted to the database as and when resources permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4635">The census digitisation project cost €4.6 million, of which 21% was paid in VAT to the Irish revenue authorities.  The net cost to the state was €3.64 million.  The proposed budget was assessed as excellent value by the Director of the UK Data Archive, an expert in digitisation, before the project began.  Library and Archives Canada (LAC), the National Archives partners in the project, have world class expertise in digitising census records to preservation standard, and have provided the National Archives of Ireland with archival standard preservation images.</p>
            <p eId="para_4636">They also moved from a projected topographical index alone, to a names index, and finally to digitisation of all the fields in the census, without an appreciable increase in the budget.  They have digitised all of the information in the census, such as religion, occupation, literacy and marriage information, place of birth, Irish language proficiency, etc.  The extra information greatly enhances the site's value to scholars of Irish history as well as to family researchers, and makes the Irish census site the most comprehensive free census website in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_4637">To date, the site has received 700 million hits and 14 million visits, and is extremely popular with Irish citizens and the Irish Diaspora.</p>
            <p eId="para_4638">Clearly, the lessons from the work on the 1901 and 1911 census will inform work on the 1926 census.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4662">As the Deputy is aware, the individual referred to in the Question has applied to sell his interest in land in a raised bog special area of conservation under the voluntary bog purchase scheme, administered by my Department. As outlined in my reply to Question No 287 of 8 November last, a contract for the sale of the site in question had been forwarded by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and was under review by officials of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4663">However, in the light of issues which have arisen more generally in relation to the voluntary bog purchase scheme, I decided that applicants could, if they wished, transfer instead to the compensation scheme established by my Department for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This would allow applicants to retain ownership of their land holding or rights while availing of compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4664">This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of €1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State. An additional once-off payment of €500 will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_4665">Accordingly, my Department has recently written to applicants under the voluntary bog purchase scheme — including the applicant referred to by the Deputy — to outline their options under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme as an alternative to proceeding with their applications under the purchase scheme. For the sake of clarity, I should state that this approach relates to applicants under the voluntary bog purchase scheme who have not received a letter of offer or have received a letter of offer but where contracts have not been signed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4667">The 2007 EU Eel regulation (1100/2007), drafted in response to the endangered status of the European Eel, required EU States, including Ireland, to develop an Eel Management Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4668">Based on the scientific facts available, a recommendation of this plan was that Ireland close both the commercial and recreational eel fisheries in 2008.  Bye-laws, Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 303, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009, were signed by the then Minister in 2009 prohibiting the capture of eels.  There was no provision for compensation for those who previously engaged in this fishery on a commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4669">The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland — IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4670">In June, the status of eel in Ireland, and across Europe, will be reviewed as part of the reporting requirement for the 2007 EU regulation.  This will include a review of the status of the eel stocks nationally and the potential for commercial fishing in the future.  Also a public consultation process is due to commence in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4671">The report will clarify and update the situation for eel fishery in Ireland and it will inform any decision to open the fishery or to keep it closed.  In line with the conservation imperative, no eel fishing will be permitted in the interim.</p>
            <p eId="para_4672">The status of the European Eel in Ireland was recently defined as critically endangered (Ireland Amphibians, Reptiles and Freshwater Fish Red Data List, published in 2011).  Scientific analysis estimated that 2007 Eel escapement (adults going to sea) was at 23% of pristine stock and declining.  Due to the very long cycle and slow growth in Irish waters it is probable that any recovery of the Irish eel stocks will be over a very long time frame.</p>

            <p eId="para_4680">The rules to which the Deputy refers are the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2011.  Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 336 of 2011 transposes the requirements of EU Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (ePrivacy Directive) as amended by the EU Directive 2009/136/EC (Citizens' Rights Directive).</p>
            <p eId="para_4681">Regulation 13 of S.I. No. 336 seeks to protect individuals from receiving unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing.  This Regulation covers the making of unsolicited phone calls and the sending of unsolicited fax messages, email and SMS (text messages) for direct marketing purposes and gives individuals the right to prevent organisations from using electronic means to contact them in order to sell a product or service.  The requirement of this Regulation extends to all forms of marketing carried out by means of publicly available electronic communications services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4682">The Regulation transposes an amendment to Article 13 of the 2002 Directive which was transposed into domestic law in 2003.  At the time of transposition in 2003 opt-out consent was provided for electronic marketing communications sent by an entity where the consumer has a prior business relationship.  Prior opt-in consent was provided for situations where the receiver has no business relationship with the sender.  This has remained unchanged since.  The new S.I. maintains these provisions.  No substantive case was made to change the balance struck which is consumer friendly and is aimed at ensuring proper protection from spam.</p>
            <p eId="para_4683">Two consultations were held prior to the transposition of the Directives, one in 2010 following the adoption of the Directives and a second in 2011 when the draft Regulations were available.  The Department also met with industry and agency representatives throughout the transposition process and the Regulations were drafted in consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner who is responsible for the enforcement of the S.I.  Consultation is a regular feature in the formulation of policy and legislation and the details of the consultations are not published in this instance.  Should the Deputy require any further clarification on aspects of the transposition, officials in my Department would be happy to speak further with him.</p>

            <p eId="para_4685">The provision of high-speed broadband to all secondary schools in Ireland is being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with our network partners, HEAnet, following the successful completion of a pilot project that ran from 2009 to 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">The procurement of the connection necessary to deliver the high-speed broadband for each school is proceeding under an existing Framework Agreement as a commercial service.  Given the commercial nature of the connection, the broadband will only be available to each individual school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">The provision of access to these connections for the wider community would not be in line with the commercial agreements that have been entered into and there would also be a number of technical, financial and legal impediments to providing wider community access under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, has had an important role to play in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Taskforce report has now been published.  The report notes that by 2015, over 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal. Following on the publication of the Taskforce report, I have also launched a 4 week consultation process.  The purpose of this consultation is to provide further input to this important policy area.  Thereafter, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for a National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  This plan will build on the recent excellent progress made and be informed by the findings of the Taskforce and subsequent consultations.</p>

The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a National Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.  The EMP includes a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of management actions and their implementation.

This review will consider whether the eel fishery could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.

         if, with respect to the payment of corporation tax by operators of oil and gas fields in Irish territory under Ireland’s licensing terms for oil and gas exploration, development and production, as adopted in 1992 and 2007, these licensing terms allow for the operator to write off costs incurred in other countries against their profits to be declared in Ireland; if these licensing terms allow the operator to write off the costs of unsuccessful wells drilled in Irish waters against their profits; and if so, if these licensing terms allow the operator to write off the costs of unsuccessful wells that are outside the licence area of the well on which profit is being calculated against that profit, in each case, in which the 1992 and 2007 terms differ; and if he will state the difference.

         if it is the case that under Ireland’s 1975 licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration, the State would have taken a carried interest in any exploitation of an oil or gas discovery; and if this would have amounted to a 50% share in the project, irrespective of whether the State had shared in the cost of exploration.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_4712">I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 to 466, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4713">The fiscal terms for petroleum exploration and production are set out in the Finance Acts, while the operational frameworks are detailed in the 1992 and 2007 Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development.  Since 1992 a corporation tax rate of 25% has applied to profits from all oil and gas production offshore Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4714">In 2007, following a comprehensive review of Ireland's licensing terms, both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised fiscal terms provided for a new supplementary tax, known as a profit resource rent tax, of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate already applying.  The revised fiscal terms were implemented in the 2008 Finance Act and apply to production arising from exploration licences granted since 1st January 2007.  Standard exploration licences 1/11 (Barryroe) and 2/11 (Kish Bank) are subject to the provisions of the 2007 Licensing Terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">Write off of expenditures against tax liability is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance and the application of tax law is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand that in the event of a commercial discovery, historic exploration capital expenditures incurred in Ireland in the 25-year period prior to the commencement of field production are 100% deductible against corporation tax at the start of production.  This includes capital expenditure on exploration activities outside the lease production area but excludes expenditure incurred in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4716">The 1975 Licensing Terms, which were introduced at a time of optimism in regard to commercial discoveries of oil and gas, provided for State participation up to a maximum of 50% in a commercial discovery, subject to the State paying its appropriate share of all relevant exploration and development costs.  No commercial discoveries of oil or gas were made under these terms and this provision was deleted in 1987.</p>

            <p eId="para_4828">There is no contract between TV3 and my Department.  TV3 is a commercial broadcaster and I have no role in the operation of TV3 nor in its commercial or business decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4829">TV3 operates under contract from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to provide a national commercial broadcasting service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for TV3 to operate on SAORVIEW, should it wish to do so.  TV3 has made a commercial decision to use the SAORVIEW service and in that regard space has been made available on SAORVIEW for the two TV3 channels — TV3 and 3e.</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">SAORSAT is a satellite TV service developed and operated by RTÉ.  Its aim is to provide coverage of the RTÉ and other TV channels carried on it to the last 2% of the population so that all the people of Ireland can chose to receive these channels on a free to air platform.</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">RTÉ is not required to provide SAORSAT and has developed the service on its own initiative.  RTÉ's legislative obligation is to provide a national digital TV service and I am informed that this obligation is fully met through their SAORVIEW service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4833">I understand from RTÉ that SAORSAT currently carries RTÉ1, RTÉ2 (HD), TG4, RTÉ1+1, RTÉjr, RTÉ News Now and 10 Irish radio channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4834">I also understand from RTÉ that, subject to agreement of the necessary commercial arrangements, carriage on SAORSAT is open to TV3 should they decide that they wish to be carried on the service.  That decision, however, is a commercial matter for TV3 in the first instance.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_715">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_4836">Ireland remains critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas which are subject to price volatility and geo-political rise. This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security.  Ireland's energy policy objectives are in line with overall EU policy objectives and are informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">I am aware of the paper to which the Deputy refers and which has just been published.  It is a working paper which does not represent the views of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or IMF policy.  It models a range of possible future oil prices, based on, respectively, geological and technological assumptions.  The paper's conclusion certainly points to potential permanent very high increases in oil prices over the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_4838">Upward trends in global oil prices underscores the Government's commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4839">The electrification of transport offers huge potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4840">In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4841">The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The scheme ensured that 144.5 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4842">The Better Energy programme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, as well as bringing on board energy suppliers as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers.  Low income households are also addressed through a specific retrofit programme aimed at protecting such households from energy poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4843">Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5051">In September, 2006, my Department launched the programme, Action on Private Rented Accommodation Standards.  Arising out of this programme, new regulations prescribing minimum standards for rented accommodation, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, came into effect on 1 February 2009. The revised regulations were prepared following consultations with key stakeholders, including landlords' and tenants' representative organisations, and the four-year phasing-in period for certain aspects of the regulations applying to existing accommodation was specifically designed to afford landlords the time either adequately to meet the revised minimum standards or to remove unsuitable accommodation from the rental market. A Regulatory Impact Assessment outlining the cost and benefits of the revised standards was conducted prior to the introduction of the 2008 Regulations and copies are available from my Department's website <i> www.environ.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_5052">Article 2 of these Regulations sets out the date from which the Regulations take effect. This depends on whether or not the house is an existing rental property or a new let.  Existing rental properties will continue to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993 until 1 February 2013.  However, any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009 have to comply with all the requirements of the new Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5053">The purpose of Article 6 of the Regulations is to ensure that each rental property has exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities and that those facilities are contained within the dwelling unit. This provision will have the effect of removing non-compliant bed-sit-type accommodation from the rental market. Article 7 relates to effective heating which can be independently managed by the tenant and Article 8 provides for sole access to adequate facilities for hygienic storage, preparation and the cooking of food.</p>
            <p eId="para_5054">I am satisfied that the private rented residential sector contains a sufficiently large stock of decent housing and of good landlords to ensure that those previously renting accommodation at the lowest end of the market can still be accommodated within that market but in better quality accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5055">All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.  I expect that landlords will behave responsibly and prepare for the 1 February 2013 deadline as referred to above but I also expect that local authorities will pay particular attention to this aspect of landlords' obligations as they enforce the minimum standards in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_5056">A detailed analysis of the composition of the housing market in Ireland will be available later this year when the housing profile segment of the 2011 Census is published.</p>

            <p eId="para_5078">I propose to take Questions Nos. 478, 492 and 493 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5079">The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. Under section 12(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Act a landlord is obliged to promptly refund deposits unless, and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, there is rent or other charges or taxes owing or there is damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear.</p>
            <p eId="para_5080">My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 and the incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in the review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention. In July 2011 the Government approved the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011. My Department is currently liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the drafting of the Bill. The Programme for Government 2011 commits to the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and it is important that action in this regard is taken in the context of a strong evidence base. I have therefore asked the PRTB to commission analysis-based research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations. I understand that the PRTB has recently awarded the tender for this research and I expect that the Board will revert to me with detailed research and recommendations in Autumn 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5094">There are three distinct stages to water conservation on public water supply schemes.  The first stage involves a local authority putting in place a water management system to enable the authority to monitor water use and loss throughout the supply networks.  Under the second stage of the programme the authority establishes an active leakage control programme which involves locating and fixing leaks and, based on the results of these two stages, they must establish a prioritised pipe rehabilitation strategy for its area.  The final stage comprises the rehabilitation and replacement of defective supply networks where repair has proven to be uneconomic due to the age or condition of the pipes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5095">In the case of Cork County, the Council has not yet completed the preliminary phases of water conservation, including the strategy for rehabilitation for water mains on a countywide basis.  However, Cork County Council has recently submitted a proposal for advanced Stage 3 rehabilitation works to my Department involving works in 141 separate locations throughout the County.  This includes proposals to rehabilitate almost 750 meters of watermain in Summercove, Kinsale.    As a general rule, and in the interests of securing best value for money from Exchequer investment, the Department does not authorise a local authority to undertake mains rehabilitation works unless the authority has largely implemented the water management and leakage control works necessary throughout its functional area and has completed its strategy for mains rehabilitation on a prioritised county-wide basis.    However, given the priority attached to water conservation and the level of unaccounted for water in the Cork County,  my Department will assess   the Advance Stage Rehabilitation Works proposals, including consideration of whether funding can be provided at this stage for the proposals contained therein for water main rehabilitation works in Summercove, Kinsale.</p>

            <p eId="para_5097">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).

            <p eId="para_5098">While there is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the charge, nationwide advertising has taken place each year since its introduction in 2009 to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally. Communications have also been issued to persons who paid in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5099">Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.

The number of households on waiting lists continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.  Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need, which was carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department’s website, www.environ.ie, or on the Housing Agency’s website, www.housing.ie.  In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government’s housing policy statement, which was published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government’s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</summary>

            <p eId="para_5123">I assume the question refers to projects funded under Axis 3 and 4 of the Rural Development Programme, an EU co-funded programme for which my Department has responsibility.  State aid refers to any aid granted by a Member State which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or goods.  Commission Regulation EC 1998/2006 allows for aid of up to €200,000, known as <i>de minimis</i> aid, to be provided from public funds to enterprises over a period of three years as this amount is considered too small to have an effect on economic activity between competing forces.  In the original Rural Development Programme (RDP) document approved by the EC in July 2007, Ireland concluded that, as the aid to be granted under two of the Axis 3 measures of the RDP would be for non-commercial projects, it would not constitute State Aid and would therefore not be required to comply with the <i>de minimis</i> limits.  This was recently supported through a formal EU State Aid notification process undertaken earlier in 2012.  The measures concerned, Basic Services for the Economy and Rural Population and Village Renewal and Development, provide support for non-commercial community based projects and focus particularly on community infrastructure.  Maximum grant amounts of €500,000 are allowable under these two measures.  During the design of the RDP, it was concluded that many of the projects possible under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure would have commercial elements and accordingly funding awarded under the measure would have to comply with the <i>de minimis</i> regulation.</p>

         the reason the number of community representatives on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has been reduced to five; the criteria used in the selection of those members; the reason the dockland community of East Wall has no representative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5129">Section 16 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 provides for the appointment of a Council to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  In particular, Section 16 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that not less than two ordinary members of the Council shall be appointed from among persons selected by the organisations prescribed under each paragraph of subsection (5), subject to eight persons being appointed in all.  The organisations prescribed under subsection (5) are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5130">(a) organisations which are concerned with, or are representative of persons engaged in, the promotion or carrying out of social, economic or other development (including employment, education, training and the development of land) in the Dublin Docklands area;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5131">(b) organisations which are concerned with community development in the Dublin Docklands area or with the promotion of the social, economic or general interests of communities in that area; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5132">(c) organisations which are representative of persons whose professions or occupations relate to town planning, urban design, architecture, conservation of the architectural heritage or civil engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_5133">On 10 May 2012, I appointed a new Council which followed the statutory appointment provisions, including those set out above.   In this regard, there is no entitlement to have more than two appointees from category (b) above, nor is there any entitlement to have a category (b) appointee from any specific geographical area within the Dublin Docklands area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5134">I am satisfied that the broad range of stakeholders from the different categories of nominating organisations as well as from the statutory bodies who have nominated representatives should provide the Council with the necessary expertise, skills and local knowledge to assist and advise the Authority in its work.</p>

            <p eId="para_5136">Private residential tenancies, with limited exceptions, are governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the main provisions in respect of rent and rent reviews are set out in Part III of that Act. Under section 19 of the Act, it is prohibited to set the rent under a tenancy at a rate above the market rent at either the beginning of the tenancy or at any subsequent rent review. Both tenants and landlords have the right to a review of rent, even where there is no provision to that effect in the tenancy agreement. Such a review may not take place more frequently than once in each period of 12 months nor in the first 12 months of the tenancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5137">If non-compliance with the provisions of the Act relating to rent and rent reviews lead to a dispute between landlord and tenant either or both of the parties to the tenancy may refer the matter to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) for resolution.  The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits, and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_5138">The Rent Tribunal, established under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Act, 1983, is the arbitrating body in the determination of the rent and other terms of tenancy of dwellings which were formerly rent controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts 1960-1981.  The Tribunal may determine new cases or may review cases previously determined by the District Court or by the Tribunal itself.  Since October 2009 the administrative functions of the Rent Tribunal have been carried out by the PRTB.</p>
            <p eId="para_5139">With regard to local authority housing, local authorities set rents for social housing tenants based on their Differential Rents Schemes.  While it is a matter for each authority to determine an individual's rent, the principle of the scheme is that a household is charged a rent based on a proportion of their income.</p>
            <p eId="para_5140">I have no plans to introduce legislation in relation to rent control at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5260">As the Deputy is aware, the moratorium on Public Service recruitment continues to apply to An Garda Síochána. A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirements in the Garda Síochána and Government targets, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.  As a result, no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College or for the commencement of a recruitment competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_5261">In addition to this, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.</p>

He has remained in the State with varying status since then.  He married an EU Citizen in August, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5264">On 16 January, 2012 and 10 February, 2012 the solicitor for the person concerned wrote to the EU Treaty Rights Section of INIS stating that their client wanted to regularise his status in the State on the basis of his previous residency in the State as a student initially, and then as the spouse of an EU citizen.  The Solicitor of the person concerned advised that the person's EU citizen spouse was no longer resident in the State and stated that she had departed in either 2007 or 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5265">I am advised by my officials that having examined the details of the case and having made further enquiries in the matter, it appears that the person's EU Spouse citizen left the State in early 2008.   EU Treaty Rights Section, by letter of 11 April, 2012, through the person's solicitor, advised that it was not possible for the person concerned to regularise his permission under EU Treaty Rights, as his EU citizen spouse ceased to exercise her rights when she left the State.  He was also advised to attend his local immigration office to discuss his status as he no longer had any immigration status to be in the State since 17 July, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5266">I am informed by officials in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that there is no record of any application for a certificate of naturalisation being made by the person concerned.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_5267">Among such requirements is that an applicant must have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded, such as periods granted for the purposes of study, and periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5268">The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator can be used as a guide to whether an individual satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.</p>
            <p eId="para_5269">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5272">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and also submitted written representations pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).

            <p eId="para_5273">The Subsidiary Protection application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_5274">In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted, including those relating to the possible relevance of the Zambrano judgment to the case, will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p>

I am advised that no formal complaints have been submitted in respect of the process referenced by the Deputy.  Should any applicant wish to raise concerns regarding any decision this can be done via the Human Resources Division of my Department.  Should any applicant wish to avail of feedback this too can be facilitated in a similar fashion.</p>

Accordingly, recruitment opportunities will only arise in very limited and targeted circumstances.

            <p eId="para_5332">As the Deputy may be aware, the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations, S.I. 307 of 2009, which came into force in August 2009, is the regulation governing the secure storage of firearms in the home.  These Regulations set out the minimum security standards outlined in relation to the provision of secure accommodation for those firearms.</p>
            <p eId="para_5333">The regulations provide that where three or more restricted firearms, or six or more firearms in total are stored together, then an  intruder alarm system, which complies with I.S. EN 50131, or an equivalent standard approved by the Garda Commissioner, is required.  This 50131 standard requires that the risk of tampering with alarm systems is minimised and the monitoring of such alarms is supported by GSM telephone service back up.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">As per these Regulations, the Garda Commissioner is in a position to approve an equivalent standard for alarms, including any alternatives to the current approved standard.  Therefore any changes to regulation of this area will be considered following advice from the Garda Commissioner.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner to keep the matter under review. If the Deputy has any specific instances of the theft of firearms which she wishes me to look into I will gladly raise the matter with the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">Furthermore, the Private Security Authority (PSA), an independent body under the aegis of my Department, is responsible for the regulation and licensing of the security industry in Ireland.  As part of its licensing requirements, the PSA prescribes that all intruder alarms are installed in accordance with the requirements of the standard IS EN 50131. The PSA is aware that the electronic security industry is working to combat the use of GSM technology to tamper with alarm monitoring systems and will continue to review the standards as is necessary to ensure that best practice is applied to all alarm installations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5340">The increase in court fees introduced earlier this year follows a detailed evaluation by the Courts Service including the establishment of a working group to review the system of court fees.  The group recommended a broad range of fee increases, most of which have now been implemented.  The fee increases were essential in light of increasing costs and having regard to the current economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5341">The position in relation to summary judgment costs, as the Deputy observes, is that there has been no increase in the costs of judgment in default of appearance in the High Court since 1983.  I am informed that in 2008 proposals were submitted to increase this cost to €850, an increase of approximately 700% which was considered excessive.  I am conscious of the need to ensure that inter-party costs are reasonable.  However, given there has been no increase for nearly 30 years and taking into account the costs anomaly between the Circuit and High Courts, there is undoubtedly some justification to making provision for an increase.  The issue is currently under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_5343">During the period leading up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, bodies representing the mixed trading sector proposed implementation of a voluntary code of practice with an independent audit and oversight mechanism as an alternative to section 9 of the Act. A voluntary Code was subsequently drawn up and agreed between the mixed trading sector and the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A new body — Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Ltd (RRAI) — was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation of the Code. Mr Padraic While was appointed as the independent Chairperson of RRAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_5344">On receipt of Mr White's third Compliance Report on the RRAI Code in October last, I launched a public consultation process inviting views on the Report and, more generally, on the voluntary approach to implementing structural separation of alcohol products in such premises. Arising from the consultation process, I am not in favour of retaining the voluntary RRAI Code. The choice, therefore, lies between implementation of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 or implementation of a statutory code of practice under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011. I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for my proposals in relation to future arrangements for the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5345">As regards below-cost selling of alcohol products, the recently published Report of the Steering Group charged with drawing up a National Substance Misuse Strategy recommends the introduction of a legislative basis for minimum pricing per gram of alcohol. I understand that this proposal is being actively considered by the Department of Health in the context of the development of an Action Plan to address the Steering Group's recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5347">I very much welcome the Dublin Declaration as a clear and progressive contribution from the European Network of Judicial Councils. As the Deputy may be aware, following my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I requested my officials to conduct an examination of the current appointment procedure with particular reference to the practice in other jurisdictions. This review is wide-ranging and includes consideration of the following issues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5348">the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5349">eligibility for appointment;</p>

            <p eId="para_5354">The Deputy will also be aware that under the Irish Constitution judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the names of all persons who have informed the Advisory Board of their wish to be considered for appointment to that vacancy and the names of at least seven persons whom it recommends for appointment. I then bring the names to Government. Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5355">The review of the current appointment procedure is ongoing and I will consider the matter further on completion. Any proposal to revise the current system of judicial appointments would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_5366">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5367">The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.  One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</p>

Ireland is not unique in this respect.  In many previous responses to Dáil questions, I have dealt with the origin and purpose of the direct provision, by which the State discharges its obligations to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers.  The system allows the State to ensure that a suitable standard of accommodation, food and ancillary services are provided to asylum seekers resident in the State.  Dispersal ensures that the pressure on health, welfare, education and other services is evenly distributed to allow an efficient management of resources in those areas. The policy of direct provision and dispersal is one of the central features of the State's asylum system and the need for the system remains.</p>
            <p eId="para_5387">I am satisfied that the human rights of asylum seekers are respected in the direct provision system. Asylum seekers receive nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available to the general population.  Asylum seekers receive a health service, including mental health services, on the same basis as Irish citizens and it is, in many cases, far superior to what is available in their countries of origin. Children of asylum seekers are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.  Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies. Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR, by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner and by the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI).</p>
            <p eId="para_5388">In relation to complaints mechanisms, I have explained in previous Dáil responses that the revised RIA House Rules and Procedures set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party.  The Rules also set out in detail how a resident can go about requesting a transfer as well as the types and standard of service that an asylum seeker should receive whilst residing in direct provision accommodation.  This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for ‘internal complaints systems'.</p>
            <p eId="para_5389">In relation to "de-skilling" and social cohesion, the existing statutory position in Ireland provides that an asylum seeker shall not seek or enter employment. This prohibition is retained in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I intend to republish later this year. Extending the right to work to asylum seekers would almost certainly have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so.</p>

As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. I can, however, inform the Deputy that enormous progress has been made in dealing with the backlog and steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications and to have made significant inroads into them by the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5401">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government introduced a number of changes for the provision of Office Holder transport during 2011.  One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions. The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_5479">I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available.   The current economic situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and for upgrading and refurbishment programmes over the coming years.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5480">A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations.  In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_5519">In terms of the current position, the number of women serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) on 30 April 2012, the latest date for which figures are available, was 555, of which 459 were serving in the Army, 29 in the Air Corps and 67 in the Naval Service. This represents 6.25% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit. In 2007, the Department received the report of a TNS/MRBI study it had commissioned, titled "Retention and Recruitment of Women in the Defence Forces". This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action could be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining. The question of retention was also studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_5521">The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving women agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work. In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70%-80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer. The recommendations of the report have been implemented and the challenges identified therein continue to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5522">The Defence Forces, on the direction of the Chief of Staff, has established a Working Group to examine levels of participation by women in the organisation. The Working Group will, <i>inter alia</i>, inquire into why women apply or do not apply for positions within the Defence Forces and what can be done to increase awareness among women of a career in the Defence Forces. The data gathered from the review will be used to formulate new policies in this area, specifically aimed at increasing participation by women in the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5523">The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner.</p>

My Department is always mindful of the costs involved in engaging consultants.

            <p eId="para_5668">The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 and Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota availed of the sugar restructuring scheme, dismantled all its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_5669">The total compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime   was worth a total of €353 million to Ireland. This sum was made up of €220 million to beet growers, €6 million to machinery contractors and €127 million to Greencore. The beet growers' share was made up of restructuring aid of €53 million, diversification aid of €44 million and €123 million via the Single Farm Payment. All elements of the Restructuring Scheme have now been implemented, not just within Ireland but across the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_5670">The present EU sugar regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015, in accordance with the prevailing EU Regulations. There is no mechanism under the current Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">Of course, sugar beet has always been grown here to be used as animal fodder. I know Deputy Mulherin will be aware that I have strongly supported the full abolition of sugar quotas from 30 September 2015 as part of the CAP reform discussions which are currently under way in the Council of Ministers, and which, if agreed, would replace the existing quota regime. This would enable interested parties to re-engage in the production of sugar. I also raised the issue with the Agriculture Commissioner Ciolos during his visit to Ireland in January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">In 2011 I also met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility here. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. I also further suggested to both groups the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">The People's Millennium Forests Project was a flagship Millennium project sponsored by the National Millennium Committee and AIB and managed by Coillte in association with Woodlands of Ireland.  This was the largest ever project directed at the expansion and enhancement of our native woodlands.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">There were 16 sites involved in this project, 14 of which are in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland. The mission of the People's Millennium Forests Project was to ensure that all future generations can enjoy the benefits of Ireland's native forests.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">One element of the Project was the "Household Tree Scheme" whereby each household in Ireland had a native tree planted at one of the 13 sites of the 14 sites in the Republic of Ireland.  The 14th site was exclusively for the protection of a unique native yew wood in Killarney. While a certificate was issued to each household in relation to the "Household Tree Scheme", it did not confer legal ownership of the tree to that household. The context in which the trees were planted is that they would be part of a woodland community that would remain in place in perpetuity.  People were invited to participate in the People's Millennium Forests Project by visiting the forests and to enjoy the ever-changing natural environment of native woodland with its associated flora and wildlife.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">I am aware that 12 of the 16 sites involved in the Peoples Millennium Forest Project form part of the Coillte forest estate.  As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.  The protection of the People's Millennium Forests is one of the issues to be considered in the decision-making process in relation to the possible sale of Coillte assets.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_5681">I have responded in detail to questions previously put down by the Deputy regarding issues raised by the person to whom the Deputy refers. I have explained, in my earlier replies to the Deputy, my Department's responsibilities with regard to the welfare of horses and the options open to the individual should he wish to further progress complaints relating to the welfare of horses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5682">My Department's responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only, i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. The relevant legislation in the matter raised by the Deputy is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, S.I. 311 of 2010.  Animals "used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used" are outside the scope of S.I. 311 of 2010. Accordingly it is clear that complaints relating to the welfare of horses in training are not covered by this legislation and thus currently fall outside the remit of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5683">The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals including race horses, in this country, is the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation rests with An Garda Síochána who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5684">I have clarified to the Deputy in the past that my Department has no role, or jurisdiction, in resolving the issues referred to, hence there can be no question of my Department compensating this individual. It is for the owner of the race horses to decide if or he wishes to report  matters to the Gardaí or indeed if he wishes to institute civil proceedings. It is my understanding that complaints made to the regulatory bodies have been investigated and the outcome of those investigations have been made known to the complainant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5685">The Programme for Government 2011 contains a commitment to strengthen legislation on animal cruelty and animal welfare. The main vehicle to fulfil this commitment is the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill which consolidates and updates existing legislation in the area of animal welfare and brings the responsibility for the welfare of all animals under the remit of my Department. The Bill is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.</p>

The closing date for 2012 Single Farm Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes was 15th   May 2012.  It is not possible to estimate the amount payable under these Schemes at this point in time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_5850">The Deputy will be aware that, in the context of the European Commission's proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2014 to 2020, the proposal to gradually move away from payments based on historical production towards a system of uniform national or regional payment rates by 2019 raises serious concerns for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5851">Such a system would result in very significant transfers from more productive farms to more marginal and less productive land. Analysis carried out by my Department indicates that, under a national flat-rate model, the most productive farmers would lose, on average, about one-third of their current payments, while the least productive farmers would see their payments rise by an average of 86%. Alternative redistributions based on a two-region model, or even an eight-region model, would have similar outcomes. I do not believe that these outcomes are compatible with my commitment to sustainable intensification of production, the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy and the achievement of the objectives of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5852">I accept that we cannot continue to base our payments on production references that will be more than 10 years old by the time this round of reform comes into effect. I also accept that there is capacity for the less productive sector to become much more productive in the coming years. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission's proposal. I believe we can strike a better balance by managing the gains and losses arising from any redistribution, for example by putting a limit on the amount that any farmer could lose. This would be consistent with the Commission's desire to achieve a more level playing field, but would avoid a disruptive level or pace of change. The ‘approximation' approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5853">I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions, and to adopt a more gradual, back-loaded transition process, rather than the very rapid, front-loaded approach proposed by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5854">I will continue to work intensively with the Commissioner and with my counterparts at the Council of Ministers to achieve the required flexibility, and to come up with an acceptable solution that acknowledges the need to move away from the historic model but does not have the dramatic redistributive effects inherent in the current proposals.</p>

Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed annually before any payment can issue.  Payment in respect of the 2011 Scheme year is subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investment through checks on receipts.  During these checks queries were identified in relation to the capital expenditure claim of the person named. These queries have been resolved and payment in respect of 2011 will issue shortly.</p>

         his plans to review the implementation of the changes introduced last year to the TB eradication programme; in view of the restrictions being placed on adjoining landowners, if he will review his policy on the threshold for the blood testing for TB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_805">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_6164">As I have explained in reply to recent Parliamentary Questions, the changes to the TB eradication programme which were introduced by my Department earlier this year are designed to improve the effectiveness of the programme by tightening up on overdue testing and preventing the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds. Thus, greater stress is being laid on ensuring all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds and export markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_6165">I want to emphasise that these changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals. With regard to neighbouring or contiguous herds to a high risk breakdown, the only change from previous arrangements is that these herds are now being trade restricted, except to slaughter, pending a TB test. Previously, such herds were permitted to sell cattle on the open market prior to carrying out the test and research had shown that this posed a risk to clear herds. The objective of the restriction on neighbouring herds is to protect clear herds from buying in infected animals from these herds and thereby avoid the clear herd being restricted for 4 months and the associated additional testing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6166">Following representations made to my Department, I have clarified a number of issues in relation to the new disease control arrangements and introduced modifications to a number of others. For example, I have made it clear that the trade restriction on contiguous herds only applies to those herds which are identified, following an epidemiological investigation by my Department, as being relevant to the breakdown herd and which have not been tested in the previous 4 months. Herd owners will be contacted by my Department prior to restriction and only those herds which, on a case by case consideration, are identified as genuinely relevant to the breakdown will be restricted. Those farmers whose herds are restricted can minimise any impact by arranging to have their herds tested as soon as possible. Any herd which tests clear will be immediately de-restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_6167">In addition, my Department has clarified that trade restricted herds will not be deemed ineligible for the Russian trade. Furthermore, I have amended the arrangements relating to the new overdue testing rules such that herdowners who, based on genuine reasons, negotiate a delay of up to one month with the DVO prior to the overdue date will not have any penalties applied. I am also removing the restriction on the movement of animals into trade restricted herds during this one month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_6168">While I am pleased to have been in a position to clarify and bring certain flexibility to most of the areas raised with me, the question of the 4 and 6 month rule is in a different category where the type of change sought gives rise to a disease related risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_6169">With regard to blood testing for TB, such testing is confined to already identified diseased herds. There has been no change to this policy and none is contemplated.</p>
            <p eId="para_6170">There has been a significant reduction in both the herd and animal incidence of TB over recent years. Herd TB incidence was 7.53% in 2000 compared to 4.18% in 2011. During the same period, reactor numbers have fallen from 40,000 to 18,500, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950's. While I am very pleased with this improvement, my Department subjects the TB eradication programme to on-going review with a view to ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place. The prevention of the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds is an important factor both in achieving the goal of eradication and in continuing to secure funding from the EU.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary in light of experience.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_807">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_6174">In the first instance, I would like make a clear distinction between the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information) Bill and the draft Heads of the Children First Bill. The focus of the Withholding Bill is on the responsibility of all citizens to provide information to the Gardaí where they have knowledge of a serious sexual crime against a child, in the investigation and prosecution of that crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_6175">The focus of the proposed Children First legislation is on the protection of individual children about whom a report is made and other children who may be at risk from an alleged perpetrator of abuse. Its aim is to make organisations safe places, and to ensure that key people in authority in these organisations, and named professionals report to and co-operate with the HSE information about abuse and serious neglect.  The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i> has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of <i>Children First</i> and in the case of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, <i>Children First</i> has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of <i>Children First</i>   throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6176">It would appear that the Deputy's question relates to the role of the Designated Officer, under the proposed legislation. Under Children First, organisations are required to appoint a Designated Officer. The Designated Officer has responsibility that staff and volunteers are vetted, recruited properly and are trained in safe practices with children and in recognising signs of abuse and neglect. The Designated Officer makes information available to parents about child protection in the organisation and will have a system in place to check and report on its compliance with the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6177">In the legislation, it is proposed that the Designated Officer along with certain named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE. The obligation to report abuse extends to abuse and neglect wherever it occurs, that comes to the attention of the Designated Officer in the course of his / her work or volunteer activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6178">Where a young person does not want to talk further about an allegation of abuse, he or she will not be required to. However, the information will be assessed by the HSE to see if other children could be at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_6179">To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a ‘Guidance for Reporting of Abuse' is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will assist designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, in their considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6180">It is important to note that the Protection for Persons Reporting Abuse, 1998, which came into operation on 23 January 1999, created a new offence of false reporting of child abuse. This provision remains in force.</p>

            <p eId="para_6184">My Department currently administers three support programmes — the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6185">During 2011, all areas of expenditure within my Department were examined under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Under this review savings of some €16.5 million in current funding have been agreed for my Department for 2012. While my Department is in a position to retain all three support programmes, it is necessary, in view of the reduced funding, to make some revision to certain payment rates and subvention levels under each programme.   The CETS<b> </b>programme provides qualifying FÁS and VEC students with free childcare places for the duration of their course.  The Department currently pays childcare services €170 per week for each full-time place contracted under the programme, in some 1,600 community and commercial facilities.  This is the only category of parents who currently pay no contribution to the cost of their childcare requirements.  From September 2012, the Department will reduce the weekly price paid to services to €145 per full-time place.  However, services will then be allowed to charge a weekly fee of not more than €25 per full-time childcare place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6186">The Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining the three childcare support programmes at this time. However, the changes made to capitation and payment rates are necessary because of the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure. While I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by the three childcare facilities referred to by the Deputy,  I would point out that other crèches will continue to operate under the new funding arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6187">Finally I can  assure the Deputy that the parents will be facilitated to continue their studies by the provision of places in other local facilities, and that the local City Childcare Committee is working on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_6190">I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 and 592 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6191">Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.  Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention. </p>
            <p eId="para_6192">A delegation from the Adoption Authority  visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption. Yesterday, 21st May, I received a Report from the Authority summarising the conclusions and recommendations of the delegation's visit.  While this is now being considered in my Department, the AAI has stated that it has decided to seek further legal advice in Ethiopia on whether adoptions there are full or simple adoptions. The Authority has further stated that it will contact me again once it has received the legal advice referred to and completed its consideration  of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6193">I have also been advised that the Authority has decided to post an advisory on its website in relation to the visit to Ethiopia.</p>

            <p eId="para_6198">The Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption entered into force for Vietnam on 1 February 2012. The ratification of the Hague Convention by Vietnam, the associated changes in Vietnamese law and the arrangements being put in place to support on the ground implementation represent significant changes in the inter-country adoption regime in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_6199">Under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010,  the Adoption Authority may enter into administrative arrangements with another contracting State.  In this context, the Authority has prepared and submitted to the Vietnamese authorities a suggested scheme of administrative arrangements to be established between Ireland and Vietnam for the resumption of inter-country adoption between the two States. The Authority is awaiting the response of the Vietnamese authorities to this proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_6200">In January I had a very positive visit to Vietnam focussing on inter-country adoption.  It provided the opportunity for direct, personal engagement with the Vietnamese authorities, and the fostering of cooperation between our two countries on inter-country adoption. My visit coincided with a visit of a delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland to Vietnam to discuss administrative matters in relation to inter-country adoptions on foot of Vietnam's recent ratification of the Hague Convention. I have recently written to the Vietnamese authorities formally inviting them to visit Ireland in the coming months at both Ministerial and official level.</p>
            <p eId="para_6201">The Adoption Authority registered one accredited body for the purposes of adoption mediation within Vietnam. Further applications from other bodies remain under consideration by the Authority and a decision is anticipated shortly in this regard. Agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority of Ireland also require the approval of the Vietnamese authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_6203">The HSE has advised that waiting times for inter-country adoption assessments have reduced considerably across the country. According to the HSE the waiting time for assessments varies around the country and, in general, the maximum waiting time is 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_6204">The Adoption Authority informs me that waiting times between the sending of an adoption application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries may vary greatly and may extend to as much as 3 years or more in some cases. The Adoption Authority has no influence with regard to the waiting times involved in these sending countries. Furthermore, some jurisdictions require a two stage adoption process which entails post-placement reports being submitted during an initial period of guardianship before an adoption is approved and finalised. Hence, while a number of applicants would have referrals of children and some would be in the process of completing the post-placement requirements of sending countries, they would not have finalised the adoptions by court order and therefore would not be in a position to register the adoptions with the AAI.</p>

            <p eId="para_6206">Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline. My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda Síochána to advance this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6207">The position is that Comreg, who have responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland, received an application to operate the Hotline from the ISPCC.  Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project team, Comreg has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The operation of the Hotline is now a matter for the ISPCC who have made an application for funding to the European Commission and a decision on this application is pending. The ISPCC are currently finalising the project plan for the Hotline.</p>
            <p eId="para_6208">The Project Team has met with the ISPCC and in the coming months the Project Team will work to ensure that the Hotline becomes operational as soon as possible and operates in a way that supports and augments existing arrangements to secure child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_6209">In the meantime the ISPCC has developed, with An Garda Síochána, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda Síochána and if it is a child calling for assistance to contact the ISPCC.</p>

            <p eId="para_6211">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">The programme includes a number of provisions to enable children with special needs to benefit fully from the programme.  These include an option for children with special needs to apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme 2 days a week in the first year and over 3 days a week in the second year.  Applications for this option must be made prior to the child commencing the programme so that the necessary arrangements can be made with the childcare facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_6213">In addition, the upper age limit for participation in the programme (4 years and 6 months) may be extended where a child is not in a position to commence primary school until s/he is more than 5 years 6 months of age because s/he has been assessed as developmentally delayed.  Applications for such  extensions are examined by the Department on a case-by-case basis.</p>

In that regard, I would refer to the fact that the Guidelines on Information and Tracing services first issued by the Adoption Board in 2004 included acknowledgement of historical existence of a practice of illegal birth registrations and offered the Board's assistance in efforts to obtain any records that might still exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_6238">I am aware from the Adoption Authority that, in mid 2010, the Adoption Board conducted a review of information it retained of contact received from persons who had been told or believed themselves to be adopted, but where no adoption records existed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6253">The Government has decided that health service employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 by the end of this year, in line with its commitment to reduce public expenditure.  The employment control framework for the health sector, including children and family services, is expected to be finalised shortly.  It is not anticipated that any particular grade will be exempted from the recruitment moratorium.  Priority posts can be put in place where this is possible within the employment ceiling and budget.  Accordingly, the National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE, Gordon Jeyes, will as I have previously advised, apply his discretion to the filling of vacancies subject to these conditions being met.</p>

            <p eId="para_6255">The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and families in 2012 is an important part of the ongoing "change agenda", which is aimed at strengthening organisation capacity, business processes and systems, and will pave the way for the transition to the new Child and Family Support Agency in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_6256">The Government has made additional budgeting provision of €19m for child welfare and protection services compared to the funding made available last year.  The funding will assist in addressing expenditure pressures from budgetary reductions made in previous years and growth and demand for services due to demographic and other factors. In overall terms, the 2012 provision is designed to support the HSE in meeting its obligations with regard to the welfare and protection of children under the Child Care Act 1991, together with a range of  priorities set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2012. These include particular emphasis on the completion of a series of reforms across children and family services in order to provide a comprehensive range of high quality services; implementation of Children First and the continuing delivery of commitments in the Ryan Implementation Plan.   Management of these services is being led by the National Director, Mr Gordon Jeyes.</p>

            <p eId="para_6262">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides one free pre-school year to each eligible child, is implemented by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6263">The ECCE programme was introduced in January 2010, and a number of transitional measures were included to make it more acceptable to the childcare sector.  One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38-week or a 50-week model.</p>
            <p eId="para_6264">I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38-week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The Síolta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50-week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_6265">My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, from September 2012, services participating in the ECCE programme will be required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_6268">Officials of my Department have been in contact with Scouting Ireland with regard to the Deputy's query and Scouting Ireland has advised that scouting is open to all young people between the ages of 6 and 25 who are supported in their challenges of personal progression and development by volunteer adult leadership.  In 1987, Scouting Ireland from its founding associations, decided in favour of a coeducational approach and since that time has made significant progress in building an integrated organisation where boys and girls can learn together through the Scout method. More than 90% of its groups are mixed gender groups and some 40% of its young members and 50% of its adult volunteers are female.  Scouting Ireland has stated that it is encouraging its few remaining single sex groups to embrace a coeducational programme.  Scouting Ireland has advised my Department that all its new groups are opened on that basis.  In the meantime, Scouting Ireland has indicated that the young person who wishes to join its Balbriggan Group will be offered a place in a selection of neighbouring groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_6269">I welcome the work by Scouting Ireland to provide activities to both boys and girls on an equal access basis and would encourage the adoption of this practice by all scouting groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_6298">With effect from 1 November 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption (the Hague Adoption Convention) or with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Kazakhstan has ratified the Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_6299">Over the past 18 months the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for inter-country adoption.  To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI.  The Authority has continued to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of inter-country adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year.  I understand that an official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow has now presented the copy correspondence to, and raised the issue of inter-country adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p eId="para_6300">I understand the Kazakhstani authorities hosted a meeting on inter-country adoption on the 11th of May.  I would like to point out that at no stage were the AAI, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Embassy contacted by the Kazakhstani authorities regarding the meeting.  As soon as the issue came to the attention of my Department, official contact was made with the Embassy in Moscow in this regard.  The Embassy officials in Moscow are endeavouring to secure feedback from this meeting to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on inter-country adoption between Ireland and Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p eId="para_6301">My officials are actively pursuing the matter in conjunction with the AAI. The Embassy has been asked to request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In the interim the AAI is currently completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6305">My World Survey, Ireland's first comprehensive national study of youth mental health was launched on 16th May by Headstrong — The National Centre for Youth Mental Health and UCD School of Psychology.  It tracks evidence of the damaging link between drinking behaviour and mental health in young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_6306">Mental Health is a priority for the Government including the mental health of our young people.  A special allocation of €35 million for mental health was announced in Budget 2012 in line with Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation for mental health will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children's mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is on every team.  Some of the funding will also be used to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_6307">The report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group made a range of recommendations that impact directly and indirectly on the problem of excessive youth alcohol consumption.  At this juncture, the recommendations of the Steering Group are encouraging public debate and I envisage an Action Plan being developed in advance of proposals being drafted for Government that will take account of, among other things, the recommendations of the Steering Group that relate to this problem.</p>

The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.  I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_6315">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_6316">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_6317">As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

            <p eId="para_6392">I can confirm that to date there have been no changes to the waiting list data capture categorisation since the patient treatment register (PTR) was established in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6393">As you are aware a new target of 9 month maximum waiting time for daycase and inpatient surgery has been implemented.   The challenge for 2012 is firstly to maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time target for in patient and day case procedures and then to continually improve and move to a 9 month maximum waiting time target.</p>
            <p eId="para_6394">At present the categorisation of patients within the scheduled care system is neither defined with sufficient clarity nor enacted for each patient with sufficient consistency. The lack of clarity is contributed to by some ambiguity and vagueness within the existing definitions; and the lack of consistency by insufficiently rigorous attributions within hospital data sets, and inadequate audit and review processes.  Unless we succeed in introducing much higher levels of clarity and consistency, effective systems management will be impossible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6395">In that context it is the intention later in 2012 to request clinicians to categorise their referrals as either "urgent" or "routine".  It is important to emphasise that determining urgency will always rest with clinicians.</p>

            <p eId="para_6404">Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, eligibility for public health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  All persons normally resident in the state are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services.  It is unacceptable for a patient to be informed at short notice that a hospital will not treat them because they are in the ‘wrong' catchment area and my Department has been working with the HSE to clarify its policy in this area.  Currently the HSE does not collect information in relation to the numbers of patients transferred to other hospital waiting lists, however I can confirm to the Deputy that a letter has issued from the National Directors of the HSE and the Chief Operating Officer of the SDU setting out the position in relation to catchment areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6405">With immediate affect all hospitals will be requested to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6406">Refrain from any further limiting of historic catchment areas i.e. No further refusals of referrals from areas which such referrals have been accepted since 2009.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6407">This will be retrospective to the start of this year in most cases subject to discussion.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6408">This will apply to both "new referrals" and also to existing patients in long-term care / treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6409">I am confident that working with the RDOs and the hospitals that this particular issue will be quickly resolved.  The SDU will continue to work with the HSE to embed improved GP referral systems which will enhance patient access to the health services.</p>

(This figure may reduce as individuals decide not to avail of a day placement, stay in school, or are accepted to FÁS courses).</p>
            <p eId="para_6461">This year disability service providers are required to cater for demographic pressures, such as new services for school-leavers and emergency residential placements, from within their existing budgets.  Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals who require day and rehabilitative training places can be responded to within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6462">The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  There are already many excellent examples of collaborative working between providers and the HSE in innovatively responding to the needs of individuals.</p>

            <p eId="para_6476">I propose to take Questions Nos. 610 to 612, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6477">The Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Escalation Policy and Full Capacity Protocol is in place and has been operational since August 2011 in line with the National Guidance Documentation.  The policy is used to assist in the ongoing management and timely implementation of escalation procedures during periods of peak demand for in-patient beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_6478">The policy consists of a tiered and incremental suite of plans which are implemented in the hospital and community care areas as part of a multi disciplinary response to avoid Emergency Department overcrowding.  In addition to the timely placement of admitted patients in acute hospital beds, management, consultants and nursing staff must focus on reducing potential admissions, including electives outpatients, hospital transfers, hospital avoidance measures, and efficiently manage the treatment and patient discharge process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6479">In addition to the Full Capacity Protocol, I have approved funding to open 11 additional general Medical Beds in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  This additional capacity will facilitate the opening of a Short Stay Medical Unit which will streamline the provision of assessment and treatment by a Senior Clinician for the first 48 hours following admission.  It is envisaged that this development will reduce the length of stay for medical patients in OLOLH thereby contributing to a direct reduction in overcrowding in the Emergency Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6480">An analysis of attendances to the Emergency Department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for the first quarter of 2012 has demonstrated a 20% increase in attendances.  However the mean daily admission rate from the Emergency Department to an in-patient bed has increased and the mean time spent by patients in the Emergency Department has been reduced.  This indicates an improvement in the management of the overcrowding and the Management Team are committed to continuous improvement strategies to address the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6481">The Special Delivery Unit in my Department remains actively engaged with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda on this matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_6507">A core policy objective of the Government's health reform programme is to ensure equal access to healthcare based on need, not income, through a single-tier health service supported by universal health insurance.  Ensuring compliance with the contractual limits on private practice will increase the availability of consultants to treat public patients and help ensure that access to services in each hospital is determined solely by clinical priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_6508">Consultant Contract 2008 limits private practice for newly-appointed consultants on a Type B or C contract to 20% of activity.  The upper limit for consultants who held a contract prior to 2008 is 30%.  The HSE has put in place arrangements to measure consultants' private practice and to pursue issues of compliance where necessary.  The HSE has advised that currently 49 consultants have been identified as being in excess of the ratio specified in their contract.  The Contract provides for a series of steps to be taken where a consultant exceeds the level of private practice permitted in his or her contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_6509">The HSE has engaged with the medical unions and individual consultants to pursue the issue of compliance, with a particular focus on consultants who are significantly in breach of their permitted ratio.  There has been a significant improvement in the level of compliance with the private practice rules.  The matter is also being addressed under the Public Service Agreement and particularly the Health Sector Action Plan 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_6532">The HSE recognises that patients are unacceptably discommoded when cancellation of an outpatient (OP) appointment occurs.  Staff make every effort, often with short notice, to contact patients through phone or by letter, time permitting.  Occasions will occur in any health service which will necessitate the reorganisation of an OP clinic.  However these should be rare occurrences when a structured organised OP service is in place in a hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_6533">In recognition of the risks inherent in any disruption to a patient's arranged appointment time, best practice internationally would dictate that a well structured hospital OP service would require a minimum of six week's written notice from a service for any planned cancellation of either patient or clinic.  Further, such cancellations should be monitored and actively performance managed by the hospital in question.  The Special Delivery Unit intends to integrate and align existing HSE outpatient improvement projects, initiatives and clinical programmes under the SDU OP Performance Improvement Programme structure.  A key component of this overall programme will be to develop national plans and programmes, for local implementation that will be actively supported and performance managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6534">The outcome will be a fundamental re-engineering and standardisation of hospital process's around the delivery of hospital OP services placing the patient firmly at the centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_6544">Hospitals have built up informal catchment areas over a number of years and any individual hospital often has a number of "catchment areas" reflecting the different geographic areas from which it normally accepts referrals of different types.  Issues with catchment areas are typically cyclical and often reflect, amongst other things, the economic cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_6545">The growing budgetary and activity performance pressures on hospitals has led to some hospitals enforcing a more strict adherence to what they view as their catchment areas for different aspects of their service.  It has also been legitimately queried why, in some cases, patients are bypassing recently developed suitable services in hospitals closer to the patient requiring that patient to travel longer distances to a larger tertiary hospital which is under greater pressure and may have longer outpatient waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_6546">It has been agreed however that an inconsistent approach is not in the best interests of patients and therefore it has been agreed in the interim that any planned and agreed changes in referrals/catchment areas should not impact on patients who are already on a waiting list in a particular hospital or are patients in long term care/treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6547">Where, by exception, it is agreed that existing patients on a waiting list should be considered for transfer to another hospital waiting list this should be on the basis that they will be able to access their service in the new hospital earlier or at minimum no later than had they remained on the original waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_6548">Patients should be informed of any proposed changes in advance and any concerns they may raise dealt with appropriately.</p>

The new treatments have been found to be effective in treating adult patients with Hepatitis C genotype 1 infection, who have compensated liver disease and who are previously untreated, or who have failed previous therapy.

            <p eId="para_6553">Under the Health Amendment Act (No. 15 of 1996) the Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card is given to men, women and children who contracted Hepatitis C from the administration within the State of blood or blood products.  The HAA Card gives entitlements to additional health and social services, on more flexible terms and conditions than the medical card.  The HAA Card and the entitlements under it are for the lifetime of the cardholder.</p>
            <p eId="para_6554">It is the responsibility of the HSE to assess the health and social care needs of persons with Hepatitis C who are Health Amendment Act (HAA) Cardholders.  This is necessary to fulfil its duty of care to this cohort and plan services to adequately meet client needs and to ensure that a proper system of governance and accountability exists in relation to funds assigned for the purpose of service provision.  I consider that the health and well-being of people with Hepatitis C is paramount.</p>
            <p eId="para_6555">With these factors in mind, I believe that an individualised assessment of need for each person who is in receipt of these supports is needed.  While there is strong support for an assessment of need process among a number of organisations representing those with Hepatitis C, other organisations have expressed opposition to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_6556">I am anxious to move the process forward as soon as possible so that the needs of patients can be met in the most effective way.  In February of this year I reiterated my offer of an independent arbitrator to resolve the matter.  I believe that this is the fairest means of dealing with the issue and I look forward to the response of the organisations concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_6558">The Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card is given to men, women and children who contracted Hepatitis C from the administration within the State of blood or blood products.</p>
            <p eId="para_6559">Under the Health (Amendment) Act,1996 the entitlement of an individual to a HAA Card and to related services is decided by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Health Service Executive.  The CEO is bound by the definition of eligibility in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received by the Tribunal after the specified date of 20 June, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6560">A great deal of consideration has been given to the issue of recipients of Anti-D who have neither tested positive for Hepatitis C, nor had a positive Tribunal decision in their favour.  A number of women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C have experienced a variety of symptoms.  However, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Indeed some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression, are common conditions that occur in the general population.</p>
            <p eId="para_6561">It is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C.  Extending eligibility for HAA cards to those who have tested negative for Hepatitis C would have significant implications for the scheme overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_6562">I am sympathetic to the women in question, but taking account of international practice and the rationale which led to the passing of the 2006 Act, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are reasonable in the circumstances.  I will of course review any new information which becomes available in relation to this matter.</p>

There will be around 700 school-leavers in 2012, many of whom will require supports and services (this figure may reduce as individuals decide not to avail of a day placement, stay in school, or are accepted to FÁS courses).  This year disability service providers are required to cater for demographic pressures, such as new services for school-leavers and emergency residential placements, from within their existing budgets.  Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals can be responded to within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6579">The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.

            <p eId="para_6580">In relation to the therapy supports outlined in the Deputy's question, these services for adults and children are generally delivered through Primary Care Teams or community therapy services or through specialist disability providers.

            <p eId="para_6630">Under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has statutory power to set standards on safety and quality in relation to services provided by the HSE and service providers in accordance with specified Acts.  The Authority is also charged with monitoring compliance with such standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6631">HIQA published a number of standards in 2009 including the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (May 2009) which I presume the Deputy is referring to in his question.  The development of these National Standards consisted of a series of steps to ensure that they were person centred, evidence based, clear, valid, measurable and fit for purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_6632">The Authority established an internal project team that was responsible for the overall development of the Standards.  The project team conducted a comprehensive review of the available Irish and international literature and held a series of meetings with key stakeholders.  A public consultation was also held on the draft Standards.  An Advisory Group, to ensure that advice from the public and professionals contributed to the formation of the Standards, provided technical advice and provided feedback to the Authority's project team.</p>
            <p eId="para_6633">The Authority does not use a particular audit tool to evaluate the National Standards.  Rather, there are a number of international and national audit/assessment tools that can be adapted by all health and social care services to support the process of evaluating their compliance against the National Standards.  The Authority expects to see effective internal monitoring and reporting systems for the key aspects of the National Standards proportionate to the scale and complexity of the services.  This does not mean measuring everything all the time, but rather developing a portfolio of qualitative and quantitative measures to provide adequate assurance of compliance for the board, governing body or responsible clinician for the service.</p>

            <p eId="para_6635">The HSE's National Service Plan 2012 recognised that the transposition into Irish law of the Temporary Agency Work Directive would increase the unit cost of agency staffing. In the health service, agency staff have traditionally been used to meet a short-term service need or where some flexibility in staffing a service is required. In 2011, although the HSE had negotiated new agency contracts which involve lower unit costs, the use of agency staff accounted for approximately €200 million. This was accounted for in part by the usage of agency staffing to cover longer-term staffing needs.  This was not a sustainable approach and the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to significantly reducing the expenditure on agency staff usage with a target reduction of up to 50%. The Plan also contains a commitment that overtime and agency staffing are not to be used to support service levels beyond those agreed in the Plan or to substitute for staff losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6636">The HSE has been undertaking preparatory work with the agencies that are contracted to provide staff to ensure that the agencies and the HSE would be in a position to implement the legislation quickly once enacted. The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill has now been enacted and entitles agency workers to the same basic working and employment conditions, such as pay, working time, rest periods, etc. as directly employed staff with effect from 5 December 2011. Health sector employers will continue to work with the contracting agencies so that retrospective payments can be made to agency staff in a reasonable time period.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_7177">There is on-going cross-departmental cooperation on a wide range of issues, including many relating to mental health, between my Department and the two Government Departments to which the Deputy refers.  HSE services for people with eating disorders are embedded in the Community Mental Health Service and in Primary Care.  Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to the primary care practitioner with complications of their condition and early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7178">The HSE has developed a Mental Health in Primary Care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners with Dublin City University with a view to enhancing the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses, including eating disorders, within the primary care setting.  Community based Adult Mental Health Services receive referrals from Primary Care and provide assessment and treatment to individuals with eating disorders; Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams provide a similar role for their cohort of referrals.  Where the individual's psychiatric or medical needs are more acute, in-patient admission is offered within the local psychiatric services or acute medical care where necessary. The HSE also provides funding to <i>Bodywhys,</i> the national voluntary organisation supporting those with eating disorders which provides a range of support services for people affected including specific services for families and friends.  <i>Bodywhys</i>  also works closely with the Health Promotion Departments throughout the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_7179">The internet is an international and worldwide phenomenon which has no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  Therefore efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on it can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems and differing societal norms.  In this particular instance, many of the pro-eating disorder websites which the Deputy refers to may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States, and as such they would be subject to the US jurisdiction.  Any action that could be taken against them here would be limited.  While acknowledging these difficulties, it should be emphasised that there is a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers in Ireland. The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material online.</p>
            <p eId="para_7180">With regard to the regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors, the priority of the Department of Health for the foreseeable future is the statutory registration of the "conventional" therapies, through the full establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  Before statutory registration can be considered for other therapies, such as counselling and psychotherapy, there is a need for each individual therapy to federate so that it can advise, as a single voice, on professional standards.  This was a recommendation of the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_7181">The Higher Education and Training Awards Council is currently working with representatives of the professional bodies and higher education institutions that provide courses in counselling and psychotherapy, along with international experts, to determine national standards of knowledge, skill and competence to be required for the award of higher education qualifications in these fields.  While academic qualifications are not sufficient in themselves as a means of professional regulation, agreement on academic standards does form a critical building block for any modern regulatory system for professions.</p>

            <p eId="para_7188">I propose to take Questions Nos. 683 and 684 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7189">I want to offer my deepest sympathies to the family concerned.  We must never forget that this report is first and foremost about patient safety and that it all began because of the death of a patient on a trolley in a corridor adjacent to the Emergency Department.  I have just received the report and I have not had discussions with any of the groups referred to by the Deputy.  I believe however that patients in all of our acute hospitals need the assurance that this matter is being dealt with in an effective way, that lessons have been learned and that Quality Assurance Systems are being put in place across the country.  This report as an important element in driving the Health Reform Programme which is focusing on and prioritising patient safety and best governance. The HIQA report gives us a template for hospital governance as we move to the establishment of the new Hospital Groups to be established this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7190">Many changes have already happened in Tallaght Hospital and the report acknowledges this.  The practice of leaving patients waiting on trolleys for admission in a corridor adjacent to the Emergency Department was clinically unsafe and completely unacceptable. This has been stopped.  The report found that there was no clarity as to who was providing medical supervision of these patients. This is completely unacceptable. For that reason the Chief Medical Officer has referred the report to the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais to ask them to address the significant issues that arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_7191">The CEO of HIQA wrote to me last November because of her concerns about the deficits in governance and management at the hospital. As a result a new interim Board, chaired by Sir Keith Pearson was appointed last December. A new CEO is in place who is building a new management team including clinical leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_7192">Safe quality health care is a fundamental principle of the reform programme. I have approved the HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare to underpin the development of quality safe healthcare services. The National Standards also describe what capacity and capability factors service providers require to implement these Standards.  Service providers, including the private (independent) service providers, can use the National Standards as a framework to organise, manage and deliver their services safely.  It is also important to recognise that the staff of the hospital have a hugely important role in responding to the challenges ahead and in restoring and supporting this Hospital to achieve its potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_7194">I am not aware of the investigation referred to by the Deputy.  However, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the statement issued by the INMO, acknowledging and confirming the reduction by 17% overall in the numbers of people on trolleys in emergency departments in the first four months of 2012, as compared to the first four months of 2011.  This overall reduction reflects a 23% reduction in the Dublin area and a 13% reduction for the rest of the country.  This follows from a 27% reduction nationally in 2011.  Reduction of trolley numbers was a key priority initiative for the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in my Department for 2011.  Building on the achievements of 2011, and the first four months of 2012, the SDU will work with the NTPF, the HSE Clinical Programmes and hospitals to minimise patient waiting times in emergency departments further.</p>
            <p eId="para_7195">The next phase of work by the SDU will include the introduction of an Unscheduled Care Target to be introduced in 2012 and a change of focus in ED to patient journey time monitoring (in addition to trolley waits), as part of the new national score card for measuring performance, with an ultimate aim of ensuring that 95% of all attendees at EDs are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration, and that those who need to be admitted through ED wait no more than 9 hours from registration.</p>

            <p eId="para_7197">I assume that the Deputy is referring to a holder of a full licence for a car, i.e. a licence of category B.  The relevant provisions are the set out in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006).  These provide that a holder of a full licence in category B may draw a trailer where the design gross vehicle weight of the trailer does not exceed 750kg.  There is no additional test required for a full licence holder in category B to draw a trailer up to that weight.  It is also possible for a holder of a category B licence to apply for a category EB licence.  Category EB licences the holder to drive combinations of vehicles with drawing vehicle in category B and where the design gross vehicle weight of the trailer is greater than 750kg.  For a category B licence holder to obtain a category EB licence it is necessary to undergo an additional test.  It was formerly the case that a person with a category B licence had to be a learner at category EB for six months before taking the EB test.  I removed this restriction earlier this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7201">Roscommon County Council applied for a grant in respect of the swimming pool at Castlerea under the Disabled Access/Energy Upgrade initiative operated by the Department in 2011.  The Council was allocated a grant of €125,375 in respect of energy upgrade measures including variable speed drives, pool cover, wood pellet boiler and water conservation devices.  The grant allocated represented 85% of the total project costs.  The pool roof did not form part of the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_7202">One of the conditions of the allocation was that the grant had to be fully drawn down before the end of 2011.  This grant was not drawn down in 2011.  In March 2012 the Department contacted the Council seeking a progress report in relation to the project with details as to when they would expect to be in a position to draw down the grant.  This information was required in order to assess whether the Council should be granted an extension to the end-2011 deadline for the draw-down of the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_7203">Roscommon County Council did not respond to this correspondence.  The Council were recently contacted again by the Department on this matter.  The Department is still awaiting all required documentation and will assess it when it arrives.</p>

The proposed measure envisages the introduction of 6-monthly NCT testing of vehicles between 9 and 14 years old that have been part of the taxi fleet prior to the 1st of January 2009.  It is intended that over time vehicles over 9 years will exit from the fleet.

         the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011; the numbers of consultants engaged by his Department in those years; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; and the steps which have been taken to reduce the expenditure on consultancy and the reliance on consultants by his Department in these years and for the future.

            <p eId="para_7252">Details of all consultancy payments by the Department are available on my Department's website <i>www.dttas.iefeature.aspx?id=82</i>.  It is the policy of the Department in the exercise of its functions to use internal resources as far as possible. These have, when needed, been supplemented by secondments from the agencies operating under the aegis of the Department where it has been practical to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_7253">However external consultants are hired occasionally in circumstances where particular expertise is not available from either of the forgoing sources and where it is deemed to add value and independence to the overall work of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7254">My Department is constantly looking at ways to upskill internal staff to minimise the need to use external consultants.</p>
