          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Health to outline the future of Bandon Community Hospital in Cork; whether it complies with HIQA standards; if there are plans to renovate and extend the hospital in the near future; and whether funding is readily available.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the cuts to further education in budget 2013; the effect this will have on Waterford College of Further Education and teacher allocation at the college.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <from>Senator Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that the Minister for Finance would come to the House to inform us what actions he proposes to take to deal with the mortgage arrears emergency which now faces the country. I mentioned it briefly yesterday. The rhetoric has continued into today whereby the Governor of the Central Bank has been on the airwaves suggesting that the reality is that mortgage arrears are at unprecedented levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> It is now 18 months since the publication of the Keane report and its proposals. We acknowledged and welcomed some innovative proposals it contained such as split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent schemes. I gave an example in the House yesterday of acting as an intermediary for a couple where the bank is simply not interested in taking such an approach. That is hardly surprising as I learned today that since the proposals were drawn up 18 months ago, only one mortgage-to-rent scheme had come into effect as of the end of 2012. That is simply unacceptable. Only 12 split mortgages have been proposed. This is at a time when 180,000 residential mortgages are in arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">While we can talk the talk in here, other than the spin, absolutely nothing is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, was in here last week to say the Government is unhappy with the banks and their attitude to dealing with this issue. The Governor of the Central Bank stated at the weekend that many people cannot pay and that distressed mortgages were not being dealt with in sufficient numbers and that is why they are tearing out their hair. Actions speak louder than words and the Legislature supplied the tools to the banks to deal with these difficulties in an innovative way. With the sort of derivatives they designed to help us lose so much money over the last number of years, surely the same minds can come together to design a solution for those families that are suffering so much all over Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Yesterday, I gave the example that as a State we secured longer term rates and lending for our borrowing which will ease the pain of the Government and the people as we prepare future budgets. Why then can the banks not do the same? Underlying all of this fear and uncertainty for families is the reality that some of these loan books may be sold to vulture fronts, beyond the bounds of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and beyond the bounds of any interest rates in this country. People may be forced to pay higher rates and be denied the protection of normal regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> This is not a political issue because all sides of the House agree. It is three years since I started this debate from the other side of the House and Senator Healy-Eames and others who were then in opposition contributed many worthy solutions to the issue. All we have had, however, is rhetoric and no action. That is why we are calling for this amendment to the Order of Business and we hope the Minister for Finance, who has made himself available to this House so often, can come in because this is a national emergency.</p>

        <speech by="#SusanOKeeffe" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Senator Susan O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">I am sure Senator MacSharry is unhappy nothing is happening on the ground. It is like his unhappiness that nothing was happening on the ground with the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I am disappointed that the draft HSE report on the death of Savita Halappanavar has been leaked. We talked a great deal in this House about her death, its consequences and the difficulties it caused for her husband Praveen. This is yet another difficulty for him. The report could and should have been kept confidential until next week when it is due to be published. I am profoundly disappointed at the leaking of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I appreciate and applaud the fact the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is meeting his fellow Ministers in Brussels today on the horsemeat scandal. He was generous with his time before the joint committee last week. Now the story has progressed, he might find the time to come into the House. There much to discuss on this issue and there are many unanswered questions and issues to be faced in future, not least country of origin labelling, which should be brought into force even sooner than planned. Clearly there is a problem with the provenance of horses and a new system must be put in place for horsemeat traceability. We have a gold standard traceability system in this country for beef and we need as a matter of urgency to implement a similar gold standard across Europe for horsemeat. I urge the Minister to find the time to have that discussion with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I wish those people well who are perhaps trying to give up smoking today. I feel strongly about the incidence of cancer. The public consultation committee report showed that lung cancer is still the second most common cancer in Ireland, with people dying every day as a result. I wish well those who want to use Ash Wednesday as a good day to give up.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I thank the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the changes he made to the property tax, putting people those who are least able to pay in a better position.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">A week ago, the British Parliament passed legislation about gay marriage. Yesterday, the French Parliament passed similar legislation, also by an overwhelming majority. It was described as a great and noble effort by the French Minister for Justice. This was done despite the machinations of the Roman Catholic Church, which gave its premises free of charge to house people and to mount campaigns in all its churches. It was really scraping the bottom of the barrel because this squalid crusade was led by a French comedienne by the name of Frigide Barjot. It is regrettable such things should continue to happen but, unfortunately, I am used to this attitude from the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> We have recently heard about apologies to the Magdalen women, which I strongly support. I think people like myself are entitled to an apology too from the State, from the Roman Catholic Church in particular and from the Pope, who every Christmas Eve gave a message of disdain for gay people that stung and hurt so many vulnerable people throughout the world. When I say an apology, I say that in the context that some of the Magdalen women said the most bitter thing for them was that all the lovely experiences of their youth were taken from them. They were taken from people of my generation too. I have known eight people who were murdered simply because they were gay. The number of people who became addicted to alcohol and who through depression took their own lives is considerably greater. The Magdalen women described their experience as being like imprisonment. During my lifetime - I have witnessed this - people were imprisoned, they were actually placed in jail by the State because of their sexual orientation. They were actually tortured. I have dealt with people who were subjected to involuntary electroconvulsive therapy and who were fed violent chemical emetics to change their orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> We are in danger of those sorts of reactionary church forces engaging once more because they are going to lose, as the church sees it, in this battle on abortion. Gay people may once more become the scapegoat, victims of a witch hunt, and the whipping boys. That is how the church sees this. It is one down and wants to score another. It is time people stood up and said it is intolerable that people who have been murdered, tortured and imprisoned without apology in this country should once again be made the punch bag of conservative forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">I wish to raise the way the Department of Health has dealt with the medical card issue. Despite the pressures on the health services, more than 165,000 new medical cards were issued in 2012. As we sit here today, the two millionth medical card is about to be issued. The figures for 1 January 2013 indicate 1,984,000 medical cards or GP visit cards have been issued. It is an indication of how the Department and Government are dealing with the difficulties people are facing by making sure they have access to health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> There has been a lot of criticism of the Minister for Health in the past two years. It is time we had a debate to highlight the progress that has been made in that time and to examine what needs to be done over the next two years to continue to provide, maintain and improve our health service. It is important to have that debate at an early opportunity because many of the negatives are being highlighted but none of the positives. Those positives are that despite the cutbacks and the financial pressures faced by the Government, we can still provide the services people require. Long may that continue but we should have that debate so I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come in and discuss this issue and see how we can further improve value for money.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator MacSharry. Last night, in his first State of the Union address of his second term, President Obama stated the following to a joint session of Congress: "We will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union – because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs". I call on the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to use the Irish Presidency to quickly grasp this opportunity. A transatlantic free trade area offers enormous potential for companies in the United States and Europe, including Ireland. As a former Minister with responsibility for trade, I regard this as the best opportunity to come our way for some time. Ireland is in a very good position as Enterprise Ireland - it was known as An Bord Tráchtála when I was a Minister - is an excellent organisation and has a network in place in the United States. I ask that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House to tease out the potential of such an agreement. President Obama's statement that the United States is initiating talks on securing a translatlantic deal is a significant offer. A debate in the Seanad would offer the Tánaiste a great opportunity to discuss one of the most important points of President Obama's comprehensive and tremendous speech to the American people. Ireland could benefit considerably from a transatlantic trade deal and I ask the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to grasp the opportunity it presents.</p>

Perhaps Deputy Martin will come into the Seanad and apologise to the victims of the Magdalen laundries on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, rather than demanding the reverse. This Government introduced a committee to investigate the Magdalen laundries after years of inaction by the previous Fianna Fáil Government which refused to engage with the Magdalen survivors. Fianna Fáil Deputies have no intention of apologising for their party's inaction but perhaps the party's Senators will do so in this House. We have been told an apology should be forthcoming from the Government when the apology should come from the other side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I mentioned yesterday that we should have a discussion about the media and their relationship with the Garda Síochána on occasion. Leaks are not helpful to the cause of protecting the right of people to their reputation. Another area of the media that interests me is their use of opinion polls. Shakespeare once said that the Devil can cite scripture for his purpose. It often occurs to me that he can also cite opinion polls for his purpose. Groups on different sides of an argument frequently present opinion poll information in a manner that tricks members of the public. At the weekend, <i>The Irish Times</i> treated us to a story about an apparent massive surge in support for abortion. It stated that whereas only 23% of the population supported abortion in 1997, the figure had since risen to 77% or thereabouts. I took the trouble to read the relevant report in <i>The Irish Times</i> from 1997. While I do not have any quarrel with Stephen Collins, a perfectly reputable journalist who wrote last weekend's story, journalists cannot always be sure about what researchers assisting them or sub-editors and editors will do. When I checked the 1997 survey cited by <i>The Irish Times</i> at the weekend, I found that figures relating to many of the other groups who supported abortion under certain circumstances had been left out. In fact, the headline in 1997-----</p>

It is time newspapers of record examined their record and asked whether they are not in danger of losing the confidence of the public if they insist and persist in presenting information that seems to be less about informing and more about securing certain political ends.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Yesterday was a bitter-sweet day for job creation in the State, including Waterford, my home city and that of the Leader. It was a good day in that Genzyme announced a welcome and significant capital investment in its Waterford plant, cementing hundreds of jobs in the city and south east. However, it was a bad day in that a large number of job losses were announced in B&amp;Q stores across the State, including Waterford, and we also heard confirmation that 300 jobs will be lost in HMV stores.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> A number of calls have been made for a debate on job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">It would be of value to this House to have a debate on the retail sector, a debate I have called for a number of times. The evidence indicates that the retail sector in the State is struggling. This is evidenced from the job losses not alone in Waterford but across the State, the number of shops closing and the many empty premises in the high streets in the cities. Many rural shops are also closing because of the austerity policies being pursued. The retail sector has not been given the attention or focus it deserves in terms of the Government's jobs action plan. I again ask for a debate on the retail sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> I support all of the points made by Senator Norris in regard to how gay people in the State have been treated by the State and the church. As someone who fully supports gay marriage, I believe a debate on the issue would be a useful debate for this House to have.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Last night I watched "Prime Time" which explored the issue of wind energy and wind farm development, an issue in which I am deeply interested and which has been raised <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House by myself and Senator Whelan. Those Senators who watched that programme will have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of how wind farm developments affect people's lives. I was disappointed with that part of the programme last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I was also disappointed with the representatives of the Irish Wind Energy Association and Irish Farmers Association who were on the programme. They appeared to be laughing all the way to the bank in terms of the spin they are putting on this issue as regards job creation. This is big business. The wind energy sector is not concerned with how it affects people's lives. These people were not, unfortunately, challenged last night. I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to this House so that we can further discuss this issue. It is outrageous that consideration is being given to the erection in the middle of this country of more turbines than there are in the United Kingdom as a whole. There is a need for debate on this issue in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I support the call of my colleague, Senator MacSharry, for an urgent debate on the mortgage issue which I raised yesterday with the Deputy Leader. While there has been plenty of activity on the part of the Government in this regard there has been no action. Senator Coghlan hopes that the Central Bank will do the job of Government and instruct the banks to do something to help struggling mortgage holders. The banks will do only one thing, namely, strive to make a profit. Helping people is not in their remit. It is the Government's job to help struggling mortgage holders. It needs to legislate in this regard and to do so immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I call on the Leader to provide time for a debate on the issue of food and food protection for the consumer given the current scandal of the detection of horsemeat in processed food. There is also a need for discussion on the additives which, under EU law, are permitted to be included in processed foods. MSG, one of the preservatives most widely used by food producers, is known to cause obesity, which as my colleagues involved in the all-party committee which met in the Seanad will know, is one of the greatest problems facing this country. Currently, one in five Irish children under three years of age is obese and one in three adults will be obese within a number of years. </p>
          <p eId="para_52"> I note that the NATO chief has invited Ireland to co-operate on operations and the Government's invitation to a large number of people to come to Ireland to speak on greater European integration. While Catherine Day referred recently to "more Europe" rather than "federal Europe" I believe the latter is what she meant. The NATO chief now invites Ireland to collaborate. We all know what happens to collaborators.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I have heard that extracts of the report on the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, which was commissioned by the Minister for Health, will be published in today's <i>Evening Herald</i>. I understand the Minister has not yet received that report. No doubt it will make for difficult reading for Savita's family. I am sure it will contain recommendations which all of us should take seriously and consider in time rather than react to in a knee-jerk fashion, as has been the case recently in regard to the publication of other reports. We should remain calm and reflect seriously on the report into the tragic death of Ms Halappanavar.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I support Senator Kelly's remarks on wind energy. I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the House to specifically discuss the issue of renewable energy and the proposals for wind farms in the midlands. It is an issue for all of us to discuss from an economic point of view and in terms of impact on local communities. I also watched "Prime Time" last night. I have been following the debate on this issue, about which I have many concerns, as I am sure does the Minister. These concerns need to be aired in public. The Seanad is the ideal forum to do so. Issues such as, for example, whether the jobs promised will materialise need to be discussed. The Minister has also expressed concern in this regard and proposes to commission a report on the matter. It can be taken for granted that wind turbines will not be manufactured in this country as we do not have the expertise or other skills required to do so. Other countries are way ahead of us in this regard. We need to know in what areas jobs will be created and what will be the benefit to local communities and Ireland Inc. in terms of meeting our renewable energy targets in 2020. We also need to look in this regard at the UK to which we are now tied following the memorandum. It is important there is continued debate on this issue in the House.</p>

I ask the Leader to clarify with the Minister or the insurance industry if difficulties or fire as a result of faulty installation will be covered by household insurance. While one can appreciate that cash strapped householders may have availed of the services of unregistered contractors because they could do the job cheaper, they may find themselves in a difficult situation in the event of claim. This matter requires clarification by the Minister and the insurance industry. It is an issue of grave concern to those people who availed of the service of unregistered contractors. I note that while some 20,000 gas appliances were fitted in 2011, only 17,000 were fitted by registered contractors. There is a need for clarification on this issue in terms of peace of mind for householders.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I welcome the announcement this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, which appears to indicate a radical change in the manner in which public procurement will be undertaken in this country. In reality, there are far too many people in the Civil Service engaged in this practise. It appears that the Minister has the power under the Croke Park agreement to redeploy such workers. I welcome this streamlining of the public procurement process. Currently, this function is carried out by approximately 600 or 700 people, which is completely over the top. It would be more appropriate to have fewer people with the relevant expertise performing this function. Cost savings is obviously the main driver in this regard. However, there needs to be a social conscience aspect to the decision making in our public procurement process to ensure the selection of Irish producers and service providers over multinational or foreign companies, even where the cost of doing so is slightly higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Obviously, there are EU laws on the free movement of goods and services, competition, etc. No one is encouraging the breaking of the law, but we must find a way to support Irish businesses.

One factor that has often been pinpointed is the amount of alcohol consumed at home as opposed to in pubs. I had a brainwave. If one goes into a pub for a whiskey or a gin, one knows the exact measure. If it is small, the amount is 4 cl. A large one is twice that. At home, however, people have no such controls. How many of us when visiting someone's home have been prevailed upon to take a whiskey, only to find a naggin-full in our hands? We do not like refusing people.</p>

If people wanted a second drink, they would be more than welcome to get one. This is a good idea. One of the cheaper scotch whiskys used to do it via a screw-off top that was actually a British measure, which was slightly smaller than ours. Perhaps Irish distillers might take up this idea. It would be good in terms of control and could encourage people to realise the dangers of pouring large amounts of liquor at home. Naturally, the best place to drink is in the pub.</p>

          <from>Senator Pat O'Neill<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I would certainly accept an invitation to Senator O'Sullivan's house. Before I raise a matter with the Leader, I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on yesterday's announcement of changes to the community involvement scheme, CIS, and the increase in the grant from 20% to 50%, dependent on the level of cash invested by the people living on the roads in question or whether they undertake some of the work with the councils. This is the only way that some roads in rural Ireland can be surfaced. I welcome the Minister's announcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Some time ago, the Minister announced that the local improvement scheme, LIS, would be reintroduced and that the councils would have the discretion to decide how much money to invest in same from their local road funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> Will the Leader arrange a debate on yet another proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair in the past week? The 43 slots in Heathrow are at stake, do not let anyone say otherwise. Interestingly, it cost Aer Lingus nearly €10 million to fight takeover bids last year alone, and €40 million in the past three years. While Aer Lingus is in profit, these amounts constitute a loss to a private company in which the State has a stake. It is ridiculous that €40 million has been wasted. It is for the Government to decide whether Aer Lingus will be taken over in the form of the sale of State assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> We need a debate on transport, particularly air transport. Ryanair offered a three-year loan of €100 million to another company to try to get the second company into position to take over the Aer Lingus routes at Heathrow Airport. A debate would be worthwhile. The action to date has been a waste of money for Aer Lingus, never mind what Ryanair has spent.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I wish to raise an important issue that was highlighted on world epilepsy day last Monday, namely, that 50% of Ireland's population still believes that a stigma is associated with epilepsy and that one in every five people would not hire someone who suffers from epilepsy. This is a serious matter in 2013. It has to do with the perception of people with disabilities and their ability to do a job properly and professionally. The question of people's attitudes would be worth consideration as part of the public consultation process in Seanad Éireann. We should consider holding a module on attitudes and perceptions surrounding people with disabilities in the workplace. Someone who has qualified and graduated and who has the skillset to do a job should not be discriminated against because he or she has a disability with which he or she has always lived and learned to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I will not support the amendment to the Order of Business. The Minister for Finance has made himself readily available to the House numerous times. The latest was last Thursday between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., when he could easily have sent a Minister of State. No one would have argued with him had he done that. In light of his commitment to parliamentary politics and this Parliament's workings, he spent three hours in the House debating the emergency legislation. The amendment is disingenuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> That said, the issues raised are important.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">Like Senator Noone, I compliment my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on the issue of public procurement. It has been announced for some time, but 60% of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are still no registered. Today's call is to ensure that they register and are made aware of the fact of the scheme's existence.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">I do. The issue should be debated in the House as quickly as possible, since some believe that they are punching bags for conservative forces. The Senator has been ploughing a lonely furrow, but it is not as lonely now.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I stood to discuss the wind. Senator Kelly mentioned that he had watched last night's "Prime Time" programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I also watched it. Senator Kelly forgot to mention what the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, stated on the programme. We must be careful about wind. A debate is necessary, but we must also ensure that we have the facts. I am a supporter of wind energy. I do not want there to be scaremongering before all of the facts are available. Size matters in wind energy. Small may be beautiful, but the wind might not blow all of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The conference in Dublin Castle on 21 and 22 June will be a major event. It is the first time that there will be such a large open forum on this matter in Ireland. I urge everyone to become informed instead of scaremongering. As the Minister stated, a woman wrote to him - actually, I do not know if she wrote, but Senators can check what he said on television - and claimed that her hair was falling out because of fracking in Leitrim. There is no fracking in Leitrim, and there probably will not be. Scaremongering is not welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">Senator Marc MacSharry raised the question of mortgage arrears which we have discussed numerous times in recent months. I agree with him that banks are not doing enough in this regard, as the Governor of the Central Bank has made perfectly clear. More pressure will need to be placed on them, which I understand is being done by the Government and the Central Bank. I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business, as we have discussed the matter numerous times. It is an issue to which we can revert soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Senators Susan O'Keeffe and Deirdre Clune mentioned the draft HSE report.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Unfortunately, it has been leaked to the press. It is most regrettable that leaks occur on subjects as important as this one. I do not know what purpose they serve.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">It is very regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Senator Susan O'Keeffe also raised the question of requesting the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to come to the House. As the House knows, the Minister is meeting his fellow Ministers in Brussels. I agree totally with the Senator that the labelling issue which we have discussed in the House needs to be discussed again. We have wonderful traceability in this country, but it needs to be extended throughout Europe. I note the Senator's points and we will try to arrange for the Minister to come to the House as soon as he can do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> On this day, Ash Wednesday, I note the Senator's points on smoking. I hope we will have a debate on the Seanad public consultation report soon. It is an excellent report and has been recognised as such by all the people involved in it, especially the director of cancer services nationally and quite a number of organisations. It is imperative that we have a debate on it in early course.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I note the point made by Senator David Norris. He has mentioned that gay people are again becoming the punch bag for conservative forces. I can assure him that the Government will certainly be no part of these conservative forces-----</p>

          <p eId="para_97"> Senator Colm Burke has referred to the fact that almost 2 million medical cards have been issued to date. There is much good news in the health service, as well as difficulties. The Senator also mentioned the question of the value for money secured in the health service. I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister to come to the House for a debate encompassing many areas. We should have such a debate soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Senator Terry Leyden referred to the transatlantic free trade area between the European Union and the USA. I note his points in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> Senator Jimmy Harte referred to the Magdalen laundries in the context of a point made in the other House. I hope to have a debate on the Magdalen laundries next week and the Senator can make the points he raised during that debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Senator Rónán Mullen raised the question of the media, the Garda and its relationship with the media and opinion polls, the latter being only a snapshot at a particular point in time. We have had a debate on the media and media standards and perhaps we might have another some time soon. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I note the points made by Senator Paul Coghlan on the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Senator David Cullinane referred to Genzyme, a factory in Waterford, in which there are 500 jobs. The €44 million injection of capital into the company for new machines will copperfasten these 500 jobs and probably create many more. It is down to the ingenuity and productivity of the workforce in Waterford that we have had such investment by Sanofi, one of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world. </p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I note the Senator's points on the job losses in B&amp;Q and HMV which are most regrettable. We have had a number of debates on job creation, but I will ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, if he can come to the House to discuss job creation in the retail sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_104"> Senators John Kelly, Deirdre Clune and Cáit Keane raised the matter of wind energy and wind farms. I have asked the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to come to the House for such a debate, but I have not yet got a date from him as to when he can do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Senator Mark Daly raised the issues of safe food and obesity levels. These matters can be encompassed in the debate we will have on the public consultation report. </p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Regarding the points the Senator made on Europe, I am sure he will be in the House to make these points later. Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, will be here after the Order of Business and the Senator can make these points to the former Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> Senator Michael Mullins raised the issue of gas heating systems installed by non-registered contractors and referred to the need for the insurance issue to be clarified. We will try to obtain clarification for the Senator on the exact position in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I note the points made by Senators Catherine Noone and Cáit Keane on the announcement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on public procurement. The Minister of State might come to the House soon to discuss these changes with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of alcohol, including the provision of a measure with spirits sold in off-licences. I agree that that is something that should be encouraged, but as to whether we can do it, we will raise the issue with the Minister for Health and any other Minister dealing with consumer affairs to determine if such an item could be included when spirits are being sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Senator Pat O'Neill called for a debate on air transport. I will take up that matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Senator Martin Conway raised the issue that one in five employers would not hire people with epilepsy. That is very sad and I agree with him that it is to do with attitudes and people's perceptions of people with disabilities. It is an issue that should be addressed in the House and I will arrange a debate on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I welcome Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, to the House. She was a Member of this House for a long number of years and contributed greatly to debates in the past. I wish her well in her new role.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_63">
          <from> Ms Phil Prendergast<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">I thank the Cathaoirleach and colleagues. It is a pleasure to be back in familiar territory. It is comforting to be here to address the House. I thank the Leader for inviting me to address this House on a key pillar of European integration, the Internal Market, as the only Irish Member of the European Parliament who sits on the Internal Market and consumer affairs committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> While the Single Market was officially completed in 1992, two decades ago, with the aim of allowing persons, goods, services and capital to freely circulate within the Union's borders, making it work for citizens and businesses has been a work in progress ever since. Legislation has been harmonised across a vast range of areas to make sure that 20 million businesses, employing 175 million workers, can have access to a market of 500 million consumers, and beyond, and that they can compete on an equal footing with their EU counterparts with rules that are known and predictable. Likewise, their EU customers have enjoyed rights that protect them in cross-border purchases, an illustrative example of which is flight tickets.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> However, harmonising rules across the EU through legislation passed by the European Parliament and the EU Council is not enough to remove barriers to free movement and trade. In those cases when a directive is the most appropriate EU legal instrument, it has to be transposed by member states by means of statutory instruments or their equivalents. Even when EU law is laid by means of regulations, which have direct effect, these must still be properly applied and enforced and the same goes for the statutory instruments that transpose EU directives in the respective national jurisdictions. Very often, difficulties arise at member state level when it comes to enforcement, which may be lacking or inadequate, and disparate approaches to the detailed implementation between member state administrators are brought to the attention of EU institutions by citizens and businesses who have to deal with two or more jurisdictions as they try to apply the rules to their concrete cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> This means that the Oireachtas, the Government, the courts and their EU counterparts play a role in making the Internal Market a workable reality for individuals and companies that is by no means less crucial than that played by the EU institutions themselves. For this reason, I did not hesitate to accept the kind invitation to address the Seanad and I hope the current Irish Presidency of the EU will help us foster stronger ties between European and national parliamentary representatives, which are much needed at a time when the key thrusts of the response of member state governments to the crisis has been found quite lacking in democratic representation and legitimacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The Single Market is a proven driver for trade, competitiveness and economic growth, given the scale and development of the integrated area it opens up. The Irish economy has benefited very significantly from the Internal Market and has in many ways developed to tap into its potential. Not even the most ardent of the British eurosceptics I have come across has ever questioned the importance and value of the Internal Market for their economy, which is notable. On the contrary, they remain quite keen on expanding and perfecting the means by which it enables us to trade and do business across borders, even if they are missing equally important parts of the picture. That is a case of taking the cherries they like and leaving what they do not want.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Approximately two years ago, on foot of a report prepared by former Commissioner and current Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, for Commission President Barroso, on the need to relaunch the Single Market and to make it tangible for our citizens, the Commission announced a package of proposals known as the Single Market Act. Its aims were to enable us to exploit the potential of the Single Market to a fuller extent and to stimulate growth at a time of crisis, based on a number of flagship initiatives that are currently in the course of being translated into law or materialised as policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> The most important of those include access to finance for SMEs as small and medium-sized companies face difficulties securing funds to develop new products, expand and innovate. The Commission provides venture capital but common rules are needed to allow venture capital to flow across member states. They also include worker mobility - we are well acquainted with this in Ireland but only 2.5% of the active population of the EU worked elsewhere in the Union in 2009, while, at the same time, there are gaps in national labour markets in areas requiring highly qualified professionals such as health care or engineering. There are obstacles and problems with mutual recognition of qualifications that cut across member state laws, regulators and educational systems that prevent highly qualified professionals from either having access to practice elsewhere in the EU or from having their training acknowledged by the would-be host authorities. The review of the professional qualifications directive is thus being undertaken to iron out some of those differences. This is not a simple task, as different interests and priorities are at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Health care professionals are part of a special group of professional categories that enjoy automatic recognition of qualifications under the directive. Professionals who demonstrably acquired the necessary qualifications to practice according to their home member state's rules are automatically deemed apt to practice in whichever member state in which they apply to work, as the directive sets standards and core competencies that they must gain in the course of their training. In the case of health care workers, patient safety is a major concern, however, raising issues such as command of language or the need to exchange information on those professionals who have been banned from practice due to legal or disciplinary action in the home member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Both through my experience as a nurse and midwife and my engagement with regulators and professional bodies, I was mindful to put the interests of patient safety above all else when amending the initial proposal. I am pleased that we mustered enough support for an alert mechanism to immediately and automatically inform all member state authorities whenever a health care professional is temporarily or permanently barred from practising due to a disciplinary action or criminal conviction. Until now, mobile practitioners could escape through the net and practise abroad until the host authorities had reason for suspicion and proactively sought information from the authorities in his or her home country. We have now ensured that the information will automatically reach the Irish authorities and <i>vice versa</i>. This will not only guarantee safe treatment for our patients but also permanently assure our EU counterparts that our excellently trained Irish professionals are fit to practise in the hospitals and health care centres across the European continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Intellectual property is another area that the Single Market Act identified, a particular achievement in this regard being the legal framework to grant pan-EU patent protection to those businesses and entrepreneurs who wish to request it. A related topic is that of copyrights management, where much remains to be done to ensure the provision of certain contents is not fragmented and even blocked across EU borders, as is still often the case with content delivered online. A digital single market is nevertheless taking shape and we are moving forward on a number of fronts. Improved consumer confidence in online trade has been estimated as having the potential to yield as much as €2.5 billion in cross-border online transactions alone, which is a very significant amount. This is why the EU is pushing for the development of affordable and simple means to settle disputes or to obtain redress out of court that can apply to transactions across borders, including those that were made electronically. Another necessary development to shore up confidence in electronic transactions across the board will be the enactment of legislation on the mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication throughout the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">E-signatures, as we may call them, are a priority for the current Irish Presidency and I am personally involved in the process as I will lead the work of the Labour Party group in the European Parliament on this legislation, and we will have a first exchange of views on the Commission's proposal at a meeting of the Internal Market Committee on Thursday week. The process will entail a review of the e-signature directive so as to enable faster and safer identification, interaction and conclusion of transactions involving citizens, businesses and public authorities on-line.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> The reform of EU rules on public procurement rules was one of the most important strands that needed rebalancing in the interests of public authorities, workers and citizens at large. Last December, in the European Parliament, we voted through a reform of EU public procurement law that I see as a major breakthrough for workers' rights and the improvement of social and environmental conditions in Europe. Public investment in works, goods and services through tendering accounts for almost 20% of Irish and European GDP. We are talking about a fifth of our economic activity, generated through the provision of public goods in the general interest. So far, public authorities were tied down by cumbersome and inadequate procurement provisions that imposed the cheapest option on them. This "penny wise, pound foolish" approach systematically undermined other public policy goals, in the name of fair competition in the internal market. That was a huge move forward. While EU public procurement law has been pivotal in improving transparency and deterring discriminatory or outright corrupt practices in the use of public funds to procure goods and services, the provision of public welfare in a social market economy cannot be simply equated to any other business either. Many of us had been pushing to secure a majority for this legislative reform for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Contractors must respect social, environmental and labour laws, including collective bargaining and international labour conventions when they bid for public contracts. Public authorities must be empowered to exclude companies that violate such laws from calls for tenders. Likewise, subcontractors must respect the same rules, and the original contractors may be held responsible for breaches that take place further down the chain. We aim to have a clear legal toolbox at the disposal of public bodies that allows them to impose, along with cost effectiveness, social, environmental and strategic criteria in their calls for tenders. This will enable public procurement to contribute to public policy goals, taking full life-cycle costs, quality, experience and continuity into account in the assessment of tenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> We have also brought in simplified rules for social services, which often provided at a local level and by community-based NGOs. SMEs will also stand to gain from the overall simplification of the rules, the possibility to divide tenders into lots they can apply for separately as well as a facility that enables small businesses to form temporary consortia to bid for tenders. That is a hugely important element. Just because a company can storm into, for instance, the provision of elderly care or meals on wheels in a given county, claim to be able to beat any other player in terms of cost and actually deliver on it, does not necessarily mean it can do it well and truly achieve the outcomes intended by the public authority. How long will it stay there? Is it cutting corners to cut costs? Under what conditions do its staff work? What is the local know-how and community ties? These are just some of the many questions that would be ignored by awarding tenders on a cost-basis only. It is a question of humanising the element of services being bought for them and paid for by the public purse. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The present complexity of the rules crowded out smaller players without the legal and administrative resources to manage the tendering processes. It also led smaller public bodies to err on the side of caution, for the same reasons, for fear of costly legal challenges even when the legislation could have given them some leeway to choose among other prospective contractors.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Another aspect that I have also pushed strongly concerns better transparency and governance, including the protection of whistleblowers who denounce illicit practices in good faith. While I wish we had gone further in terms of the thresholds above which certain requirements kick in and in terms of other requirements, I must concede that there is a complex balance to be struck between those and the need for simpler rules for smaller actors on both sides of the tendering process.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> This brings me to mention one other important strand of the Single Market Act, albeit more general in nature. The Commission has committed to simplify and reduce the regulatory and administrative burdens imposed on SMEs, including in terms of financial reporting and accounting requirements for smaller companies. The Single Market Act package was followed up with the announcement, last October, of more legislative measures to enhance the growth potential in our continent. The Commission expects to come forward with the proposals by the end of this quarter. We need to keep doing more for consumer protection. Many of us have been pushing for universal access to basic payment accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> With increased mobility, more and more persons abroad find that the possibility to open a basic bank account is contingent on conditions they cannot fulfil given their employment or residency status. This makes many transactions we perform in the course of our daily lives, such as cashing in salaries, social entitlements, paying rent and bills more difficult or expensive for mobile students and workers, or even those who live in their own country but with such low levels of income that they are not attractive to commercial banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> When I led the Labour Party group's work on the evaluation of the consumer credit directive, we found much room for improvement on consumer credit. Consumers need to be carefully briefed on the risks they incur when taking a loan in a different currency, which is subject to interest and exchange rate variations that can become back-breaking in times of financial turmoil. EU member states have the power to extend this directive's consumer protection provisions to low-value loans, short-term loans such as payday loans, often offered on-line and by SMS. I have urged all the member states to do so as soon as possible, as increasing reports of abuse have come to my attention. The European Commission needs to keep screening lending institutions for non-compliance with their information duties. A sweep operation carried out last year found that 70% of their websites failed to include key information and had misleading presentations of costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Rules on early repayment need to be straightforward and entail reasonable fees, so as not to tie customers when they can afford to free themselves from debt. We have had situations where consumers bought goods on credit that was negotiated directly between the shop and the creditor, and when the consumers exercised their right of withdrawal they are saddled with financial penalties and fees for a loan they never negotiated or saw a penny of. This is an illegal practice that the customer must not accept. The guarantors for consumer loans should be subject to the same creditworthiness assessment as the borrowers and be fully informed of their responsibilities. Customers should be given enough time to look for alternative offers on the market when their bank notifies them of raises the interest rate for their loans. Issues such as the portability of social security and pension rights are still extremely intimidating and complex even for well informed citizens, and unforeseen obstacles can put individual workers' entitlements in jeopardy. We must streamline and simplify these rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Most importantly, I will keep fighting for strong EU legislation setting universal service obligations, to safeguard the provision of accessible and affordable essential services, such as water, health, communications, transportation or energy. A vibrant single market is indispensable for our future prosperity but quality public services are indispensable to make it sustainable. European citizens will not tolerate open markets over open borders if they become an end in themselves rather than a means to improve their existence and living conditions. For all the potential and scope for improvement the Single Market presents, it is important not to lose perspective and overestimate what can be achieved by an unbalanced focus on further liberalisation in our economies, at the expense of our social model.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> We are still reeling from very recent experiences on that front, and we saw a U-turn in the Commission's approach to financial regulation, after the heyday of the light-touch regulatory approach of the previous internal market Commissioner, a fellow countryman of ours. The Single Market is a means, a tool that has and can continue to be a driver for growth and prosperity on a continental scale. We can see it as an engine for growth but an engine cannot run without fuel or be expected to fuel itself. It can tap into and enhance the effects of whatever stimulus we inject into our economies but it will not be a source of stimulus in or by itself. If we keep suffocating the economic environment with hasty fiscal consolidation, we cannot expect the Single Market to square the circle for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I thank members for their attention and patience. The internal market cuts across EU borders and policy dimensions and many other topics could have been addressed, other than those I believe to be most important at present. I am happy to be here to answer any questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I am delighted to see Senator David Norris. I did not get a chance to give him a special mention.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">First, I welcome Ms Prendergast back to the House. It is great to have her back in the House. She played an important role here and was an active Member.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I admire the fact that, as a trained midwife, she was extraordinarily kind to one of our Members, former Senator Lisa McDonald from Wexford, who at the time had difficulty getting pairs. It was not our Chief Whip who caused problems, but our numbers were tight.

          <p eId="para_184">-----when I was appointed by the late Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, at my request, to the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for trade and marketing, with then Minister, Mr. Des O'Malley, I was delegated full responsibility for international trade and the negotiations of the Single European Act. That may not be known to Ms Prendergast but it is a fact. At the time, the then Minister, Mr. Des O'Malley, was extremely generous and forthright in signing an order which gave me full authority to negotiate that. I refer to the period 1989 to 1992. In fact, in 1992 it came into being, and in the 1990s it was very active. I had tremendous backup in Europe from our permanent staff, the ambassador and the sectoral responsibilities. All of the Departments fed in through the Department with responsibility for trade and marketing, and they fed in on everything - education, health, energy, communications. That was the way it worked; there was one lead Department. The backup of our Civil Service in Europe is second to none. It is outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I compliment the current ambassador. As Ms Prendergast will be aware, I was in Brussels the week before last. I met her for a few minutes and she was busy at her work on the day concerned. The current ambassador has been most active on the agreement reached on the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Ms Prendergast outlined her role comprehensively, and I am delighted she is in the trade area. On the Order of Business, I mentioned the significant speech by President Barack Obama last night in his State of the Union address to the Congress. It is one of the most significant statements on Europe I have heard made by an American president. He wants to create a transatlantic trade agreement between the 500 million people of the European Union and the 50 states of the United States. I raise this with Ms Prendergast as an MEP. I ask her, as an MEP representing Ireland, to make this a priority. There is a meeting on Thursday, as far as I can recall. With Ireland's Presidency of the European Council, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, now have an opportunity of leading the negotiations. These will take time. It is a complex situation, but there are enormous opportunities. I remember being a trade Minister representing Musgrave in Cork and other companies exporting to the United States of America. There are different barriers and conditions of trade in relation to sales to the United States of America, but if those were lifted and there was a transatlantic free trade area between the United States of America and Europe, it would have enormous potential for job creation and job retention, particularly because of our links with the United States of America, such as our 40 million diaspora and The Gathering this year. I was delighted when I heard President Obama's speech. It is a big step forward. It also leads in to the question of emigration and the rights of the Irish in the United States of America. That question certainly will be part and parcel of negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> It is appropriate that Ms Prendergast is here today because she is a member of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I think she is the only representative from Ireland in the area of trade and the Internal Market. It is tremendous that she can use her influence as an MEP. If she makes that to which I have referred a target until 2014, it will be a substantial achievement, and I mean that sincerely. When President Obama spoke in that regard, I felt it was one of the most important statements and the biggest opportunities that Ireland and Europe will get to compete with countries such as China and India. I thank Ms Prendergast and wish her well in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMullins" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Senator Michael Mullins<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">I join in the welcome to Ms Prendergast. I have not had the pleasure of meeting her previously but I have heard a great deal about her and her contributions to the Seanad during the years. I wish her well in her important role in Europe and on when she next goes to the electorate in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Much has been mentioned about the Single Market by Ms Prendergast. It is probably one of the most significant developments in Europe over the past number of decades. An example of the important statistics concerned is that the Single Market was originally opened to 345 million people in 1992 and it is now open to 500 million. The trade between EU countries has increased, from €800 billion in 1992 to €2.54 trillion today. One can imagine the enormous opportunities that opens up for trade. Some 20 million SMEs are operating within the Single Market. From an original 12 countries, there are now 27, and this will increase to 28 when Croatia joins.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Obviously, there is the free movement of citizens. On the benefits Ireland has achieved, Ms Prendergast brought it down to our everyday lives in that it is easier to travel for holiday, work and study within the EU. There is the free movement of goods. Delivery times and cost of transport, despite all we hear, have decreased. Obviously, the reduction of bureaucracy and paperwork makes it easy to do business. The Single European Act of 1987 gave a major boast to Ireland's economy when we were on the brink of economic disaster. Our only hope was to enhance our attractiveness as a low-cost manufacturing base inviting foreign investment and boosting local employment. We benefited a great deal at that particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The completion of the Single Market is a work in progress and is a central element of the growth agenda to address the current economic crisis. In October 2012, the European Commission adopted the Single Market Act II, putting forward 12 key actions for rapid adoption by the EU institutions. These are concentrated on four main drivers for growth - employment and confidence: integrated networks, cross-border mobility of citizens and business, the digital economy, and actions that reinforce cohesion and consumer benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> A major survey produced by the European Commission highlighted 20 main concerns of citizens within the EU, and Ms Prendergast referred to at least one or two of them. One of them is the cumbersome social security procedures that discourage citizens' mobility. Many moving from one EU country to another find it difficult to understand and make use of social security rights such as family allowances, unemployment benefits and social security. That is certainly one.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Citizens who receive health care abroad are often frustrated when they receive the bill. They find that if they have the European health insurance card, it gives them the same rights to health care and insurance throughout Europe as they enjoy at home. However, the reality is that the card gives the right to be treated as a local resident for unplanned and necessary health care during a temporary stay abroad. Many citizens moving around Europe are surprised, therefore, when they are asked to pay upfront for treatment abroad if they need not do the same at home. That is an area of concern for citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Another concern is that professionals have difficulties getting their qualifications recognised in another member state. Another is tax barriers for cross-border workers and employers. Cross-border workers who have to deal with the tax authorities of more than one country may find it difficult to attain comprehensive information on their tax status and tax liabilities. These are issues that have yet to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">We will have a satisfactory working Single Market only when many of the issues of concern to citizens are addressed throughout the EU. I wish Ms Prendergast continued success and we look forward to having her here again.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">Like everybody else I welcome Ms Prendergast back to the Seanad where she played a very active part over a number of years. It is great to see her facing us rather than with her back to me as it used to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I had the duty of being president of EuroCommerce for three years and vice president for another three years. EuroCommerce represents the 6 million shops in Europe, a sector which employs the very large number of people, 31 million. I found a constant battle between those who wanted more European control and those who believed in subsidiarity. Subsidiarity states we pass laws as close to the citizen as we can, but it is a continuous battle to avoid going the other way. To give an example, the late payments directive comes into operation next month and states public bodies should pay within 30 days but no later than 60 days. I believe the Irish are the worst in Europe in this regard so this will mean 60 days. Will Ms Prendergast comment on this? Where does it come from? How do we manage to do something about it?</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> With regard to the cost of EU legislation on small and medium enterprises in particular, as somebody who has been in business I would love to see more research done on the cost of each piece of legislation before it is implemented. Will Ms Prendergast comment on whether she believes an audit to find the cost of European Union legislation for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, would be a good idea? I believe it is a big problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Recently Angela Merkel stated the European Commission will eventually become a government, the Council of member states will become an upper chamber and the European Parliament will be more powerful, but fixing the eurozone problem is more urgent for now. She is clearly a federalist and this is what she wants to see. She states this is our objective and what we plan to do, but we will not do it just yet because we have other things to do. What are Ms Prendergast's view on this? How does she think the European Parliament would feel about it? Are we looking for more power to go to Europe? Are we looking for a united states of Europe in the years ahead? How does Ms Prendergast feel about this and how does she believe others feel about it?</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> On Monday the European Commission stated the horsemeat scandal is a labelling problem and does not represent a health issue. I do not agree. There seems to be a big problem with the way Europe labels products. In 2013, directives will be introduced in this regard which will decide on crucial rules on the labelling of food products. I would not like to see best before dates being encouraged. In my business we used to sell potatoes and the potato supplier stated if one wanted new potatoes to taste well one should eat them within three days of being picked. This meant a best before date of three days for these potatoes. Many people do not understand that best before has to do with taste and they throw away products. We have a huge food wastage problem and we can do something about it at a European level to give a direction elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Last week the European Parliament voted on a draft law which stated patients should have faster access to cheaper generic drugs. We are all happy to do this, but I am not sure where we go in this area. Only 4% of European hospitals allow people direct access to their medical records. This could come from Europe; whatever about as a directive, an example could be set with regard to access for patients to their medical records online. This would be a very useful step.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> If we discuss value for money and serving customers, we should also discuss what happens at EU level. There is austerity throughout Europe but Brussels is still dominated by thousands of highly paid mandarins. The German newspaper <i>Die Welt</i> stated this month that thousands of senior EU officials who earn a basic salary of more than €18,000 a month earn more than Angela Merkel, who earns approximately €16,000 a month. A group of net contributors to the EU, including Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, want deeper cuts in the pay of European Union officials to fit in with national austerity programmes. The President of the European Parliament stated last year he asked member states to disclose how much they pay their Brussels-based diplomats, to compare this with EU staff. He received a partial reply which he described as a series of disaggregated data. Staff at the Council and European Parliament recently went on strike in spite of their massive salaries and perks. Does Ms Prendergast agree with her fellow workers at the European Parliament going on strike, particularly given the massive amount of austerity at home? A number of EU officials have received several pay rises in recent years. At a time when practically every country in Europe is cutting back, the EU itself is expanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Kenneth Cork was a leading liquidator and wrote that he found businesses which got into trouble often had one thing in common, namely, they built a new head office, and it was a guarantee if a fountain was built in the foyer of that new head office. Will Ms Prendergast remind us whether the lovely new head office which the European Parliament has in Brussels has a fountain in the foyer? I cannot remember.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_204">It is a real pleasure for me to welcome Ms Prendergast to the House. Ms Prendergast and I served together on the Labour Party seats in opposition for some years and it was always a pleasure to work with her. Senator Leyden already referred to her professional training as a midwife. When I was pregnant and sitting here in the Chamber it was an immense relief to know a trained midwife was sitting beside me should anything have happened prematurely.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> It is a pleasure to have Ms Prendergast here in her capacity as an MEP. She is doing a huge amount of work and her comments on the Internal Market struck me, particularly her comment that even the most ardent British Eurosceptics do not dispute or challenge the existence of the Internal Market. This surely shows how embedded it has become in European culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Following on the very practical issues about the European Parliament which Senator Quinn discussed, and I am trying to recall whether there is a fountain in the foyer in the building, he made a good point on the overblown status symbols of major corporations and institutions. The House has been addressed by a number of MEPs and the difference in their type of work and that of a national parliamentarian is striking. Ms Prendergast has long experience of being a Member of the Seanad. Is the work of the European Parliament at a completely different level? Mr. Gay Mitchell referred to a parliamentary committee having to sift through 1,000 proposed amendments to a particular directive. This illustrated the highly complex and technical nature of much of the law-making at EU level and how difficult it is therefore to form a connection with citizens in member states such as Ireland. I would like to hear Ms Prendergast's take on this and whether she believes there is a way to make more of a connection between citizens and the European Parliament, or to simplify or make more accessible to people the procedures which operate in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> We are all conscious that much of the European Parliament's work is done through committees. Ms Prendergast stated she is the only Irish member of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. She also serves on a number of other committees including the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Do the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development and Internal Marketing and Consumer Protection work on food safety, which is an aspect of consumer protection, given the enormous issue which has presented at EU level through the horsemeat scandal?</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Of course, that has given rise to a whole range of jokes but is a serious matter. It is clearly now a matter that is of concern at EU level. It was the Irish food safety authorities that blew the whistle but now we have seen the implications across the EU. What can the committee do about the issue? </p>
          <p eId="para_209"> I know that the Ms Prendergast is particularly interested in the agricultural issue. Recently Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, was here and we debated the issue along with CAP and CAP reform. Ms Prendergast has pointed out that CAP reform must have a constructive impact on the Irish agricultural sector and rural way of life. I know that there is real concern among those working in agriculture, especially among farming families, about the impact of CAP reforms here. Does Ms Prendergast think they will have a constructive impact? Is there work that we can do here to ensure that happens? </p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Ms Prendergast also highlighted the rights of workers, the need to strengthen and protect workers' rights at EU level and to prevent a race to the bottom. I shall mention her work with Waterford Crystal in particular which is something that is close to my heart and family. She supported the campaign to have Waterford crystal made only in Waterford and to bring back Waterford Crystal jobs that were sadly lost in 2009. I have visited its showroom a number of times but most recently last summer. I was struck by the real ambition of its workers. The people who have been laid off from Waterford Crystal are highly skilled craftspeople. They have a great ambition to start taking on apprentices again and to grow its manufacturing business which is very small. Is there any help or assistance available at EU level that the workers in the crystal showroom can avail of? The showroom has become a major tourist attraction and has improved Waterford city centre. It has been a wonderful initiative by the Waterford City Council and the workers in the crystal company. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Ms Prendergast has also talked about connecting Munster to the EU. She is the first Munster MEP that we have had in the Chamber which is welcome. She pointed out the need to ensure the people of Munster have a strong voice in Europe. That is of interest because we have often overlooked, because of Ireland being so small, the need to ensure regional representation at EU level. What are Ms Prendergast's thoughts on regional representation? Is there a more direct way to connect the regions? Will it ensure citizens have a better connection with the EU? I know that I am running short on time.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">That goes for both of us. I wanted to address the issue of women's right, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender or LGBT rights, and the equality agenda generally at EU level. A number of progressive MEPs in the social democrat and socialist groups are gravely concerned about the drawing back of the equality agenda and the lack of progression and initiatives on furthering equality at EU level. The Irish Labour Party MEPs are 100% female - Ms Prendergast, Ms Costello and Ms Childers - but that must be unusual. Even so we see a better gender representation in the European Parliament. Is there anything more that can be done about it at EU level?</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I welcome the chair of Trinity Labour and her colleagues who are here to listen to Ms Prendergast speak. Senator Cummins, the Leader of the Seanad, had to go to a meeting. He asked me to convey his best wishes to the Ms Prendergast and to say how welcome she is here. </p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JillianVanTurnhout" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Senator Jillian van Turnhout<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_216">I thank the Acting Chairman for facilitating me and allowing me to speak. I apologise that I had to leave the Chamber briefly because I had to attend the internal meeting that also detained Senator Cummins. However, I was present for Ms Prendergast's intervention at the beginning. I welcome her.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I still feel relatively new here but the issues that I wish to mention today relate to the Single Market and the multi-annual financial framework. I want to question her specifically on those issues given her work on the Internal Market and her opening comments. As we know 2012 represented the 20th anniversary of the European Single Market. The development of the Single Market is a key priority and it is a key priority for the Irish Presidency. However, we are all very aware that it remains incomplete and Ms Prendergast mentioned where it is incomplete in her intervention. During the Single Market week held in October 2012 there was an opportunity for the private sector and citizens to engage, on a personal level, in the European policy area. I shall mention four of the areas that were raised then. Perhaps Ms Prendergast can enlighten us and share her opinions on the concerns raised. First, access to the market of a host country can be restricted by national certification or regulations that do not exist to the same extent in the home country. For me that goes against the principle of a Single Market and single area.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Second, cross-border procurement can be a problem. This is the age of electronic and online technology but many procurement procedures require a hard copy to be delivered rather than use electronic means.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Third, e-commerce is very popular at national level but it is more difficult at international level. We are very aware of the different regulations for areas such as consumer protection and data privacy and that makes things difficult. The playing field is uneven or unequal when it comes to e-commerce. </p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The fourth area related to European start-ups and that surprised me. On average, European start-ups are only entitled to half the amount of venture funding of their US counterparts. Is there a way to redress that imbalance? We must ensure that we have an even playing field between the US and the EU if we want to encourage start-ups. Ireland is extremely interested in promoting entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Many of these issues will be addressed by the Single Market Act which is in its final stages of implementation. It always seems to be problematic to reach a completed option. The adoption of the Act should be expedited because it is a job-creating opportunity for Ireland, the Irish Presidency and the EU. I would welcome Ms Prendergast's opinion on the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> As Ms Prendergast has informed us, the Commission recently introduced the Single Market Act II. To what extent does the second Act address the issues that were identified by the consultations, the four areas that I repeated here, during the Single Market week? To what extent does it fill the gaps left by the first Act? I would appreciate anything she has to share with us on that matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Last week was an interesting, exciting and challenging week for us all, both personally and stamina wise. For me the negotiations that took place in Brussels on the multi-annual financial framework at the European Council summit were extremely important and I am very aware of the Parliament's role. I am also very aware that Ms Prendergast has previously stated that the budget must do more to stimulate growth in the European economy. I know that the Parliament will be looking at the multi-annual financial framework and the proposals on the budget. I want Ms Prendergast to tell us, as a preliminary opinion, whether she supports the proposals by the European Council. Does she think they go far enough? I thank the Acting Chairman and Ms Prendergast. </p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_76">
          <from> Ms Phil Prendergast<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">Some of the questions are comprehensive and rather than be very specific and risk glossing over important questions, I shall respond to each Senator individually. I shall read the transcript from today's proceedings and give the Senators specific answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I thank Senator Leyden for his comments. A few weeks ago I was flying in one direction and he was going to another meeting in the European Parliament and it was nice to see him. As he saw from that day, there are over 7,000 people working in the building that I work in. As Senators can imagine I can only briefly go into the costs of running such an institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> We have the dichotomy of two seats. We have the official seat in Strasbourg where we must all decamp to at great cost once a month and we have the general office in Brussels. Everybody shares the view that it is a shocking waste of money having a seat in two countries and having to return home to cater to constituencies which can make work difficult. </p>
          <p eId="para_228"> As for Senator Leyden's remarks on the transatlantic trade agreement when he himself held ministerial office, he is aware that at times, systems and processes can move very slowly. Since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, I have found there are frequent opportunities in which there are assessments and reassessments of what its Members are actually doing. I sat in this Chamber when the whole area of discussion on its very future, existence, role and functions came under scrutiny, as it continues to be. Having sat here in this Chamber and now being a Member of the European Parliament, I believe there is a real opportunity for a joint process in respect of the impact in countries. Senator van Turnhout raised this point in a small way about, for instance, how legislation can be transposed across borders and on how we can work and have recognition of qualifications. I touched on that issue with regard to the professional qualifications directive. There is a huge amount going on and each MEP has his or her own committees. Incidentally, there are 12 of us from the Republic and three more from the North, although the indications are that this number is soon to be reduced to 11 Members for the Republic. In this context, it is not known whether there will be a national consistency or what division will be made on the basis of the assessment of needs. However, it looks as though Ireland might lose a seat.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Each Member sits on committees and those committees sometimes cross over, as they do in Ireland. For instance, on the issue of food labelling, which is of huge importance, the issue concerning the horsemeat will be much bigger then simply being an issue of labelling, mislabelling or sourcing. Consideration must be given to processing, to how our food is getting from farm to fork and to what happens in between. The scrutiny will be very wide and I am proud, as an MEP representing Munster and Ireland, that we can honestly claim we were not afraid to state we had found irregularities. It now appears as though it is more than irregularities and I refer to the ridiculous statement that it was DNA in the air, which cantered down and 29% of which happened to leap into one burger If Members will pardon the pun, I wonder what are the odds of that happening. While we have opened a can of worms, we must get to the nub of it and find out where we are going in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> In response to Senator Quinn, I am very respectful of his wealth of experience and the fact he was president of EuroCommerce. I always have had huge respect for the Senator's work. I can recall that back in 1994, when I was first elected as a councillor, Senator Quinn opened a branch of his supermarket chain in Clonmel that very month. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the opening because I was on holidays. I might add it is the only holiday I have had since then, but I reiterate my huge respect for the Senator. In addition, I have been watching the Senator on television and have seen how he has been turning businesses around with his wealth of experience and how he has transposed this to effect real changes for and differences to people. The Senator had some specific questions but in respect of giving him specific and proper answers, I could only gloss over them in this Chamber. Consequently, each of his questions will be addressed in person to him in respect of the present position and status. I refer to giving the Senator a proper answer that is more comprehensive than I could possibly touch on at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Senator Mullins's level of briefing on his questions shows that I have been googled. I feel as though I have been googled since he knew I was coming here. I must acknowledge this level of questioning is what I had expected. As for putting forward what we do in the European Parliament and trying to get a composite of the range of work done by Members of the European Parliament, it is very difficult to give an overview of it all and sometimes one must concentrate on just a few items. In respect of the professional qualification directive, how it was enacted and what amendments we needed to put forward, because I worked in the profession as a midwife - in which capacity I was delighted to be a source of comfort to Senator Bacik - for me there was difficulty with regard to Germany seeking a period of ten years, whereas we sought a 12-year period. This was because our nurses have a status, recognition and standard we do not wish to be diluted on foot of the introduction of a professional qualification directive. Consequently, one must be very careful and always cognisant of the law of unintended consequences or the outcome of unintended consequences whereby something one has and which is held up as being a model of what is good, right and proper does not become less than that in the general sense when we seek to have it recognised across all borders. I have no fear of making the point that Irish nurses and the training thereof is recognised worldwide and I would not like to see any dilution in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> In response to Senator Quinn, there is no fountain in the European Parliament foyer that I have ever seen. In respect of salaries and payments, the Senator is aware that occasionally, one gets flavours of some outlandish and outrageous payments. To give a general commentary, one must sometimes question the reasoning of those who run countries and systems. I must question, for instance, the reason that someone who potentially earns more than €100,000 or €200,000 would make a blanket statement stating that all graduate nurses should start working for 20% less from next Monday. That would be my particular bugbear and I have a difficulty about that. The people who work in Europe have a very hard and difficult job and for an MEP to work efficiently and effectively within their own committees, he or she must have staff who are highly capable, highly qualified and highly dependable in terms of preparing briefs, knowing what is the legislation, knowing procedure and process, as well as knowing when to intervene. I cannot over-emphasise the basis for good relations Members have with the secretariat, the committees and their own staff. In this context, I am accompanied today by Mr. Mario De Sa, who came from Brussels. I would like to express my thanks to Mario and think everyone should have a Mario, as they would be so much better off.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">Yes, a super Mario is what we have and dear Mario now is on the record of the Seanad. I am conscious of the time and acknowledge I have not answered highly specific questions. However, if I can give a point of clarification to anyone, because many points were made by the contributors, I would be happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I will revert to the question of generic drugs, which is an extremely important issue throughout my side of the country because a huge number of pharmaceutical industries are located in that region. On generic drugs, I believe there has been a cultural change in respect of how people now get their medicines and in knowing what the medication contains, as well as knowing there are cheaper alternatives. At the same time, one must take cognisance of protecting patents on a drug that would make it very profitable for the company in question. Senator Quinn also mentioned access to medical records. It already happens that all pregnant women have their records. Generally speaking, they bring their records with them and keep them with them. This is because it was thought that if a baby decides to come when one is in Roscommon, even though one is booked into a hospital elsewhere, it would be more important and relevant to have one's notes with one. However, I always am a little surprised because I have never yet seen women lose the power to speak, even if they are in labour or out of it or any other party. Another question was asked in respect of cross-border procurement and again, there is an issue about procedures and changes that happen. Sometimes a lag phase occurs between a change or directive being initiated and the Civil Service aspect of it, in respect of changing its rules, regulations and ways of doing things. Sometimes, as a result, we are a bit slower than we should be and this can create its own difficulties. However, we now are in a time of great change and consequently, the idea that this is the way in which one does things and that they are only done in that fashion must change and I believe is changing.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">Bhí mé ag éisteacht san oifig. I was listening very intently to Ms Prendergast in the office. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Fheisire de Pharlaimint na hEorpa. Is breá an rud duine dá leithéid a bheith anseo le labhairt linn.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> It is somewhat ironic that Ms Prendergast is speaking to us today as a midwife at the same time as we have had a protest of midwives in the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, outside Leinster House. It is a serious issue. I am pleased she alluded to the fact that she takes issue with what is going on. I am interested in hearing her views on the changes being introduced which appear to be draconian. Yesterday, ten new graduate contracts were terminated in Kerry General Hospital. Management is attempting to force graduates to become re-employed under the terms and conditions of the new contract. A war of attrition is going on between the Department and the INMO and student nurses.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The situation is appalling. I wonder whether it contravenes EU directives. Ms Prendergast indicated that we have the world’s best trained nurses. The students who spoke to us outside said they have no choice but to leave as they cannot afford to work for the money being offered to them. No new jobs are available. The students said it is being taken for granted that they would take a pay cut and work alongside other health professionals who might not have the same responsibilities but who would be paid more than them. I would welcome additional comments from Ms Prendergast on the issue. It is a European issue that goes to the heart of what is supposed to be the European model of equality and fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Certain statements from the EU that have been made on youth unemployment have almost diverted attention from the situation. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Eurofound, puts the overall EU cost of not integrating young people into the labour market at €150 billion per year. However, rather than investing in young people, the EU prefers to throw billions of euro at failed and failing banks. Does Ms Prendergast agree that it is just rhetoric we hear from the European Parliament and Commission on youth unemployment or is real action taking place on the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> In her opening remarks Ms Prendergast referred to the whistleblower's Bill. I note that we have had draft heads of legislation in this country also. It is important that such legislation would be introduced so that people could speak out and know they would be protected. Is Ms Prendergast aware of the draft heads of the Bill that are being prepared in this country and whether the Bill is in line with what is being considered in Europe because they should be in harmony?</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> What do Ms Prendergast's European colleagues think of the deal done on the promissory notes? Do they think we are a soft touch and that we have accepted a deal that does not involve a write-down on the bank debt, which means we will be paying interest twice a year at 3% and that we are carrying a much heavier burden than the rest of our European counterparts?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">Ms Prendergast is most welcome. I have served in the European Parliament and on the Internal Market committee. From her experience of working in Europe, what changes would Ms Prendergast like to be introduced in order to get information across on what is happening in Europe? I have been a strong advocate for the use of the Seanad. I proposed that two days a month would be set aside to deal with EU affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Ms Prendergast referred to the free movement of people and services. I wish to raise medical services and recognition of qualification. One of the problems that has arisen in this country relates to cosmetic surgery. People come from abroad to provide the service but do not have adequate insurance. I published a Bill prior to Christmas which I hope to introduce in the Seanad next Wednesday requiring all medical practitioners to have insurance. It is great to have free movement of people but that has implications for individual states.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The third issue I wish to raise relates to patents. I was nominated by the patent lawyers association, which I did not know existed until I began to seek a nomination for the Seanad. The European Patents Office is going to be moved to the UK. There is concern that if the patents office for the entire European Union is based in the UK then new research facilities for medical devices and other developments will tend to locate in the same place. Given that the UK is talking about having a referendum to withdraw from the EU, perhaps it is time to review the decision and reverse it? Ms Prendergast might not be able to give me a response on the issue today but the matter must be examined. If the UK is talking about leaving the EU why should we transfer an entire office for the registration of EU patents to the UK?</p>

          <p eId="para_252">I join in the welcome to Ms Prendergast. Our terms did not overlap but she was evidently an extremely popular Member of the House. I thank her for her address.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> I am concerned about the loss of an MEP to this country. Ms Prendergast said it has been suggested that this country would have only one constituency. That would cause concern as we have a problem with a democratic deficit in that this House might be abolished, there will be eight fewer Deputies and many local authorities are scheduled for abolition. Perhaps there is another way. Senator Bacik indicated that localities should have representatives which might not happen in the event of having one national constituency. I am interested in hearing a response to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> President Obama is most interested in free trade between the United States and the EU. There is a trade meeting in Dublin in April as part of Ireland’s Presidency. What would Ms Prendergast put on the agenda for the meeting?</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The other concern relates to the fact that the troika and the IMF have referred to the high cost of sheltered sector services in this country. Does Ms Prendergast’s work in the services Single Market give us some hope in that regard? I again welcome Ms Prendergast.</p>

          <from> Ms Phil Prendergast<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_257">I will respond to the questions posed. Otherwise, I will be less than comprehensive. I am conscious having been a Member of the House that even though at times it might seem that people are not listening I am aware that people have to attend committees. I am also extremely aware that the committees sit while the Seanad is sitting. I do not see the absence of Members as disrespectful.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I have made my views clear on the INMO. I do not agree with the termination of contracts. First, it is my considered opinion, having served on the national executive of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, having worked as a midwife for 23 years, and worked in front-line services, that the jobs graduates are filling are not new. Graduates are currently filling the positions and they are being asked to terminate contracts and return to the positions on 20% less pay. I have a fundamental problem with that. I do not agree that this is the correct way to treat nurses.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Senator Ó Clochartaigh inquired about youth unemployment. A total of 5.7 million young people are currently unemployed in Europe. Another 1.5 million work in precarious jobs. One in five of those aged between 15 and 24 years who are in the labour market are without a job. Youth unemployment rates in Spain and Greece are more than 50%. In this country, youth unemployment is 32% or 61,000 young people. Members will agree those are fairly astounding statistics. In 2005 the European Council outlined employment policy guidelines, including that in the case of young people, every unemployed person would be offered a new start before reaching six months of unemployment. Subsequently, upon review, the period was reduced to four months. By 2010 the measure had not been implemented across the EU. Therein lies the difficulty. One can come up with great ideas but achieving the reality is difficult. A youth guarantee is now in effect. That is a positive step. Of course, we need investment to avoid problems because a young unemployed person does not have the basis of experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">There is a spiral that is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it leads to poor chances and poor outcomes for them. There are aspirational issues such as reducing early school leaving, making sure there are no skill mismatches and that courses fit a person's educational standards. There have been changes in education where courses are based on continuous assessment rather than by exams in a block at the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The overwhelming response on the promissory note issue is positive. It is seen as positive for Ireland and is certainly better than what we had. It is a matter for discussion how we communicate that to our citizens and across Europe. It would be nice to take those parts we like and not take the parts we do not like but sometimes we must buy the entire package when we do not like all of its contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I feel humbled talking to Senator Colm Burke, someone who has served in the European Parliament and on the committee of which I am a member. We see the argument from both sides about how this Chamber could be given over even twice a month to European affairs. As one of the most frequent attenders at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I was devastated when it was changed to a Tuesday because everyone knows that no matter what an MEP is doing, if he or she is not in Brussels on a Tuesday, except for during the constituency week, he or she is not doing his or her job. To go on Tuesday means missing two days in effect. For us a Thursday is a better day and I was delighted to see it has been moved back to Thursday on a temporary basis, although it has been on a week where I have had votes, and once a month I go to the plenary session in Strasbourg, which MEPs cannot miss. There are also group weeks, meeting weeks, committee weeks and the Strasbourg week for plenary session, when we all vote on legislation that has been going through the system. As a Senator, I was unaware of how things worked in Europe for MEPs so we could all do with some education on people's roles. It is easy to slag off someone when we do not know what a person is doing in a particular place. This system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The recognition of qualifications and insurance were mentioned. I agree that a doctor who comes to this country to practise cosmetic surgery should have to demonstrate his or her competence in order that those availing of his or her services can be confident in his or her ability. The qualifications must be verified because anything can be made to look real on paper. The professional qualifications directive allows for a process where if someone wanted to locate to another country having demonstrated a need for his speciality, there would be a procedure in place to ensure that doctor can safely practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The idea of a British referendum on leaving the European Union was mentioned. The carry-on of the MEPs in the European Parliament is a bit sad. They continuously heckle and shout. They only go there to do that. They do not attend any committees and therefore do not do any work. That is a difficulty where someone is making a political point and not prepared to engage with the process. It is not possible to be a Senator and not be involved in the work processes of the Seanad. Equally, a person cannot be an MEP and not have the workload that goes with committees and those who are part of the team.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Any decision down the line about Britain staying within the EU gives a welcome opportunity for the entire European project to be brought into the light because it gives us an opportunity to put a focus on it. We can then see what is going on because we get both sides of the argument. It gives us the opportunity to show what MEPs do and the importance of being part of the European Union and the Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Senator Barrett asked about the loss of an MEP. It has been proposed but we do not know yet if it will happen, although it appears certain. There might not be a national constituency because that would create difficulties for elections. We will observe this with interest and will try to maintain our representation in Europe. We tend to wear the green jersey in Brussels; we are parochial. Senators serve the country and although we try to do that, we also try to look after our own areas. It is important we have the opportunity to represent people in the way they want.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I welcome Ms Prendergast back to her old stomping ground. Ms Prendergast has talked about cyberbullying and we have discussed it in the Seanad on many occasions. We were delighted to receive the report of the working group on cyberbullying. Has there been any response from Facebook about the privacy issues that were raised? Are we any clearer about the European Union's campaign being better directed? Often when we hear of a fund having millions of euro available, we wonder how to get the money to the right place so schoolchildren in Ireland, France, Spain and Germany will benefit. I am not clear how it works or how the fund is being encouraged to target that money.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> I agree with Senator Colm Burke about bringing Europe closer to all of us. I would welcome the initiative that is being rolled out in libraries in Sligo which will allow people to go into their local library, pick up the telephone and talk to someone in Brussels and ask a question about an issue they are interested in within the workings of the Union. I am sure it will take time for the programme to start but it is a great initiative. I share Senator Burke's view that we should discuss European legislation in this House. What are Ms Prendergast's views on the practicality of that? Could it be done on a two days a month basis? Can she understand why some people here might resist that or is simply that old habits die hard?</p>

          <p eId="para_269">Online gambling is No. 6 on the agenda for the meeting on 20 February of the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee. I asked Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, when he appeared before the Seanad about the potential for excessive gambling online and what procedures are in place to protect vulnerable people. Mr. Mitchell is not a member of the committee, however. An ordinary post office worker is in jail because he gambled millions of euro online that did not belong to him. Few websites have a facility in place to ensure social responsibility. Perhaps the European Union could take action in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I am delighted Ms Prendergast is before the House because she and I soldiered together in a previous Seanad. Attending a recent EU meeting in my role as a member of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I learned that the digital single market is not making as much progress as it should. If we were to get our act together in this area, we could increase gross domestic product, GDP, by 2%, which would have a major impact on the economy and level of unemployment. I ask Ms Prendergast to provide a brief report on Ireland's progress in meeting the directive on the EU digital Single Market, for example, in the area of e-signatures and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> I am greatly concerned about the youth guarantee scheme. Addressing the Seanad, Professor Christopher Pissarides stated the scheme did not offer value for money as it would provide very little for young people who are out of work. While the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, may have good intentions, the scheme could have a poor return and result in billions of euro being poured down the drain. Will Members of the European Parliament have an open mind on the scheme? We need to spend the national funds being committed to it in a manner that achieves the best return.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Anything less than an internship of six to nine months is too little, whereas I understand it is planned that the youth guarantee scheme will offer young people internships of only three to four months. Those who participate will be required to leave the scheme just as they are becoming familiar with the job or training post. The scheme is rubbish. Let us do the right thing and spend the money well. While I accept that Ms Prendergast cannot answer every question, I ask her to outline other ways in which money could be spent to help young people who are unemployed. We should not put all our eggs in one basket. </p>

          <p eId="para_279">I was merely seeking clarification. I welcome Ms Prendergast, MEP, and am grateful she chose to address the important issue of the Single Market. For too long, and especially in recent years, policy has tended to focus on macroeconomic strategy and banking stability. I am grateful, therefore, that Ms Prendergast has returned the focus to people and raised the requirement to have a more people-centred strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I am grievously concerned about the level of youth unemployment in Europe. We ignore this problem at our peril. There is little point in having well trained and educated young people who are willing to make a valuable contribution to society, the economy and our culture and community, if they are languishing on the dole queues. The level of youth unemployment in Spain, at 50%, has created a tinderbox that is waiting to explode. Youth unemployment is also a serous problem in this country. The current position whereby emigration serves as a safety valve is unsatisfactory. I have friends in Galicia in northern Spain, where people traditionally had to emigrate to Argentina. I do not know for how much longer Europe, notably Ireland, can continue to rely on emigration as an economic strategy for relieving the pressure on youth unemployment. I urge Ms Prendergast to ensure the European youth guarantee scheme for young people who are unemployed does not become an aspiration or a token gesture. Given the many billions of euro being sanctioned in the current budgetary round under the Irish Presidency, substantial funds must be allocated for the purpose of making a robust challenge to youth unemployment. </p>

          <from> Ms Phil Prendergast<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I thank Senator Susan O'Keeffe for her questions. We cannot overstate the importance of recent high profile cases involving cyberbullying. I used European safer Internet day on 5 February to call for a co-ordinated EU programme to tackle cyberbullying and an increase in funding for the European Union safer Internet programme, for which €55 million was provided between 2008 and 2013. Cyberbullying is a European problem which requires a European solution. Children across Europe are experiencing bullying online and new, more sophisticated ways of bullying are being found, for example, through Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and various other means at the disposal of young people, including some we adults do not know about.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> There is no question that we need a safer online environment for young people. The European Parliament is sometimes accused of being a talking shop. We have to put our money where our mouth is. Senator Healy Eames and I are involved in the sexual health programme in schools. In the course of talks to schoolchildren we touch on issues such as self-esteem, sexuality and bullying. For a person looking on, bullying may be so subtle that it does not appear to be bullying. Anything that causes the fracturing of a person's self-esteem can have long-term, devastating consequences. I take on board Senator O'Keeffe's comments on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Senator Cáit Keane referred to online gambling, an issue about which I am very worried. Social responsibility is needed in this regard because the system can be abused. We have had high profile cases involving individuals who had access to funds that did not belong to them. They were able to gamble these moneys and hide their gambling by means of clever accounting. This would not be the first time people have been able to hide what they were doing using clever accounting or by cooking the books. Online gambling is a cause of great concern. Procedures should be in place to flag when a certain amount of money has been spent. People sometimes enter what is almost a trance-like state as they become lost in the attractiveness of what is presented to them online. The comfort of their physical environment, as they sit in their armchair in front of their personal computer in their comfortable little world, can have devastating consequences for families and society. This is a societal problem that has become highly visible. </p>
          <p eId="para_284"> On the European youth guarantee scheme, a couple of weeks ago a young person expressed a view to me that the scheme would not have any effect on youth unemployment, especially in Ireland, and asked what policies, if any, would be introduced to curb youth unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The reason somebody so young would be so cynical is because we do not have great models to which we can point as having been successful. However, one must start somewhere. In trying to meet the needs of many, a good intention can be diluted by many other good intentions, to which sufficient resources are not given because of attempts to cover too many areas with too thin a veil. When we do this, inevitably things fall through the cracks. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> The European Commission announcement in December of a youth unemployment package, previously known as the youth guarantee, was a positive sign of acknowledgement by the EU institutions of the extremely serious youth unemployment problem. As I stated, youth unemployment in Greece and Spain is estimated to be more than 50% and is 32% in Ireland. There are currently 51,000 young people in Ireland who are unemployed. The affects of unemployment on younger people are longer term because there is a cut-off point, in terms of age, at which employers are willing to give them a start as they may believe there is something wrong with a person because he or she has not worked previously. There is a need for a societal change in terms of how people who become long term unemployed are viewed. </p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Since I took up office, my colleagues and I in the Labour group of the European Parliament have been arguing for a focus on growth and employment needs in Ireland and Europe. What is required is a shift from the front loading of austerity measures to real investment. I agree with Senator Healy Eames that anything less than six or nine months participation in a scheme is unsatisfactory. The fact that people take part in such initiatives should be viewed as a positive and as a step at a time when we are in crisis. We are trying to do something about it. While currently a person can take up an internship for nine months, it may now be necessary to reduce this to six months. There is so much to do and doing even a small amount is better than doing nothing. We may need to adjust our viewpoints. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> I agree that there is not enough money to do everything we want to do, that people are often frustrated because of this and end up doing something for the sake of it. During the course of the next seven years €6 billion will be spent on youth employment initiatives across Europe. That is not to be sniffed at. Ireland should get its share of that funding. We will make sure that people are aware of what is on offer and how it can be accessed and drawn down.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, to the House. There was a good Second Stage debate on this Bill last week and I have some suggestions to make to the Minister of State, in the hope that he may find them useful in bringing forward the Bill. Members are aware this is an important issue and that investment in education, research and human capital is part of how the economy grows, which in turn enriches the rest of society. This is not merely about markets but is about people having the funds to do many other things. Members are aware that part of the problem being encountered has been the necessity to set aside so many projects because the State has run out of funds because of difficulties in other areas. There is research indicating that in modern economies, probably two thirds of growth is due to improvements in human capital and not to physical capital. Consequently, improving the quality of people, the work they do, the education they receive, the research they carry out and the new products and innovations they develop all are goals to which Members aspire and which the Government has reassessed in the framework of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Members also must take account of the fact that things did go very wrong, albeit not necessarily in this area, but the implications for this area of things going wrong elsewhere are serious. Funds are not unlimited and when investigating this sector, an bord snip nua found it very difficult to get statements of outputs from those who were spending large amounts of money. Between them, I believe the first and second strategic innovation funds encompassed approximately €140 million. This was a very large budget and an bord snip nua's complaint was the system used to administer it did not measure the outputs to the wider society as a whole. Colm McCarthy's complaint regarding this group was that the main evidence of activity and output with which he was presented was the number of refereed articles but he sought something broader. I believe this is the reason changes were undertaken by the Government in Science Foundation Ireland to concentrate on the 14 strategic areas. As the Minister of State is aware, there were also complaints by the Committee of Public Accounts, as well as some fairly arduous sessions between the heads of universities and the members of the aforementioned committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> This seems to reflect a growth in bureaucracy and managerialism as well as, one might say, a loss of perspective on what this budget is supposed to be about. I perceive it primarily as relating to how this sector looks after the next generation. Consequently, one point I will be addressing is that any use of research money from this foundation or any other foundation to "buy out lecturing" strikes me as appalling. In the Trinity College Dublin to which I went, the senior people made it an absolutely vital essential that they saw every single first-year student. They went into the Edmund Burke Theatre and lectured to 400 people. They did not regard themselves as being any kind of elite, which had distanced itself from the group it was supposed to serve because after all, the latter are the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists, mathematicians and so on. I actually received documents stating one could use this money to "buy out lecturing". Needless to say, I refused, on the grounds that the reason I went there was to give lectures. However, such a mentality was abroad at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> Consequently, in the light of the straitened circumstances of the national finances, the urgency of dealing with the serious growth in unemployment and debt and household debt and so on, this budget must become more focused and I commend the Minister of State in this regard. Moreover, lessons can be learned from some of the faults to which I have referred, as found out by an bord snip nua. I believe they found approximately 70 people in TCD and UCD, in receipt of an average salary of €80,000, who were administering research budgets. They were not giving lectures or conducting research but were filling in forms about people conducting research. It is a question of what can be done to reduce this and put the money to use elsewhere. I believe the well known slogan in this area, "More scholar per dollar", will appeal to the Minister of State. I will investigate what the euro version of that slogan should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> An evaluation of the strategic innovation fund was conducted, a lot of money was spent, about which an bord snip nua was particularly caustic. It is important to direct money towards where one can show definite results. One of the measures of results, namely, what is the income of the funding bodies, that is, the universities in terms of patents, royalties and research income apart from the grants from the Government, is actually minuscule. In many cases, it would compare with just a handful of undergraduates. Consequently, the State has been spending a lot of money and it is not insulting the scientific profession to state one would like to see some measure of output and some measure of results.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> Obviously, those who were excluded do not like the Government's concentration on the 14 areas. It has been said to me that this is akin to taking last year's successful racehorse results, going to the races in five years' time and betting on the same horses on the assumption that things may happen. I am uncertain whether this analogy is correct, given all that has happened in the horse business, but using previous experience to project the future has its hazards. One suggestion I have made is the Government should keep some funding open and run approximately 20%, or whatever percentage the Minister of State might decide, against the 14 areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">That would be important if something entirely novel outside the 14 areas looks good. In addition, there should be a limit on the 14. I have suggested that it might be a rolling 14. One would expect two or three of them to drop out each year and we could put in others so that we are not stuck with an outdated portfolio of projects or researchers who believe that the research is, to use the current phrase, of indefinite duration. In view of the amount of bureaucracy involved, and the need to cut it, I propose in the amendment to bring in people from the fields themselves. I listed learned societies. That is important as there is a huge industry called university and bureaucratic politics but it does not do anything. We want to get to the research and to the lecturer and we want to connect the two again.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> All of this must relate to the next generation and what is happening in teacher training. As the Minister of State is aware, he and I have a cause in common, namely, what is happening in mathematics in this country. If we are interested in the next generation of scholars and researchers, there must be connections. I have some concerns that the current reconfiguration of teacher training is not going the Finnish route, which as I understand it is that a person teaching a subject such as science, mathematics or technology – the areas covered by the Bill – should have a masters degree in the subject. We seem to have gone in the opposite direction in that teacher training is not connected to the academic departments in which mathematics, sciences and languages are being taught but is moved to a separate enclave. That disconnect could be serious because the Minister of State is seeking, and we are supporting him, to get a solid foundation for science. For example, to be a mathematics teacher it would be eminently desirable that one would have attended all of the mathematics lectures right up to masters level with other people learning mathematics as well. The idea that there is an inferior or baby mathematics for people who become teachers totally understates the importance of primary and second level in building up the capacity that is being sought in the legislation, which we support.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Some of the comments by employers and employer bodies that they do not much like the look of some of the graduates is a legitimate statement. In the United States that would be dealt with by philanthropy. The corporations which felt there was a need to help promote mathematics would provide money to endow a number of sizarships and fellowships because it would be in the broad national interest. I tend to discount statements by wealthy industrialists paying low rates of corporate tax and blaming universities for not doing what they would like. They should become involved. I am sure the funds officers of all of the colleges would be delighted for multinationals and Irish industry to assist in this vital national need.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> It is important the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and perhaps the Department of Finance, is involved in evaluating outcomes. This reform is vital because it is not just in this area we threw funds at initiatives and never bothered to measure whether there was any return. That cannot continue in the era of promissory notes and subsequent to it. It is necessary to develop those kinds of models because value for money is more important than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> There was a certain exclusivity in the way we approached the issue in the past in that only science, technology, engineering and mathematics were important. Mathematics dropped off the radar. Some branches of science are annoyed at being excluded. The knowledge economy excluded a significant part of the knowledge one would find in any good university, so there was elitism in that regard. One could say that part of the ingredients of the progress of the country and the economy in the future will involve mathematics, basic economics for senior public servants and even more basic economics for people in banking. We must also address language deficiencies in terms of doing business outside the English-speaking world. Those subjects do not cost much money but they are a vital part of knowledge. That is the reason I have tabled an amendment on wider knowledge. We should not be so arrogant that only three subjects could possibly be endowed with research funds on the basis of their contribution to economic growth. It is important to remember that simple things could also be done which are attractive in the case of an Exchequer in our situation. We could undertake simple tasks that would improve the overall competitiveness of the economy and not define knowledge so narrowly.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I gather from my science friends that one of the excluded subjects is botany. That sounds like a remote academic subject but our late friend and colleague, Shane McEntee, was trying to cope with the damage caused to trees in this country by imported diseases, in particular, ash dieback disease, which is ten times more serious than the problem with Dutch elm disease. Botany is not included in one of the 14 priority areas but, in time, if the Minister of State has some flexibility, I urge him to include botany to save the forests of this country because they could be valuable to the landscape. Perhaps we could develop an industry based on our distance from places where they do have tree diseases. We could develop an industry around the export of healthy plants. Many scientists feel left out from access to the funds. Others in academe feel left out as well. In the wider national interest, those who do get the money should be able to show the Minister of State and the House the returns. Heretofore, the policy appears to have been very much kicking in hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 18 have been grouped together. In the light of what I have said, it is probably somewhat self-indulgent but I hate the word “strategic”. It is a Greek military word and the definition according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> includes demoralising the opposition. It means nothing. If it means important, let us call it important but it is typically used to give somebody a fancy title over the person who will actually do the work. As it means nothing I suggest that it would be dropped from all Government documents. I will not push the point any further. It is meaningless, self-important and managerialist, and is nothing to do with the world of learning. In the world of learning one either impresses people by one’s ideas or one does not. Calling oneself “strategic” does not mean anything. One person I knew in an Irish university was called the director of strategic innovation. His nickname was “Disi” based on putting the initials together. Strategic is a pointless word that university heads love and it means nothing to those who do the work. I will not press the amendments. It is a mere suggestion to improve the nomenclature.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to reintroduce the conversation between the Minister of State and me on this topic but I will not press the three amendments, Nos. 1, 3 and 18, unless someone else has strong views about the word “strategic”.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_307">I thank the Senator. I will respond in general to some of the points raised by him.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">His points are valid and we are conscious of them because we want to ensure we have the best research landscape in the world. That is our ambition and with the meagre resources we have, given we are borrowing €300 million per week, we want to prioritise. I take the Senator's point on the word "strategic" but the sense of the word for the purpose of this legislation is that we have a strategy that is mapped out through the national research prioritisation exercise. The steering group has reported on 14 key areas the State will fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> That is not the end. The State's resources that are applied to this are a portion of the overall spend on research and innovation. We need to have context. The HEA block grant is €1.02 billion and research prioritisation amounts to €440 million. There are other research funders through private enterprise and entities such as the Health Research Board, Teagasc and the IRC. If we send a signal about this legislation to the research community, it must say that in times of economic constraint, we have built up the capacity in recent years and now we want to sharpen the focus. That does not mean that botanists, for instance, cannot be funded within the Irish landscape. It is not true to say that if they are not within research prioritisation, they will not be funded. It is unfair for anyone to make that assumption. There are imaginative ways where if people can prove an economic or social impact, and there are clear metrics set out by SFI in the area, I see no reason that area of research cannot be funded. If a project does not fit into prioritisation, it does not mean the area will be an outlier in the system. Talking of mathematics, which underpins all of the best science, there is no reason that mathematicians cannot map on to the prioritisation exercise. There is a mechanism for them to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> We are thinking long term and in terms of the next generation. We want to come up with a research infrastructure to ensure that we can attract the sort of world class researchers who are so necessary for the system we have and to measure up to that excellence and have a long-term goal of excellence. This legislation is part of that process and is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> There is within the prioritisation exercise a clear pathway to measuring outputs. We are in the midst of completing a metrics paper with the assistance of Forfás, which I thank for its work so far, that will measure outputs and impact. It is important to measure on behalf of the taxpayer where funding is being funnelled and the impact it is having. That process is ongoing and I am conscious of the Senator's point.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I also agree with the Senator about the role of industry. Sometimes we get stark messages from industry but we are engaged in a process whereby we are putting together a group of people, some from the HEI and some from industry, in order that we can map out what is happening in the stem cell area. There are two aspects to that. We must ensure we have the continuing professional development that is so vital at primary and secondary level so we have the through-put into the tertiary education sphere. We also must ensure that where disparate initiatives are taking place in industry, if there is a way to map them, we will do so to see how they can be replicated across the system. Every child at primary and post-primary level should have access to that industrial engagement in the area of promoting science, technology, engineering and maths.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> All of this inhabits the educational sphere. Regarding the legislation, section 3 will insert a definition of "applied research" and define "strategic areas of opportunity for the State which shall be construed in accordance with section 7(6). "Applied research" means original investigation undertaken to acquire new knowledge directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective. Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications. This amendment is necessary to enable Science Foundation Ireland to support applied research, as well as continuing to support oriented basic research.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> The other amendment to section 3 will help to refocus the foundation's efforts in areas of opportunity by adding the term "strategic areas of opportunity for the State". This revised definition relates to the revision of Science Foundation Ireland's functions provided for in section 4. The amendment relating to strategic areas of opportunity will allow for Science Foundation Ireland to realign its programme portfolio in line with the recommendations arising from the national research prioritisation steering group, which was chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure. To support these priority areas on the basis of existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities in the global market place and those most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and, ultimately, jobs, the Government approved the recommendations arising from the group's recommendations. The aim is to align the majority of public STI investment with 14 areas of opportunity identified in the report, as well as the underpinning technologies and infrastructure. The report also acknowledged the important role of research for policy and research for knowledge, and recommended the remaining funding be channelled to support these two areas. A number of measures were also recommended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the STI system. It is in the context that the Bill provides for the refocusing of the research themes to be funded by the SFI towards the priority areas of opportunity.</p>

I have proposed to delete the words "in the State" and insert the phrase "and learned societies". I displayed some prejudice, if one likes, in this regard earlier. There are too many statutory bodies. Learned societies are where knowledge is located. I have two such societies in mind, namely, the Royal Irish Academy and Royal Dublin Society. As an bord snip nua showed, bureaucracy in this area is a problem rather than the solution. The point I seek to incorporate in my amendment is that collaboration between different brands of bureaucrats differs from collaboration between different brands of scholars. </p>

          <p eId="para_335">I do not support the amendments. The main purpose of section 7(1)(<i>e</i>) is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to research among bodies in the State by extending the scope of Science Foundation Ireland's consultation to bodies anywhere. The amendment would dilute this purpose and could increase costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> On amendment No. 13, Science Foundation Ireland's objective is, as set out in the legislation, to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State. It is funded by the State through the Department's Vote. The purpose of the power of the Minister to issue directions to Science Foundation Ireland is to specify particular actions relating to the carrying out by the foundation of its functions in line with these objectives and ensure public funding is used in accordance with these objectives. Allowing external bodies to influence these policy directions would not be appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I note Senator Barrett's reference to consultations with learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and Royal Dublin Society. While I do not wish to be facetious, there are a number of learned societies, including many with the designation "Royal". This long list includes the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal Geological Society of Ireland, the Zoological Society of Ireland, Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Honorable Society of King's Inns, the Irish Association of Physicists in Medicines, the Irish Recorded Music Association and the Irish Texts Society. While I am aware the Senator is not being prescriptive, the role of determining science policy is predicated on a stakeholder engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Last year the Royal Irish Academy hosted a good seminar on prioritisation and its impacts. The Irish Research Council has a strong role in the humanities and social sciences. In shaping any new strategy on science, technology and innovation, I must have a clear vision, following the prioritisation exercise, that proceeding with a new strategy for the country requires a clear role for the higher education institutes and all funders of research in the Irish landscape. We must also pay due regard to the institutions to which the Senator referred. However, for the reasons I have outlined, we should not be prescriptive in terms of how Science Foundation Ireland conducts its business given that the prioritisation is only one proportion of expenditure on research in the country as a whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">We should thank the Royal Dublin Society for the use of this hall, which it left us in 1924. My concern from my own area is that none of the insiders, quangos and bureaucrats had ever heard of Morgan Kelly in University College Dublin. There are people outside this insider circle who know a great deal and it is a shame to have them excluded. In the area of transport in which I operate, for example, there is a major disparity between outsiders and insiders. The people on the inside never consult those who might disagree with them and there have been many examples of this in recent times. Why is the bureaucrat sector afraid to consult? If Morgan Kelly had been listened to, we could be expanding the budget for science and technology today.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> We have an insider-outsider model in the academic and research communities. It would be good to ferment some ideas of the kind I have mentioned. I note the Minister of State took my point. Wisdom is available in places other than State boards, quangos and the ranks of bureaucracy. The critics of bureaucracy will argue that it will always expand and look after itself. Hence the benchmarking of public sector pay before the recession. How would the bureaucrats like to do something for the country? On the question of whether to join the euro, most of those on the outside, including the then British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, argued that one should read the small print. He did so and Britain did not join the single currency. </p>
          <p eId="para_341">The insider people in Ireland joined, which is also part of our troubles. Knowledge is not exclusive. We should always try to be inclusive of all people, which is the purpose of this amendment. I note that the Minister of State proposes to spread the net on Report Stage. Who knows, the insiders might actually be entertained and enlightened by consulting more widely. I wish those in economics had done so.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I am not sure I agree with the points made by the Senator. This process on prioritisation and this legislation is not about propagating a system, rather it is about creating a new system. The legislation is designed in the first instance to create more jobs and in the second to create a system of knowledge that can be supported. It is eminently sensible that the Government via the taxpayer would prioritise those areas. There are a number of institutions relating to the research landscape in this country, for example, transport, as mentioned by the Senator. It is not true to say that the transport community was not in some way, shape or form consulted in the research prioritisation exercise. For example, the core issue in respect of priority area K, which relates to smart grids and smart cities, is transport in larger urban conurbations such as Dublin, Cork or Limerick. Work in the research community around these challenges is ongoing. There is no reason the discipline of economics cannot map onto any area of the research landscape. It is for the economists who are housed within the individual higher education institutions to think more laterally about how they can engage with other entities and research clusters in terms of the creation of an impact around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> What we are trying to do is to force the breakdown of silos from an interdepartmental point of view. For instance, we have had some measure of success through the creation of a health innovation hub in Cork. There is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on how to push further innovation through that demonstrator model. Ireland is a small community and it is now time for people who traditionally operated within their own landscapes or silos to consider how they can collaborate and create new areas of opportunity in terms of how they carry out their research. There is nothing preventing them doing so. </p>
          <p eId="para_344"> Science Foundation Ireland provides opportunities in its output statement for people across the research landscape. Where good ideas, which potentially have an economic and societal impact become apparent, there will be a mechanism for them. It is for the researchers to start thinking more laterally about how they engage. There is a challenge for researchers within the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">The Minister of State and I share much in common on this issue. Section 4(1)(<i>f) </i>states: "devise, administer, allocate, monitor and evaluate, schemes, grants, and other financial facilities.....". The amendment seeks the addition after "facilities" of the words "in a cost effective manner". The Minister of State will know from the reflections of an bord snip nua and the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue that this has not been the case. This is also evident from a survey carried out in Trinity College Dublin on restructuring, which has nothing to do with lecturing. In response to a question in that survey on whether restructuring had given people more time for research, one person agreed, 17 indicated no change, 102 disagreed and 86 strongly disagreed. A great deal of money is being spent on projects from which there is no result. </p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The addition of "in a cost effective manner" might be useful to the Minister of State in terms of his preventing the recurrence of a scheme in respect of which the number of people who thought it to be useless outweighed the number who thought it freed up more time for research. However, the Minister of State might be of the view that he already has sufficient powers to address that type of problem. There is a need for stricter monitoring in this area. That the number of people who strongly disagreed that the aforementioned restructuring was of any benefit versus the number of people who believed it was of any benefit was 188:1 is shocking.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">It is clear that research is delivering. More and more of our foreign direct investment wins are predicated on the research and development infrastructure available in this country. The Irish medical devices sector is ranked ninth of ten in the world. The number of social media and ICT related companies located here and the performance of our research and development sector during the past decade has had a significant impact on the economy. As part of the national research prioritisation exercise, which involves all State funders of research coming together, we must now measure that impact, which is vital in terms of ensuring transparency for the taxpayer in the context of the research we chose to fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">Under amendment No. 10, the funds could not be used to buy out lecturing. It is vital that our scientists, engineers and academics perform their duty to this country's 18-22 year olds. The real reason that taxpayers stump up this money is their hope that their children will attend these institutions. I am appalled by any suggested use of the funds to buy out lecturing. I have received documents to that effect. Perhaps the Minister of State can informally state that this is a purpose for which the money will not be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Like the E. T. S. Walton case, lecturing is the valuable part, but too many senior figures in Irish universities have opted out of lecturing and do not know anything about 18-22 year olds. They comprise a bureaucratic cabal. Creating a second cabal of high-class researchers who would not need to give lectures anymore because they had money would be self-defeating for the country and annoying for the taxpayers who provided that money. The Minister might keep this practice under review with a view to ensuring it does not occur in future following moneys Voted by him through this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">In March 2012 the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation transferred responsibility for delivery of the discover science and engineering, DSE, programme from Forfás to Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, on an administrative basis. Since its establishment in 2003, the programme has been actively working with companies and higher education institutions as well as representative bodies, such as Engineers Ireland, to heighten awareness of science and engineering and to raise the level of student uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level. The programme also runs a range of science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, initiatives at primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The objective of the DSE programme is to promote awareness and understanding of the importance of STEM, to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics, to promote a positive attitude to careers in STEM and to foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics and their value to Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> There are many synergies and mutual complementarities between the programme and SFI, particularly in the light of the outreach programmes run through SFI-funded research centres. The transfer underpinned by this Bill will enable synergies between the programme and SFI funding to be maximised, will increase the programme's impact and will further enhance SFI's science outreach activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Including subparagraph (iii) of amendment No. 12 would be superfluous, as specifying in legislation the recipients of funding through SFI's awareness programmes is unnecessary. If only certain potential recipients of funding were identified, it would raise questions as to the eligibility of other bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> We can accept subparagraph (iv) of the amendment in principle. I agree that it would be appropriate for SFI to consult, as appropriate, the Department of Education and Skills where SFI's activities in an area are relevant to that Department. However, I propose to insert the amendment in subparagraph (i), as set out in amendment No. 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Subaragraph (v) appears to dilute the Bill's objective of enabling SFI to support STEM awareness. It also may go beyond the scope of SFI's function.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">I move amendment No. 12:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_367">In page 4, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_368">"(iii) the activities in subparagraph (ii) by programmes in teacher training colleges, and in first and second level schools,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_369">(iv) the Minister for Education and Skills on these matters, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_370">(v) the enhancement in society as a whole of knowledge and learning including, but not confined to, science, technology, engineering and mathematics,".</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We agree on the middle part. That is positive. It is difficult to comprehend that we have a problem with mathematics at primary level. I believed it to be a case of úll agus úll eile and adding the number of úlla.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> We have a serious problem at second level, in that some estimates by the Royal Irish Academy, RIA, suggest that up to 80% of mathematics classes at second level are taught by people with no qualifications in the subject. This provides a considerable advantage to those who have qualified maths teachers and can attend grinds schools. As we have discussed several times, bonus points for mathematics have missed the point.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The Minister of State's officials should feed into this and ensure that it is not just once per year that we all attend the RDS for a big science exhibition. No matter how young a person is, he or she should be taught by qualified science and maths teachers. Rural science was a subject prior to emphasis being placed on reviving the Irish language in the 1920s. My grandfather was a school teacher who taught it. What happened to it was a shame.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> We can do a great deal at fourth level and something at third level, which is under discussion in this Bill, but if we cannot enthuse teachers at first level and acquaint them with the subject, we should change the entry system to the higher diploma in education to ensure mathematics teachers have appropriate qualifications. The current crop of pupils are pretty sharp on the uptake and can quickly discover which teachers have a qualification in the subject in question. I gather that the most popular teacher is the English teacher, given the significant traditions in that subject, for example, Brendan Kennelly, Seán O'Casey and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> What the Minister of State is attempting to do at the top level is a difficult task if the foundations - we have returned to that word - are not secure. Can SFI ask schools of education in universities to address the problems of trying to inculcate the gospel, as it were? It is not just PR. Rather, it is about teachers who can use their knowledge to enthuse students.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> I will withdraw amendment No. 12. It is excellent that the Minister of State has accepted the middle paragraph but I tabled the others in the spirit of helping him to develop this area. If it is done in isolation from teacher training, the task of achieving the goals that we all share will be made many times more difficult.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed by the Senator. It is important to state for the record that the Department has, via a tender won by the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSTL, out of the University of Limerick and NUIG, spent more than €2 million in the past year through a professional diploma, which is being delivered as we speak, for out-of-field maths teachers. There is a clear recognition by the Department of the need to ensure that we have a coterie of teachers who are properly skilled in STEM.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> I refer briefly to the recent TIMMS and PIRLS results, which mapped out literacy, numeracy and scientific skills among a fourth class coterie at primary school level. Those results clearly show that in the area of literacy we are doing very well and that we are above average in the areas of mathematics and science, but my vision is that we could do much better. My personal vision is that I would like to see the teacher education colleges - which are going through a restructuring process, which is ongoing at higher education level - devise programmes with master's in STEM education or STEM advocates which could be created at primary school level, perhaps at district level. We could engage, for instance, the people who roll out SciFest. I take the point that was made that there is an annual pilgrimage to the RDS and the Young Scientist Exhibition has done marvellous work in raising the people's consciousness about science but there are other players in that field such as SciFest. This is where industry has a role to play in raising awareness and consciousness around the need to ensure we have advocates for science at primary level. We need to start thinking of more long-term objectives as well, instead of the five-year electoral cycles. My vision is that we move into five-year, ten-year and 15-year horizons. If we start to look at primary school now in terms of the way STEM education is taught, we will see the long-term results of that in due course. We are conscious of this but for the purposes of this amendment, technically speaking, this is in the area of education and would be done through the higher education strategy, which is a function of the Department of Education and Skills. It is in that context, although I agree with the sentiments expressed, that I would not be in a position to accept the amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I state for the purposes of the record that SFI's objective is as set out in the legislation, to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State. It is funded by the State through the Department's Vote. The power of the Minister to issue directions is for the purpose of specifying particular actions related to the carrying out by SFI of its function in line with these objectives and to ensure that public funding is used in accordance with these objectives. Allowing external bodies to influence these policy directions would not be appropriate. I agree with the sentiments of the amendment but for the purposes of this legislation and in terms of changing or evolving the remit of SFI, I would not be in a position to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">The presentation of the wording that "The Foundation shall comply with any direction referred in subsection (3)." is stark in the Bill. If a decentralisation policy or some other policy was put forward we could not say that would not happen under this Minister because he comes to the House, discusses ideas and we have an interesting debate. Does the wording as it stands give the Minister too much power to order a science foundation around? The wording that "The foundation shall comply with any direction", is stark. The Minister could say that he wants the foundation to give the entire funds to Professor Bloggs in XYZ university. Does the Minister of State consider the wording to be draconian? It was on that basis I tabled the amendment. We had that before and ministerial directions led to many strange results in many fields. The wording is very strong. It almost assumes that the people in the foundation would not know much and that the Minister would have to direct them to do things. I will leave it at that for the Minister's consideration. That was the point I had in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">I addressed this point in my last intervention where I spoke about the power of the Minister to issue directions. That is for the purpose of specifying particular actions. The directions relate to general policy. I do not think that we are being in any way draconian in that sense. There is a strong culture in this country of successive Governments, regardless of their political hue, having endeavoured to engage with stakeholders in this area. I point to the evidence of the research prioritisation steering group where we asked Mr. Jim O'Hara to chair that process. We brought in all the State's funders of research and those in industry and academia - a myriad of people involved in this area. We try to arrive at the best policy outcomes through a process of stakeholder engagement. It is important to state the powers of the Minister given the democratic mandate that he or she or the Government has. It is not heavy-handed or draconian to state SFI is funded through the Department's Vote and, in that sense, must be directed ultimately by the will of the people. Therefore, I would not support the acceptance of the amendments. SFI's objective is set out in legislation and it is designed to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State, and that is a worthy endeavour.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">On that basis, amendment No. 16 will fall. I was hoping that the directions in this respect would not apply. In amendment No. 15 I was attempting to ask the Minister to include provision where, for example, the foundation could present him with 2 ft high of referred journal articles and point out, say, that what he had proposed was not worth pursuing. I know he can give a directive but this is about science. In the amendment I was providing for a situation where the foundation could supply him with the scientific evidence pointing out that, for example, his idea of XYZ that he would like to direct it to do would cost the country substantially. That is what I was seeking to do in the amendment, rather than for the approach to be that the Minister knows the position, he has the legal power and he tells the foundation what to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> I sought to include the wording whereby if the foundation genuinely believed it, it could "supply to the Minister refereed scholarly papers which recommend that the cost of the Minister's directions outweigh the benefits". SFI is part of the scientific society. Do we want SFI just to do what it is told or do we want it to be a bubbly source of ideas and that sometimes it might disagree with the Minister and say "With respect, what you have asked us to do will not be a viable project" or is its job just to salute and say "Yes Minister", to name but one TV programme? There should be a right of reply. The SFI is budgeted by the State but if it genuinely thinks something will get the country into trouble, and we have plenty of experience of that in other fields, should it not tell the Minister rather than simply say it was a ministerial direction, it complied and everybody shuts up, continues on and does what they are told? It is contrary to promoting the scientific community that the Minister of State and I both wish to see.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">A thorough reading of the research prioritisation steering group document will reveal a clear statement about research for knowledge and for policy. Science Foundation Ireland is not the only game in town. Science Foundation Ireland and the research prioritisation exercise is one of a number of research funders within the State. There are entities like the Health Research Board, the Higher Education Authority, Teagasc, the Irish Research Council and other such bodies. It is important that we have perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Research for knowledge is a key component of Government policy and that is embedded in the research prioritisation exercise steering group documentation. It is a fundamental principle and there is no moving away from that. There is also an adherence to the idea that if research does not measure up to excellence, has no impact or is found to be futile and going nowhere, there will be enough people within the system and externally, who will measure its impact and if it is deemed not to be fit for purpose the State can roll back its investment in specific areas. This is not written on tablets of stone. No research community in the world, where the state has an active part to play, is so inflexible that it will continue to research in areas where it is clear that there is no economic or societal impact or where the research does not measure up to the principle of excellence. </p>

          <p eId="para_400">As I have also mentioned the contents of amendment No. 17, I will not detain the Minister of State or the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> We all know picking winners is difficult, and we have 14. Picking winners is not the end of knowledge and prioritisation. Circumstances also change. Would it be a good idea to keep a fund for the disappointed people outside the 14? Could a percentage, perhaps 20%, of the funding be kept so that some projects could operate outside the system? As things evolve, we could observe how a person outside the 14 compares with some of those in the 14, and we might get some very pleasant surprises. </p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The 14 should not be static. Last year's list of prizewinners at Leopardstown might not be any use in two years time. We might want to retain this dynamic because research and knowledge is not readily corralled into any area. I accept that the 14 will be, broadly, good but we could never be arrogant enough to say they are exclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The Minister of State mentioned other avenues. The interest in this that people have expressed to me is a tribute to Science Foundation Ireland. I know there are other avenues, but this is the one many people think is really important. That is why they have been knocking on my door and suggesting amendments, which I am delighted to communicate to the House. Science Foundation Ireland is a very important body. If it gets this right, it will be hugely beneficial to the country, which is the goal we all share.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Does the Minister of State have any international evidence that keeping something aside for completely different, free range, blue sky research can yield interesting results? How about people who almost make themselves permanent and pensionable because something was a good idea ten years ago? As they will not be giving lectures, what will they be doing? What use is old hat research when we could have a much more vibrant community if we had more flexibility? If this amendment assists the Minister of State in the future management of the funds that is the spirit in which it is offered to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">I always accept the Senator's interventions in the spirit in which he makes them. We must be clear, however. Prioritisation is not the entire funding game. There is a myriad of sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> If the principle of excellence is adhered to and impact measured there should be no reason any researcher who is doing excellent research with impact within Irish society could not derive funding from some source. I wonder if some of the researchers who have approached Senator Barrett or are writing letters to <i>The Irish Times </i>or tweeting on this issue have read the steering group document. The document is giving birth to 14 action plans and the 13 systemic changes that are necessary. The document also contains a chapter giving examples of policy research. These examples include climate change, related environmental research, bio-energy, population health research and health services research. Those are mere examples. There is a funding mechanism for everybody, so long as the research measures up to the principles of excellence and impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The latest €60 million round of investment funding announced by Science Foundation Ireland two weeks ago includes many recipients of funding who are carrying out oriented basic research. There is clear evidence of that across a myriad of landscapes which map on to prioritisation, but more than €2 million was given to MACSI, a pure mathematics entity operating out of the University of Limerick. If we are imaginative, I do not see why we cannot continue to fund such researchers. They need to start thinking more laterally about engaging and collaborating in an interdisciplinary fashion, think about their own output as it stands at present and find new areas of opportunity for themselves. Some of them need to read the documentation before making false assumptions. I say this with respect, having read some of the public discourse on this issue. </p>

          <p eId="para_418">Section 17 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the District Court may grant an interim care order in respect of a child on foot of an application by the HSE. The order may be made with or without parental consent in accordance with the section. The application may arise in circumstances where a child is being cared for under an emergency care order, often following a decision by the Garda to remove a child to safety under section 12 of the 1991 Act. An interim care order may also arise as a result of an application by the HSE to take a child into its care in circumstances where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of that child. Before granting an interim care order, the judge must be satisfied that an application for a care order in respect of the child has been or is about to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> The HSE recently made a submission to my Department concerning the need to increase the duration of an extension to an interim care order to 29 days. The submission set out the practical rationale for seeking to increase the period of an extension to an interim care order. It also set out a strong case for urgent legislative change. In its submission, the HSE highlighted the difficulties it had been experiencing due to the necessity of having to return to the District Court every eight days for extensions to interim care orders, including increased stress for all parties arising from the frequency of court appearances, the difficulties for social work staff in forming working relationships with children and their families because of the frequency of adversarial court appearances, the amount of social workers' time taken up by court work, and increased legal costs for the HSE, families and guardians <i>ad litem</i>. In essence, the current application of section 17(2) of the 1991 Act is absorbing considerable court time and resulting in valuable social work time being expended in preparing for court cases and in attending court hearings.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The HSE's submission made a comprehensive and convincing case and I am, therefore, introducing the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 to make the amendments that are urgently required to the 1991 Act in that regard. In addition, the effect of the proposed amending legislation will be to facilitate, as far as possible, applications for orders or extensions to orders to be heard on the same day each week by the courts. This would assist the courts and the HSE in processing these applications and reduce the number of court appearances for all parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I will turn to the principal provisions of the Bill. Section 1 amends section 17(2) of the 1991 Act. Section 17(2)(<i>a</i>) of that Act allows for an interim care order for a period not exceeding 28 days in the absence of parental consent. Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the Bill will amend section 17(2)(<i>a</i>) by substituting "twenty-nine days" for "twenty-eight days".</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Act allows for an interim care order to exceed 28 days with parental consent. Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the Bill will amend that section by substituting "twenty-nine days" for twenty-eight days". Section 1(<i>b</i>) of the Bill will amend section 17(2) of the Act by substituting "where an extension is to exceed twenty-nine days" for "where an extension is to exceed eight days" in order to provide that an application to extend an interim care order can be granted for a period of up to 29 days without parental consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Section 2 of the Bill is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and collective citation.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I have introduced this amending Bill as a matter of priority. Its effect is that, on enactment, an interim care order or an extension to an interim care order, in the absence of parental consent, may be granted for a period not exceeding 29 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the Senators' opinions.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for attending. We fully support this short Bill. It is a technical requirement that will streamline the order process.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The Minister mentioned that she was introducing this legislation as a matter of urgency following matters being brought to her attention. Did she mean issues arising in the courts, the HSE or elsewhere? Sometimes, amendments to original Acts are important, and this Act dates from 1991 and may not be as workable as it used to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I wish to address the Minister's Department. What position is it taking on the implementation of the recent referendum? When a referendum passes, there is a great deal of follow-up legislation. Without going into too great a level of detail, what changes have occurred since the people voted on the children referendum and will further legislation need to be laid before the House in terms of the referendum decision's implementation? It was an important issue and I compliment the Minister on seeing it through. Her appointment as the first full Minister for children at Cabinet has had a great impact on young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Today is a good opportunity to ask these questions. Perhaps the Minister might respond to them at the end of her contribution. What developments have there been since the people voted, how has the referendum affected the work of the Department and will further legislation be introduced? I am delighted that, as a former Leader of the Opposition, the Minister has availed of the Seanad to introduce her legislation. She will always receive a good welcome in this House. I commend her on this Bill, which I accept fully. I wish the Minister well in her Ministry.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I warmly welcome the Minister to the House. I take the opportunity to commend her for her 18 to 19 months of work on the children referendum, which had been sought and requested for many years. It was vital, not just to get the issue over the line, but in terms of public discussion on the matter. It was great to see children's interests so focused in the minds of the media, politicians and others. The Seanad is lucky to have Members of the calibre of Senator van Turnhout who have dedicated their lives to working for children's rights. Organising that referendum in 18 months was a significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> As a student in UCD nearly 18 or 19 years ago, I discussed the importance of children with the Minister, who was then just Deputy Fitzgerald. It is good to see someone travel this distance. She has had her political battles and is doing a fantastic job.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The Bill could be described as technical legislation, but it is more than that. When enacted, it will impact on children's lives and the HSE's resources, which would be better spent looking after children's welfare instead of going to court every week. That an interim care order can only last for a maximum of eight days is unrealistic. HSE officials using up court time every week seeking extensions to such orders is not a good way to do business. As such, the Minister has made the right decision. The Bill ensures that the 1991 legislation is better enacted so that the welfare of children can become even more paramount. I have not even mentioned the effect on families and children of needing to attend court every week. We need to minimise people's court attendances, especially children's.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">It is not the type of environment that is conducive to a better quality of life for anyone, particularly children, and it can have, as I am sure others will comment on, a profound effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> This legislation tidies up something that probably should have been done a long time ago. Now that there is a full Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children and there is that ranking, children are given a far higher priority. There is a mandate from the people to ensure measures, which might seem simple or technical to the Members and to people outside these Houses following these proceedings, are taken but when one is in the throes of dealing with something like this it is a different situation. It can have profound emotional and psychological effects. Furthermore, resources are tight enough and there have been enough cutbacks. It would be beneficial if we could redeploy resources in a way that matters to people and that helps the lives of children, as opposed to having HSE officials go in and out of court every week. The arrangements, to which the Minister referred, whereby the court sitting will be on a specific day of the week is a factor in terms of the proper channelling of resources and that must be welcomed. </p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I have no doubt that as the Minister comes to terms with her Ministry and brings forward many more items of legislation such as this that it will have a cumulative effect to ensure that children are at the centre of this society in a real and meaningful way. I view this legislation as incremental progress in the right direction. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">The Minister is welcome, as always, to the House. Having regard to the children's rights referendum, as I have said here previously, I applaud, commend and congratulate the Minister on delivering on the Government's promise. When I was on the referendum trail, as many of us were, I listened to the concerns of many parents on the doorsteps, on the streets and at public meetings. We cannot ignore that some of the "No" voters spoke of concerns about how they have been treated or how they perceive they would have been treated in past, would be treated now or in the future and some of those concerns were based on reality and some were based on perception. In addressing these concerns, I stress the significance of the Department's decision to improve the social services system by removing child welfare and protection from the remit of the HSE and moving it into a dedicated new agency, the Child and Family Support Agency. I assure parents that the new agency will focus on early and accountable intervention that supports better outcomes for children and families and that will work to keep families together, which is something we all want to do where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> The Minister's Department published the report of the task force on the child and family support agency in July last year. I have asked the Leader of the House on a number of occasions if we could debate that. The Bill will be produced shortly and I ask the Minister to outline when it will be produced but I am also cognisant of the fact that the agency will have 4,000 staff and that it has a budget of €545 million. Many of us could make an impromptu speech about the failings of the system at present and we all want to get it right. We should have a debate on the remit, resources and vision for the new agency to help frame that Bill. I ask the Minister to give consideration to having a debate on it in the House perhaps prior to the publication of the Bill because this is an issue on which we could have a consensus in the House in that we that we all want to work together on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> I wholeheatedly support the Bill and welcome the initiative the Minister has taken in bringing it forward. The making of care orders under the Child Care Act 1991 is a very important function of the District Court in the interests of the child welfare and protection. Care orders are made where the District Court, upon the application of the Health Service Executive, is of the opinion that a child has been or is being assaulted, ill treated, neglected or sexually abused, or where a child's health, development or welfare have been or is being avoidably impaired or neglected or the child's health development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected. A care order allows the child to be placed or maintained in the care of the executive pending the making of a full care order. Ordinarily the first step in the process, as the Minister said, is an emergency care order, which can last up to eight days, followed by an interim care order, which, under the current arrangements, is only extended by a maximum of eight days in the absence of parental consent. We know that, in the interests of logic and practicality, District Court judges have recently - I believe it was the beginning of last year, under the recent direction of the President of the District Court- stopped granting 28-day extensions of interim care orders in cases where the necessary consent has not been provided. I welcome that the Government has put forward the amendments in order to give the clarity that is necessary because I believe this was always the intention. These amendments are urgently required to remedy the impractical and counter-productive nature of the maximum eight-day extension without consent in terms of finding and working towards an appropriate solution for children in the cases in question. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> The current system of returning to court every eight days to extend an interim care order - especially since extensions are practically always granted, I have talked to many solicitors working in the area about this - is not in the best interests of children and their families. The reality is that it creates insecurity for the child who knows he or she is being discussed in the court every week. One is over one court case and into the next one. It places an increased burden on parents that these cases are before the District Court every week and no time is given for consideration to work towards a solution. It means that social workers, team leaders and solicitors are in court waiting around all day to justify the continuation of the order only to return one week later again and again for the same case. This seriously undermines the time and resources available to social workers and team leaders who need to focus on the care and best interests of the child. It incurs an excessive and unnecessary cost for the HSE and the Courts Service. It creates unmanageable court lists and there are considerable blockages in the system. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I wholeheartedly support the Bill. The benefits of it are that it will move the focus to the best interests of the child because it will free up the time of social workers who are most important in this process and also other people involved in the HSE towards looking at the best interests of the child. There will be significant cost savings. It will mean that the courts will be able to deal with the cases that are necessary to be dealt with. It will also mean that there will be certainty and security for the child concerned and that he or she will know that this is what will happen. The emergency care orders are there for a reason but here we are talking about interim care orders. It will move the focus to working to find a solution that is in the best interests of the child and it will rebalance the focus from going to court to managing a positive outcome in the case. That is where the focus should be. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> I support the Minister bringing into line the 28-day extension to 29-days because it makes sense to have one day and one could say this is the day in question and it also ensures there is clarity and consistency which will greatly benefit the management of court lists. I thank the Minister for this. It is excellent that she has brought forward the Bill. Many people are waiting for it to come through and hopefully it will relieve a lot of time for those involved.</p>

          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_442">I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill and it provides for a sensible change. From my contact with people working in the area of social work, I know there is a clear advantage from is proposed in the Bill. It will provide more certainty for a child and he or she will be more likely to know what is happening. The idea of an eight-day period seems to be more of a stopgap and it could potentially be unsettling for the children involved. A practice had grown up whereby the extension was made for a period of 28 days and the President of the District Court rightly directed that correct procedures would be followed and that unless the necessary consent had been provided the court could not make an order for an extension of an interim care order in excess of eight days. It seems that what is proposed in the Bill is straightforward and sensible. It will assist the good administration of cases and it is in everybody interests that matters would be seen to happen in a consistent and coherent fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> I take the opportunity to express a concern, which everybody shares, about the extent of challenges facing us as a society in regard to child protection. I read of startling figures in the <i>Roscommon Herald </i>in recent days and if that is true for Roscommon it is true for other areas. The HSE in Roscommon alone dealt with 754 reports concerning welfare, physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect of children in 2010. It is interesting that the percentage of welfare reports that related to children was 67% in Roscommon, which is higher than the national average of 56%. While these may seem to be simply figures underlining them is a very distressing reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I take the opportunity to ask the Minister about the EU hotline for missing children.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I discussed the EU hotline with Senator van Turnhout yesterday. Significant progress has been made since December 2012. The hotline will allow the reporting of missing juveniles to relevant authorities, accept tips about missing children and their location, and provide emotional support to parents. It is available in 20 EU countries. The hotline is not yet available to the extent hoped for. It is currently available from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day, but it is hoped to have it available on a 24-hour basis from March 2013. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Can I ask the Minister about progress in that regard? Having debated this issue with her and others in this House, I know she shares the concerns expressed. I also pay tribute to people outside the Oireachtas who have informed us on this issue from time to time. I take the opportunity to ask the Minister about this. It is crucial that everything necessary be done to ensure the safety and welfare of children and that support needs to be on a constant basis, and more than 18 hours a day. It needs to be clearly visible to people that the hotline is there and fully operational.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and congratulate her on the Trojan work she is doing in the area of children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> As the Minister said in her opening statement, the Bill is of a technical nature and provides clarity for those in the legal system and, more importantly, for those working in the child care sector in situations where an interim care order has been granted and where consent has not been obtained from parents or guardians and will extend the period of orders from eight days to 29 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Interim care orders are granted where an urgent need for protection of a child arises, pending the determination of a care order application by the HSE in the District Court. It is important to stress that the interim care order is granted pending the determination of a care order in the District Court. Under section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Child Care Act 1991, where there was no parental consent to an application for an interim order that order could only be granted for a period not exceeding eight days. Where the consent of a parent or guardian was given, the period could exceed eight days. There was an amendment to the 1991 Act in the Children Act 2001 which changed the wording from eight days to 28 days. Therefore, where consent was not forthcoming or could not be obtained, the period of the interim order could not exceed 28 days. </p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The 1991 Act also allowed for an extension to an interim care order. It is on the extension that we are focusing today. The 2001 Act did not change the time period for the extension of an interim order under the 1991 Act, which remained at eight days. Therefore, although the practice arose of granting extensions for a further 28 days, consistent with the other provisions made by the 2001 Act, the President of the District Court rightly determined that unless there was the necessary consent the court could not extend the period of an interim care order for more than eight days. On the face of it, this made sense. Not only could the court not exceed its jurisdiction but in the absence of consent we would all accept that we must be careful to ensure that any committal of a child into care should be for no longer than is necessary. However, as has been carefully put to us by the Minister, the evidence from practice is that a change to bring about clarity and consistency was necessary. The change sought was to remedy a possible defect or omission in the 2001 Act by synchronising the two time periods. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The HSE has sought this change in the best interests of children and their families. Frequent applications, as the Minister has pointed out, to the court to extend an interim care order are not helpful to the child, the State or the services provided in the interest of the child. Moreover, these applications are taking up court time and valuable child protection resources in staff having to be available for court appearances. There is an understandable concern that this practice is wasteful for the HSE, the Courts Service and those acting for children, such as parents and guardians <i>ad litem</i>, and that the practice is unnecessary and wasteful.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The change sought is interesting. The application for an extension of an interim care order is not to 28 days but to 29 days. This is to allow for housekeeping, as the Minister has pointed out, and is eminently sensible in that it allows cases to be heard on the same day each week in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I am supportive of what is being done. There is, however, always public concern where the power of the State to remove a child without the consent of his or her parents or legal guardian is extended, and it must be shown to be necessary. With that in mind, I have two questions for the Minister. The first is on a point of clarification. In her opinion, was the retention of the original time period for the granting of extensions to an interim care order under the 2001 Act an omission by the Legislature or was it intended to retain the period of eight days? Does the Minister have a view as to why the Legislature did not extend the period to 28 days, as it did in the granting of interim orders where the consent of the parent or guardian was not given?</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Second, given that an interim care order is intended to protect a child until the HSE can proceed with a full application and that the interim order itself is for a duration of 28 days and intended to be temporary, why are successive extensions of interim care orders necessary and why are full applications not proceeded with by the HSE? </p>

        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Senator David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">I welcome the Minister back to the House to debate this important issue. I will be supporting the Bill because it is important that we continue to improve areas of child protection. Although the Bill is largely technical, it does tidy up some areas of child care policy, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The Bill which amends the Child Care Act 1991 seeks to allow for the extension of an interim care order, where consent has not been obtained from parents or guardians, from eight days to 29 days. This will bring the time periods in section 17(2) of the parent Act, the Child Care Act 1991, broadly into line, as all time periods will be 29 days, and 29 days will be a maximum for an interim care order without consent. With parental consent it can exceed 29 days. </p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The Bill seeks to improve the operation of the 1991 Act, an aim with which we are in accordance and support. Part 4 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, sets out provisions relating to the making of a care order and a supervision order. The responsibility for making such an order is with the HSE. While this is a significant responsibility it is clearly a necessary power if children are at risk. While it should exercise its responsibility with care and in a balanced way, there is no question but that it is necessary for it to carry out such a role. It is interesting that this was one of the issues that arose in the children referendum and was often used by opponents of the amendment in a very negative way.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Section 16 of the 1991 Act allows the HSE to make an application for a care order or supervision order in respect of a child residing in its area where it appears the child is in need of care or protection. A supervision order authorises the HSE to visit a child at specified periods to allow the HSE to ascertain the welfare of the child or to provide advice on the care of the child. Under section 17(1), where an application for a care order has been made or is about to be made and an urgent protection need arises, an interim care order can be made pending the determination of the care order application. Section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) provided that where the parent or person acting <i>in</i>
						<i>loco parentis</i> gave consent, an interim care order could be granted for a period exceeding eight days and where they did not give consent, for a period not exceeding eight days. This was amended by section 267 of the Children Act 2001, which allowed an interim order with consent for a period exceeding 28 days and limited an order without consent to a period not exceeding 28 days. Section 17(2) of the 1991 Act also allows for an extension of an interim care order. Until now, this would exceed eight days with the permission of the parents or persons acting <i>in loco parentis </i>and cannot exceed eight days without that consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The legislation will allow that to be extended to 29 days and it also amends section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) of the 1991 Act to allow for the application itself to be for 29 days maximum without consent and for longer where there is consent. This is necessary because it is believed that running to the courts every eight days to have the interim care order reviewed is excessive, not best practice and disruptive for the child in question. We agree this is not desirable. I understand from the Bills digest that following the amendment of section 17(2) by the 2001 Act, the practice arose whereby interim care orders without consent were granted for a period of 28 days initially with extensions of a further 28 days, which was mentioned by a previous Senator. However, due to the President of the District Court directing that a court cannot make such an order without consent concurrently, there is a need to legislate. If the Bill is enacted and all the time periods under section 17(2) become 29 days, the proposed amendment from 28 to 29 days will facilitate applications for interim care orders or for extensions to them to be heard on the same day each week by the court, which is sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I watched the discussion on the Magdalen laundries report on the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" television programmes last week and the issue of children of care came up. While there were serious problems in the past and mistakes were made by the HSE, the State must face up to its responsibilities and the Minister has sought to improve the care of children. In any attempt to do that, she will have my support and my party's full support because it is such an important area. It was one of the issues that was, unfortunately, used against all of us who were campaigning in favour of the children's right referendum. People said the State had failed children and asked why we were proposing the constitutional amendment. However, they missed the point of the referendum in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I fully support the Bill and will not table amendments to it.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieMoloney" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Senator Marie Moloney<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the Minister to the House. I will not regurgitate what previous speakers said because they have laid out clearly what the Bill entails. As Senator Conway said, we are lucky to have in our midst someone who has fought long and hard for children's rights as a Member, but we are also lucky to have someone at the helm in the Minister who has the same commitment and wants to protect the rights of children. With someone like her in office, we will not go wrong when it comes to the care of children. It was her commitment that got the children's rights referendum over the line, as people respect her authority when it comes to children's rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The Bill is a reflection of someone thinking on her feet and using common sense and joined-up thinking to reduce bureaucracy and administration by eliminating the need to run to court every eight days to renew interim care orders. This is important legislation for children and their families. It is my understanding that if the social services believe the welfare of the child is secure and he or she is not in danger, they can return him or her to the family within the 29 day period and, therefore, they are not obliged to keep the child in care for the duration if everything is in order. Will the Minister clarify this? I commend her for her work, which we all support.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_464">I welcome the Minister to the House. She is an ornament to her Department, as she was to this House when she was Leader of the Opposition. This is a simple, technical, one-page Bill. The first amending section provides for the substitution of 28 days with 29 days as the maximum duration for an interim care order. I read the Minister's speech but I was not completely clear about why this is necessary. That has been clarified in subsequent contributions, although I am sure the Minister clarified it. I apologise for not being present when she made her contribution but I had to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The principal Act, the Child Care Act 1991, is being amended by this legislation. I recall the debate on that Act well. I take a certain proprietary interest in some aspects of it because I was involved centrally in advocating for the guardian <i>ad litem</i> service. The second amending section provides for the extension of interim care order renewals from eight to 29 days, for which there are clear, technical reasons. There are also human reasons, by which I am rather impressed. It is being done because of the time wasted, the stress on all those involved and, in particular, the impact on the relationship between the child and the social worker. Those three points are well made.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I am concerned at a reference to the increased legal costs in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> scheme. I thought it was an excellent idea. I was briefed by Barnardos when the original Bill was introduced. I contacted its representatives about this Bill and they are pleased with it. They feel an extension is very necessary. However, I am concerned about the situation regarding the funding of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>scheme and perhaps the Minister could give the House some information about this. It has been suggested that the scheme is not adequately funded. I acknowledge we are in a greatly difficult financial situation but if we look back to the Roscommon incest case, there were suggestions that if the scheme had been adequately implemented, the suffering of those children might have been abrogated at a much earlier point. I was appalled at some fundamentalist Christians who intervened in the process and encouraged and incited the family to take the matter to court. That was profoundly shocking, given, subsequently, both parents were convicted of sexual offences against their own children. In general, the guardian <i>ad litem</i> scheme is a good one. It may have some flaws that may need to be ironed out. Given the Minister has raised the issue of costs, perhaps she could clarify the issue. If the House can encourage the Government and support the Minister to ensure the adequate funding of this mechanism, we will have done a good day's work.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_467">I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate. I welcome the response the Bill has received from them and thank them for their support. The legislation is in the interests of the children. A number of general points were made by Members regarding the protection of children. We have an appalling legacy but we are taking actions that will make a difference to children. The total number of children in care is 6,160. Senator Mullen referred to highlighting particular counties but it often brings it home a little more when one considers the number of children from particular areas. I have done that recently and this is something that needs to be shared more at local and regional level in order that people are aware of how many children are in care in their county and can examine the support mechanisms that could be developed at county level to make a difference to vulnerable children. We should do more of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> A question was raised about child protection generally and the development of the child and family support agency. I will be happy to come to the House for a debate prior to the legislation that will put the agency on a statutory footing. It will be available this term and a great deal of work is being done on it. The agency's management team has been put in place and the segregation from the HSE has been completed. Mr. Gordon Jeyes is the chief executive officer of the agency and new management structures are in place. There will be much less management, more accountability from the front line to the centre and greater access for front-line social workers to managers, which is important. The legislation is being worked on and we are also working on having a separate financial system in order that the agency can operate independently. It is probably one of the biggest pubic sector reform initiatives we are undertaking as a Government. There are 4,000 staff involved and a budget of €550 million. It is, therefore, a substantial reform Bill and it is a priority for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">This raised a number of other points. There is a suite of legislation that follows on from the referendum when all processes are completed. I published the adoption legislation before the referendum and that will need to be implemented in due course. </p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Legislation will also arise in relation to the best interests of the child and the views of the child. The child care legislation will have to be examined as a whole to see what other amendments are necessary. That point was raised by Senator Leyden. He also asked when the matter first came to attention - it was in the latter half of 2012. It was raised first, not by the HSE, but by practitioners and in the court who felt that what was happening was not in the interests of children. It was then raised with me by the HSE and I gathered the type of information which I have put before the House today. </p>
          <p eId="para_471"> A number of other points were raised which I would like to go through. I thank all the Senators for their commitment in this area. We are working collectively in terms of improving the services. I thank Senator Conway for his comments in respect of putting the best interests of the child centre stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Senator van Turnhout mentioned the pressures on everyone - parents, children and the courts - given the current situation. I agree with the Senator but primarily it is not in the interests of children to have this constant quick return to court before a proper assessment can be done, before proper care plans are made, before proper contact is made with the parents, where that is possible, and before proper discussions have taken place with the child. There is no question that it has become somewhat unmanageable and the Bill is intended to correct that.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Senator Hayden referred to the rationale when the original issue was raised. Senator Rónán Mullen supports the legislation and asked about the EU hotline. The ISPCC has taken over the hotline for which funding has been provided by my Department and we have also sourced EU funding. Senators played a role in ensuring this matter received high priority and it has been established. It started in December 2012 on a phased basis, 16 hours per day. I am pleased to announce the hotline will operate on a 24-hour basis by May 2013. </p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Senator Cullinane spoke about the Magdalen laundries report and what has emerged. We have to be conscious today that we do the best for those 6,000 children who are in care, particularly those young people who need aftercare. We spent €17 million last year on aftercare, which is a huge increase from previous years. Some of these young people who leave care need huge supports. I want to focus particularly on the group of young people who have been in residential care and who move on, some of whom have very complex needs. Yesterday I met Focus Ireland and many of organisations which work with the homeless to discuss how we can best co-ordinate services for that group. The Senator's point is well made that we need to be sensitive in the here and now to the challenges and the supports we need to give to more vulnerable children, so that the situation that emerged, due to a lack of supports and aftercare from which those women and young girls in the Magdalen laundries suffered, will not re-emerge. We have to examine current issues and children who are vulnerable today and ensure we do the right thing by them. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I thank Senator Marie Moloney for the points she raised. Senator Hayden asked about the rationale when the legislation was introduced. An immediate issue she has raised for consideration was the policy intent at the time of amending the Child Care Act 1991. I am informed that based on an exhaustive review of all available files and discussions with relevant officials, where available, it can be concluded that there was no policy consideration given to the extension of interim care orders at that time. All available documentation relates solely to the extension of initial care orders. In this regard it is assumed there was no policy imperative at the time of the amendment either for or against increasing the period of extension to 28 days, in the absence of consent. That is the background information as to how the issue was approached at the time. </p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I am not aware that it has been suggested that it was a mistake but equally the files do not show that a positive policy decision was made but the eight days would not be changed. That is as much background information as I have on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Senator Norris raised the issue of costs and guardian <i>ad litem </i>among other points. The guardian <i>ad litem</i> system has been developed hugely. At this point it needs to be reviewed. We need to put a national structure in place because the costs at this time are very high. It is a really good system and I recognise the Senator's role in ensuring we have a guardian <i>ad litem</i> system. It has been <i>ad hoc</i> and is very expensive. A proper system must be put in place outlining clear standards and criteria and qualifications of those who do the job. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and I intend to address that issue. </p>

          <p eId="para_479">I thank the Senator. Last year the legal costs of the child and family support agency were €31 million, a very large amount of money. We need to examine these costs. It is a huge part of the budget. In that regard I welcome the move by the Minister for Justice and Equality to establish family courts. I believe the system is far too adversarial and is not in the interests of children. We need to move towards mediation and family supports rather than the current adversarial system which I do not believe serves children very well. Certainly we must examine the guardian <i>ad litem</i> which is in need of development and reform into a proper structure.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I welcome the Minister to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> As we all will be aware, the national lottery has been a remarkable success. In 2011, €761 million was spent on lottery tickets and €232 million on good causes. However, this afternoon I feel that I am like the guy with one bullet who is being approached by 100 Apache and 100 Arapaho coming across a mountain in front of me because I have a distinct belief about the sale of the lottery licence. I am constantly fighting on the corridors and hearing, "You are not on about that again," from senior members in both parties in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I have great respect for the Minister. He is a most worthy opponent. I have respect for his office and his ability, but I do not respect his decision to sell the national lottery licence. I want every Senator and Deputy, or the ones who are here, to hear my arguments and make up their minds on the facts, not on their tribes. I also intend to ask the public in the next few weeks to follow my arguments about the appalling sale on a blog, <i>dontlootthelottery.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> First, let me get rid of some untruths about the sale of the lottery licence. I call them untruths with great respect, but they are untruths. The Minister must open up the lottery licence to competitive tendering for renewal. The Minister told us he does not have discretion regarding whether to hold a competition for the next lottery licence, and he is correct. The present lottery licence, held by An Post National Lottery Company, is due to expire next year and it is up for renewal. This is true. Nothing could be truer. The Minister is obliged to renew the licence. The time is up. The time has come. The Minister must act under EU law and directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> What is different this time? What is my problem? The difference is that the Minister is being a little disingenuous with this information. What is different is that the Minister has decided to sell the licence while he is at it. Nobody asked him to sell it. Nobody told him to sell it. His Department decided to sell it all on its own. Renewal does not mean sale. Renewal is not sale; sale is sale. Would Deputies and Senators stop arguing it as it is completely untrue? I will interrupt anyone who refers to a sale as though he or she was talking about renewal during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Minister is hiding the sale behind renewal and confusing the issues. It is very clever. The Minister is using the renewal process to push through a sale of the lottery licence to the highest bidder for €500 million up-front to build the national children's hospital. If the Minister was not selling and looking for this €500 million up-front, An Post would be reinstated because its running of the national lottery has been unmatched. However, the Minister is selling. An Post does not have €500 million - neither do I and neither does anybody else in Ireland - and the Minister must sell elsewhere. Let us get ready because the swagmen, the loot men and booty men are on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> "So what?", they argue, stating that the Minister has assured them all that good causes funded by the lottery will be ring-fenced, held unmoved, rigid forever, despite the new sale. Every Deputy in the country has asked whether the good causes, the retailers and the 108 administrative jobs will be protected. All will be protected, they are told, but this is not the question. The question is why are we selling the lottery licence for €500 million for 20 years. I do not know anybody who gives one €500 million and walks away. What do the swagmen get for €500 million?</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I believe they are swagmen because they are private sector firms and consortia, gaming and gambling organisations, global players such as Tatts Group, GTECH corporation which is a subsidiary of Lottomatica, and Camelot which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. These only make big money bids for assets if they think they can make bigger money down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> If I rang up the Minister and said that I am Camelot, Tatts or GTECH, I have €500 million and I am interested in investing in the lottery licence because I am cash rich because of pension funds elsewhere, I could make a bid, but my big question is what is in it for me. The Minister would tell me there is a significant payback. "What is it?", I would ask, since the lottery, as run by An Post, seems very tied up - 54% on prizes, 31.5% on good causes and 14% on administration, agents and commission - and there is very little left over. The payback is that I would open interactive sales and gambling online. The Minister may impose certain legal restrictions, boundaries and taxes, but he and I know that it is the greatest cash cow. Even with restrictions, there is a significant profit over 20 years. My response would be, "That sounds like a good deal, I will be back to you." Why else would the swagmen give us €500 million? What they will get is the opening up of online gambling. I need not tell anybody here the danger of that. They need only take a look at the "Prime Time" report by Mr. Joe O'Shea two weeks ago on this very topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> At present in Ireland gambling online is available to a very limited extent and the National Lottery Act 1986 restricts online players to Republic of Ireland residents. However, we, through legislative changes, will open this up. We will pay €500 million for it and the swagmen, who have already met the Minister, will get the money. No amount of emotional pleading on my part will possibly stop that.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I met nobody. It is important that the Senator understand that.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieLouiseODonnell" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_508">It is the selling, not the renewal, that is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I am surprised many Deputies and Senators have not seen this.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> I could try to get the money to build the children's hospital through a dedicated draw, perhaps on a Wednesday night, over five or six years. If we had done this for road construction we probably would not have paid a €10 billion overcharge for work not done. The Minister speaks about an updated model with €500 million from the highest bidder but what is updated about this? The Minister speaks about New South Wales where this was done but we are not comparable to New South Wales. We are more comparable to Auckland. The Minister stated it would be remiss of Ireland not to take a similar approach to New South Wales but these are bad comparisons. It is not good governance to copy. Alleviating physical pressure by using the lottery and the opening of online gambling, which is primarily played by the poor, disadvantaged and less well-off is, once again, the greatest transfer of wealth from the working man to the private money swagmen. Gaming consortia are coming to bail out the Government and take away the huge profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> The facts remain that if somebody gives one €500 million and one gives the person a licence for 20 years and online gambling is opened up to pay the interest on the loan, it does not make it right. The only reason the Minister is repealing the National Lottery Act 1986 and changing the legislation is to do just this and open up online gambling. There is no other reason to do it. The Minister needs to stop telling us it is about something else.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> It will be a mess and it is wrong because it was an idea of its time, when the cost of finance and yield on Government bonds was between 8% and 10% but now it is at 3%. The time for it has passed. If it is sold for less than €500 million it will be disastrous for the people's money. I wish to inform the Senators of an important fact - it is not included in the target to raise €3 billion through the sale of State assets set by the EU and the IMF. The troika sales target includes only hard assets such as the ESB and Bord Gáis.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Minister states he is concerned with all stakeholders. I am a stakeholder. I cannot hold back online gambling and I would be a fool to try, but if it is going to be done let us do it ourselves and ask the Irish people about a dedicated draw to build the children's hospital. They will build it for the Minister without hesitation. The Minister does not have to sell our lottery licence. It is the people's money from the charity of their pockets. I do not believe it is the Minister's to sell. It does not belong to him to sell.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Senator Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_514">Senator O'Donnell asked Fianna Fáil to second the motion and I am delighted to do so. She will start a national debate on this which is very welcome because people are not fully up to speed with what is happening. Her motion is moderate and in tune with the public. Fianna Fáil has opposed the establishment of a regulator but this is neither here nor there with regard to the motion. We are more than happy to second it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The motion calls on the Minister to ensure ownership of the licence remains entirely in the State and people would expect this of their national lottery. It is generally the case with lotteries throughout the world, particularly in the United States, that they stay in their own areas and are seen as a badge of nationality. They are national organisations. Spain and Italy have lotteries. Lotteries came together to form a European lottery. In the United States, each state has its own lottery. It is seen as a geographical or national item and this is an important point to remember.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> A huge issue arises with regard to the children's hospital towards which there is a huge amount of goodwill. I have no doubt of the huge political goodwill in government and opposition towards it. The legislation the Minister proposed in the other House does not contain a mechanism to ring-fence the money; therefore, by calling for a dedicated weekly draw for the children's hospital, Senator O'Donnell raises an important issue and highlights a major flaw in the Government's proposal. From a legal point of view there is no commitment to give any money from the sale of the lottery licence towards a children's hospital and this will be a point of huge concern for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The national lottery was established by a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government in the 1980s, and one of its flaws is that money was never ring-fenced for good causes. Money from the national lottery went straight into the national accounts and this has been true under all Governments involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party over many years. I am led to believe this flaw was pointed out in the 1980s. I complained when I failed to see money going to good-----</p>

          <p eId="para_523">I can say I often raised the question as to why money was never ring-fenced. The money one pays for a national lottery ticket goes from the newsagent through An Post straight to the Exchequer. One then hopes a Minister will spend it on the good causes on which one expects it to be spent, but this is not the practical reality. I am very concerned about the lack of a legal commitment or a dedicated draw, such as that proposed by Senator O'Donnell for the children's hospital in her motion, because we do not have a track record as a nation of dedicating the moneys supposedly reserved for good causes to those good causes. The money goes to the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is occasionally delivered out. This system, which has continued for almost 30 years through various Governments, is wrong. I tried to change it and I made this point on a regular basis because I was frustrated no money was distributed in certain years for national lottery good causes, or so it seemed.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> A dedicated draw, as proposed by Senator O'Donnell for the children's hospital, or a legal obligation on the Government to use money from lottery proceeds towards the children's hospital will be essential. Otherwise people will not have faith in the system if they believe this is simply a political commitment and not a legal one. People need to be able to grab onto something and know for definite where their money is going. This is not in the proposed legislation. The people do not trust political commitments from any party on these matters. We need a law or a measure such as that proposed by Senator O'Donnell.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> There will be a good debate about the National Lottery and I hope Senator O'Donnell's campaign takes off. Sometimes debates in these Houses do not get reported very widely. Legislation may be guillotined or passed in the midst of much other legislation, and gets ignored by the wider public. This debate will be useful to get the public involved in the debate in order that they know what is proposed for their lottery and can respond and changes can be made if this is what they desire. I compliment the Senatoe on the motion which we will certainly support.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Senator Deirdre Clune<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_526">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_527">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann", and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_528">"welcomes the decision of the Government to hold a competition for the next licence to operate the National Lottery, in accordance with EU legal requirements;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_529">notes the publication of the National Lottery Bill in December 2012 which, once passed by Dáil Éireann, will come before the Seanad;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_530">recognises the major achievements to date of the National Lottery and the widespread support of the Irish public for the Lottery;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_531">recognises the need for the State in the current economic situation to pursue opportunities to generate additional revenues that do not impact on taxpayers;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_532">welcomes the fact that the next licence will involve the ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes each year; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_533">welcomes the fact that the new licence will also involve an upfront payment to the State which will enable the construction of the new National Paediatric Hospital to progress without further delay.".</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Bill has passed Second Stage in the Dáil and to the best of my knowledge Fianna Fáil did not oppose the principles of the Bill but had questions on regulation and the level of and commitment to the upfront payment to the children's hospital. It certainly did not oppose the Bill or the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> We all agree the national lottery has served us well since 1987. However, the licence is due for renewal - I use this word because that is what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The Minister is required under EU competition law to advertise and seek expressions of interest. The measure to seek an upfront payment is welcome. I am sure that the Minister, when he has the opportunity, will state when a new paediatric hospital will be built.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I note Senator O'Donnell's and the other Independent Senators' proposal to establish a dedicated weekly lottery or draw. I would question that proposal because it could take a long time to establish. Do we have the necessary resources? We need the money now for the children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> The licence is due to be granted and not necessarily to the highest bidder as certain conditions are attached to it. That may not attract the number of investors hoped for. When the licence was offered for renewal in 1999, An Post ended up the only body to win the licence because two interested parties withdrew. An Post will have the option to bid for the current licence and I wish it success. The preferred bidder will be welcome. The national lottery contributes to good causes and the money has been very beneficial to communities. We can all quote the advantages of it and the good causes that have received necessary funding which would not have existed only for the lottery. To data the national lottery has had the support of the people. It has operated well. There has never been any question about the operation of the fund by An Post, the draw and its system of collecting moneys. We can all say that it has done very well, but now it is being opened up for renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I noticed the figure of €500 million was mentioned but I could not find it. I do not think the figure is correct. I do not think that the Minister or the Government has ever recommended or stated an expected figure. The licence is open to the market and we will see what we get. I congratulate the Minister and the Government for their innovative proposal in terms of providing funding for a children's hospital. The proposal means that money will be collected upfront. The licence will not be given away. It is an opportunity for somebody to operate the licence for 20 years. That licence will still be held by the State. Perhaps a consortium, individual or an organisation such as An Post will operate it on behalf of the people whom I hope will continue to support it. Contributions have decreased in recent years which reflects the economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> In 1987, when the national lottery was established, it was at a time of economic difficulties. It was an opportunity to provide funding for good causes and necessary developments across the country. The scheme has worked well and I hope that it will continue to do so. I wish the Minister well with the development and his proposals.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_541">I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate Senator O'Donnell on her courage and innovation in tabling the motion. It is timely. I opposed the lottery Bill. I opposed the selling of our assets. I recognise that there has been a consistent dumbing down of this society. Just the other weekend I watched television and for one hour, every single station that was accessible in my home, carried a gaming show of one kind or another. That is the type of society in which we live. I deplore it but it is the reality. If the State can do good with this measure then so be it as far as I am concerned. I am very concerned that we are selling off the asset. I read a speech by Deputy Kenny in the other House and he made a distinction between selling the lottery and selling the licence. In my opinion that was a specious, Jesuitical argument. Selling the licence is effectively selling the lottery. If it is not then it is renting the lottery. One could adapt James Joyce and say that they there were people around the place who would not only sell their country for three halfpence but they would get down on their knees and thank the Almighty Christ they had a country to sell. We can just substitute "sell" with the word "rent". There are people who would be delighted to say that they had rented the country. In fact if one continues the metaphor of renting, we are renting out the goose and buying back the eggs. That is a considerable mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> With regard to Senator O'Donnell's proposal, she first articulated what I have always thought was a prime article of faith for a socialist, to control and keep nationally the productive elements in terms of the financial strength of the country. I thought that was a <i>sine qua non</i>, that we wanted to keep our wealth and use it in the interests of the people. I support that aim completely. It is stated in her motion: "ensure that the ownership of the National Lottery Licence remains entirely within the State ... conduct a competitive process" but ensuring that the profits are "wholly and entirely" used for the welfare and "benefit of the Irish people." Who can argue with that? I certainly cannot and I doubt if the Minister will be able to. Then there is provision to "build the Children’s Hospital". That aim has been built into Senator O'Donnell's motion. Let us not have any of this business whenever we speak about this matter, and to which I have referred previously, of "Don't hit me with the baby in my arms." The baby is still in the arms of Senator O'Donnell and she will fight to protect it. I do not accept that the children's hospital will in any way be affected by accepting her motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> I would like to ask Senator Clune a question. She is a very decent Member of the House. What did she mean by or the Minister can spell out what is meant by "ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes"? What is a significant level? I would like to know.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Within the past week I watched "Nationwide" and a very moving part of the programme dealt with a facility for people in Kildare affected by spina bifida. There was a woman whose life had been absolutely revived by being involved in a sports recreational hall that had been provided by lottery funds. A young man was interviewed and he said that it had been a positive thing for him to end up in a wheelchair because he never would have competed at international level in sports. I thought that was an astonishing comment. At least the lottery gives hope, optimism and some degree of future to these people, yet we are talking of giving it away to the international gambling combines.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Let us look at them. One of them was Camelot which was said in an article recently to be eyeing up the licence. Of course it is. Why is it eyeing it up? It is eyeing it up because it can make more profit than we can or at least it thinks so. I want the profit to stay here. I do not see why, since this is a republic, we want to give it away to the English or, as they have now been identified, a teachers' pension fund in Ontario. What is the point of doing that? That is what we did with Eircom. We gave Eircom away and it became a pension fund in Australia. A well named Australian company is interested in the lottery and is called Tatts. If not Tatts, how about the Italian gaming giant Lottomatica which hid under the sobriquet of GTECH? I feel it would be a very funny exercise if we were to hand away our national gambling institution to the Italians because their reputation in that area has not been entirely without odour.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> The Minister has indicated - he will correct me if I am wrong as I would not want to do him an injustice - that there will be €200 million set aside for the national children's hospital. That is the kind of figure that is being talked of. Various estimations of the value of the lottery sale have been tossed around and range between €400 million and €600 million. An independent assessor who knows the market has said that it is about €100 million. We may get €100 million but we spend over €230 million every year so the sums do not add up, just like Coillte. The sale of Coillte was a brainwave until Professor Peter Bacon pointed out that it was financial madness that would expose us to €1.3 billion of downside consequences. Why are we doing this? It worries me very much. It seems to me to be all of a piece of this kind of daft thing. We are selling for €100 million, which is what we will probably get, something that brings in €230 million every year for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The areas in which the lottery funding is disbursed is on sport and recreating, health and welfare, arts and culture, Irish language, all activities with which we agree. I should state a vested interest in the lottery, I am one of a small number of people who still have my little plastic wallet and have been doing the lotto religiously since it started and I would like the Minister to know that I am very grateful - I won the lotto on last Wednesday and got €5 and two scratch tickets and one of the scratch tickets produced another scratch ticket that had two of everything and produced nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">The people have a vested interest in the lotto, 62% to 63% of people regularly engage in the lotto that is the reason I believe it should remain in Ireland. We are fifth <i>per capita</i> in terms of lottery sales in Europe. We are only eight in terms of the distribution to good causes. Instead of trying to sell off the lottery, perhaps we could increase the percentage that goes to good causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I read the Bill and a Minister can become the regulator. With due deference to those present, I was not impressed by the distribution of funds recently decided by Ministers, which appeared to be far too blatantly partisan and for electoral purposes. I think that was wrong and I deplore it. I said it when it happened during the Fianna Fáil Government and I say it again with Fine Gael in government. It is not Government's money, it is never Fine Gael's or the Labour Party's turn to do this, that or the other, it is always the welfare of the people that is at stake and it is always the people's money. We should be accountable in this House for that money and I salute Senator O'Donnell for holding the Government to account on this very important matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">This issue was previously debated in the Seanad in May last year when I had the opportunity to discuss the matter and to hear the views of Senators, and have had heard the views of many individual Senators since. As member are aware, the National Lottery Bill was published before Christmas and has passed Second Stage. The Committee Stage of the Bill is currently before the Dáil. I look forward to debating the detail of the Bill with Senators when it comes before the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> The National Lottery Bill 2012 is intended to replace the National Lottery Act 1986. Under the Act, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may issue a licence to a person or company to hold the national lottery on behalf of the Minister on behalf of the State. I am very conscious that I accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to my own electorate. The new legislation will also provide for the operation of the national lottery under a licence on behalf of the Minister. Since its establishment, the national lottery has been operated under a number of consecutive licences by An Post National Lottery Company.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I would like once again to pay tribute to the very substantial achievements of the national lottery since its inception in the mid 1980s. During the past quarter of a century, the National Lottery Company has come to be regarded as a very innovative and successful national lottery. Since 1987, it has raised about €4 billion for good causes right across the country, an astonishing sum.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The decision to establish a national lottery was taken at a time of economic difficulty for Ireland in the 1980s. We are again seeking to address very serious financial and economic challenges. Notwithstanding the successes of Government in renegotiating the repayment schedule for the promissory note last week, we still face very significant economic challenges. There are very real demands on us as a society, not least from the hospital sector. In view of these challenges, the Government decided in November 2011 to explore the opportunities presented by the expiry of the current lottery licence. Following an examination of the various options by my Department, the Government, elected by the people, agreed in April 2012 that the following arrangements will apply to the next national lottery licence:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_557">- There will be a competitive process for the award of the licence which will be for a period of 20 years;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_558">- The terms of the next licence will include an upfront payment to the State - the intention is that part of this upfront payment will be used to help fund the building of the new National Children's Hospital - I will go into some detail on how that is to be ringfenced if Senators wish;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_559">- The next licence will involve the ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes . I have indicated a quantum analogous to what has been generated to date. There will be no diminution of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">As I have mentioned, the National Lottery Bill was published in December 2012.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">It has varied year on year. The most recent figures I have looked at were for 2011 and at that stage it was 30.05% in that year. The Bill has a number of purposes, in particular: to continue to provide a legislative framework for the operation of a national lottery; to continue to safeguard the integrity of the national lottery, for example through the continued safeguarding of cash generated by lottery sales; and to provide for a new national lottery regulator, a new innovation to deal with the point which Senators raised, the issue of unregulated gambling. We will have a lotto regulator - I have had discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter - which in time will become the gambling regulator, in order that we will have control in so far as we can over gambling. So many online gambling operations are based in Singapore, Hong Kong or other place as that is the nature of new technology. Most of those who contributed in the Lower House welcomed that innovation. The office of the regulator shall be funded by the national lottery operator and will be independent of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Let me set out certain principles reg</p>
          <p eId="para_564">+arding the regulation of the national lottery, for example, the circumstances in which a licence may be amended or revoked. If the body who is awarded the licence does not meet the conditions and the standards we expect, we can revoke the licence. The standards will limit the quantum of money we will get for it because we want to have a very tight ship. I note that the original motion, before the amendment was tabled welcomed the appointment of a national lottery regulator. The National Lottery Bill 2012 passed Second Stage in the Dáil last week and the Committee Stage debate is awaited.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The competition for the next licence will be undertaken by my Department. I have approved and published on my Department's website a protocol which sets out the procedures to be followed regarding contact with potential bidders.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">That is the reason I interrupted Senator O'Donnell. I have met no potential bidders.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I have instructed all senior officials in my Department on the clear channel, in order that all issues relating to the awarding of this contract will be handled with absolute probity. There should be no doubt whatsoever about it. It is envisaged that the competition will commence during the second quarter of 2013. My Department is being assisted in the financial and commercial aspects of the process by Davy Corporate Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Let me repeat, I do not have any discretion regarding whether to hold a competition for the next national lottery licence. This is a point which I would like to emphasise strongly. A number of commentators appear to be under the impression that I as Minister have the option to award the next licence to whomsoever I wish. This is simply not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The motion tabled before the House "calls on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ... ensure that the ownership of the National Lottery Licence remains entirely within the State". Under European Union law, it is open to any European to bid for it and, consequently, it is not only unlawful but would be unethical for me to fix the result, which, were I to confine it, is what would be implied. All those colourful people about whom the Senator spoke, good people from either the United Kingdom or Italy, are entitled to bid, as we are entitled under the Single Market to bid for licence arrangements. This is encompassed under the Single Market provisions and the Government must be open to deal with it in that context. To be blunt, when going through a process to comply with European competition law, it is quite astonishing for a House of Parliament to suggest one should fix the result.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">Bidders from other jurisdictions, as well as Ireland, may well bid for the licence. I do not know yet but I hope they do. Therefore, it follows that the licence cannot deliberately be kept under Irish ownership. I have explained this point repeatedly. The State may set the terms for both the competition and the licence itself - these terms concern the duration of the licence and the final arrangements underpinning it - but the Government has no legal authority to determine that only an Irish bidder will succeed. Were I to make such provision, I would open the State to being sued instantly and the entire licence would be nullified by the European Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> This will not be the first time that a competition has been held for this licence. Some Senators will recall that a competition for the current licence was held between 1999 and 2001, which attracted interest from three interested parties, not all of which were from the State. Following the withdrawal of the other two parties during the course of the competition, the licence was awarded finally to the incumbent, namely, An Post National Lottery Company. This might well be the case again. I do not know. It might be a successful bidder, either by itself or in tandem with others. As I have stated, I am not involved in dialogue with any individual or potential bidder.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> The Government is using the opportunity presented by the competition for a new licence to generate an up-front payment. This was an innovation when I was trying to put together a stimulus package, and I refer to another point made that somehow this is not part of the EU-IMF targets. It deliberately is not, as I kept it separate because under the original EU-IMF target negotiated by the previous Government, all the proceeds of the sale of State assets had to be used to retire debt. Through repeated negotiation over a year and a half, the troika has agreed the Government may use half of those proceeds to invest in job creation in the State, with the balance being used as a backstop to generate even more money, but ultimately to retire debt. This concerns half of the money the Government will generate from the sale of State assets. However, I have always kept this sale separate because I wish to use it in its entirety for good purposes, the predominant part of which will be to build the new children's hospital. I have not included that aim in the Bill because there is no necessity to so do. One does not include such a provision into a 20-year structure for the Bill. However, I can give Members my word - which I hope is good enough - that this is my intention and that of the Government in respect of this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Moreover, that word will be tested very quickly because, as Members will be aware on foot of the announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Health, the Government is now advancing this development and a project team has been appointed. I have no other money available for this purpose. The Government will build the children's hospital in the shortest possible time and the dedicated money for the project will come from this source.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I do not need to remind Senators of the difficult economic circumstances in the country. Given the present budgetary position, the Government must be innovative and creative when opportunities arise to generate money like this. It must establish how, in a country that is starved of capital, it can get at money to do things that are really important right now. It must so do both to generate the hundreds of jobs that will flow from this project and to have a flagship national children's hospital that it is hoped will serve both the State and the entire island of Ireland. It is to be hoped that even in the face of adversity and economic difficulty, it will be something of which this generation will be proud. Failure to think creatively about how the Government might find additional resources has a cost. That cost will be reflected in an inability to provide vital elements of social infrastructure for the people. Therefore, as I indicated, the Government has decided to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the timing of the lapse of the current licence to dedicate it in a different way to fund the children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Recent years have seen a number of states and regions, to which reference has been made, make new arrangements for their lotteries. A number of jurisdictions are examining how best their state or regional lotteries can help to alleviate financial pressures. It would be remiss of Ireland not to take a similar approach. The Government is committed to doing the best deal for the State that can be done and, as I have noted, there are three key elements, namely, an up-front payment, the maintenance of confidence in the ongoing revenue stream for good causes, in which regard I can give Senator Norris my assurances, and continued public support for the role, ethos and integrity of the lottery. All these elements must be reflected in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The original motion tabled this evening called for a reconsideration of the decision to allow for the sale of national lottery tickets via interactive channels. I am aware that a number of Senators rightfully have concerns with regard to this issue. Since its launch in 1987, the national lottery has been dynamic and it is essential that it continues to evolve in line with changed consumer patterns. Consumers now expect to be able to conduct their business online and the online element of the national lottery must be developed further. Incidentally, it is already in existence, as the lottery already has an online element. I note that when buying an airline ticket nowadays, I no longer go to my local travel agent but go online as a matter of course, and unless one wishes to impose a time limit whereby the national lottery will simply filter out over a timeline to the future, one must move towards the platforms people are using. However, this must be done in a regulated fashion, which is the reason I have devised and successfully recommended to the Government the establishment of a regulator to ensure it is done in a prudent way, and this should migrate to other channels. If this is not done, people still will gamble online but the benefits to the State in respect of good causes will be lost and a much less regulated environment will prevail than that being proposed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The national lottery has a very strong record in respect of player protection. It will be ensured that these standards will continue to apply throughout the period of the next licence. This will be provided for under the terms of the licence itself and the new national lottery regulator also will have a key role with regard to player protection. Globally, lotteries are doing more business on the Internet. In the context of a 20-year licence, provision has been included in the new Bill providing for the sale of lottery tickets via interactive channels, as it would be a Luddite view not to prepare for the next 20 years. However, I stress that such games, which as I have mentioned already are available online on a pilot basis, will be rolled out in a way that will protect minors and vulnerable adults. In addition, experience in other jurisdictions, such as, for example, the United Kingdom, indicates the sale of lottery tickets on the Internet will be in addition to, rather than instead of, sales in shops and other retail outlets. It is imperative that the lottery is fully aware of the risk of problem gambling, and its approach to the suite of products it produces should reflect this. I will ensure both the licence under which the next licenceholder will operate and the office of the regulator, which will be established under this provision to enforce the licence, will have as a priority an exemplary approach to these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I am particularly heartened to note that the lottery industry globally takes this matter very seriously and a number of proactive procedures are in place to address this problem and are being enhanced by reference to latest research.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">A national lottery is in place to benefit the community and not in any way to harm it. I wish to see people continue to play the lottery, and as Senator Norris does, be successful occasionally. I wish him even greater success in the future. A large proportion of the population playing a little is the preferred model and one on which I intend to base the licence. It will be a condition of the licence to comply with strict codes and procedures regarding the area of problem gambling. I will seek to include in the licence particular requirements for the online environment. It is worth noting that online play does allow for a greater level of monitoring and a capacity to intervene to prevent problem patterns of play developing. I have examined international best practice to ensure that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Central to the success of the lottery over the past quarter of a century has been the provision of lottery funding for good causes. During the debate on the Bill in the Dáil, speakers placed great emphasis on the importance of the many projects, in all counties, from community health to sport, the arts and heritage, which have been helped by national lottery funding. It is intended that the next licence will continue to provide for the ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I note that a number of Senators have concerns about the provision for an up-front payment. I am pleased that we are agreed on the need to raise funds for the building of the new children's hospital. The motion tabled by the Independent group referred to substituting an upfront payment with a hypothecated lottery. I understand that would involve a dedicated weekly draw, which was explained to me by the Senator, to raise funds for the hospital. I have no doubt such a dedicated draw could well be popular and the motivation for such a proposal is well intentioned. However, it is highly likely that such a draw would simply see players switching their usual spend on lottery products to one that would be dedicated to assist funding the hospital and, by definition, the other good causes would suffer. I want the hospital now. I want the money to build it now. I do not know how I could organise it by saying we would get a drip-feed of money on a weekly basis in the next 20 years. The cost of borrowing on that basis would be enormous. I need the money now. The country needs the hospital now. The way we have designed it is innovative to get an up-front payment from the next licence holder and to be able to dedicate that to such a fine and important cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The decision to provide for an up-front payment under the next licence was made after careful consideration. Unlike the alternative proposal which has been put forward, the Government's approach will ensure the raising of funds to allow us to proceed with the building of the hospital. The hospital will be built and will not compromise the flow of funds into the future for good causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The national lottery has been an outstanding success story for this country. I note the genuine concerns expressed by a number of Senators. I respect them and the manner in which they have voiced their concerns. However, I stress that the Government is committed to safeguarding the national lottery to make it fit-for-purpose into the future. No institution is caught in a time warp. We must allow for change unless we want the lottery to die. The Government is also committed to availing of the opportunities to ensure that the much needed national children's hospital is built.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The Senator's motion does not take full account of the particular circumstances in which the Government has to make a decision regarding the next lottery licence. I hope I have set that straight. Such decisions involve choices. I am confident that the upcoming competition for the lottery licence is being framed to deliver the best result for the State. Reference was made to €500 million in the Senator's opening comments. She regarded anyone who would pay €500 million as a swagman.</p>

If we did not have the regulator, the licence regime, the protection of minors and the protection surrounding online gambling, there is no doubt we would get more money. The Government has made a balanced and innovative choice. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">With respect, I listened to the Minister. First, on the figure of €500 million and the clear statement that there was no basis to it, while waiting to speak I put "national lottery, Brendan Howlin and €500 million" into Google. The Minister must speak to his spokespeople. Numerous newspaper articles come up in response to the search. If we take <i>The Irish Times</i> in August 2012, there is a reference to the lottery licence sale Bill being due next month and to the Minister saying the building of the national children's hospital could be part-funded by a front-load payment secured for the next licence to operate the national lottery. It was stated that the upfront payment to the State could be in the region of €500 million while some €200 million could go to the children's hospital project. The article indicated that the Minister's officials have met and held conference calls with potential bidders for the licence. I went to many sites. I was alarmed that <i>top-10-online-gambling-sites.com</i> is very excited and proposes to bid for the national lottery. That makes me hesitant about what is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> The Minister has said we cannot afford it. It is a difficult subject because it is about the national children's hospital. I passionately agree that we must build the hospital. I have been waiting for it. The announcement by the Minister for Health was to set up a new board for it. The hospital is like the carrot at the end of a stick. We are constantly being told that it will go ahead. I concur with Senator Norris's image of holding the baby. It has become an emotive issue. I want the hospital to go ahead but I do not understand why we cannot have a hypothecated draw. "Hypothecated" is a new word for me.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">I had to look it up. I wonder why a cost-benefit analysis has not been done. Have we looked to our nearest neighbour in the UK which had a draw for the Olympic Games? From what I read there was not a huge decrease in the other draw. People got behind the London Olympics project and supported it. Whatever one thinks about the Olympic Games, one could certainly motivate people behind the national children's hospital, which for me is part of the reason the motion has been tabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The Minister also referred to interactive sales channels and mentioned that such games are already available online. It made me think of my mum saying that just because someone says one should jump over a cliff does not mean that one should do so. I am concerned about the growth of interactive sales channels, as we all are. I am trying to think it through logically. If I was a reputable company that wanted to buy the licence, I would expect a return on it. If I were giving an up-front payment, I would expect a return. Such a return would mean that the money raised would not go to good causes. One does not get a free lunch. As a reputable company why would I give an up-front payment? It would be because I expect to get something. Several companies around the world are now taking steps to regulate interactive sales channels. Perhaps I would expect this country to be a little more lenient on such channels. I do not say that is the Minister's intent but where is the carrot for a company to make an upfront payment? No company would have the same vested interest in us having a national children's hospital as the people of this country. The people of Ireland want such a hospital. I am open to being convinced by the Minister's arguments but I am not. My gut is asking why we are not renewing the licence or staging our payments?</p>

          <p eId="para_610">I welcome the Minister to the House. I am grateful for him coming to the House to take this motion in person because it is an important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I wholeheartedly support the spirit of the motion and know Senator O'Donnell is genuine in her concerns and those concerns are not to be dismissed or taken lightly. I would like to be able to vote in favour of the motion but as the expression says, it is more than my job is worth, I would be expelled from the parliamentary party due to an archaic whip system which is an absurdity on a motion. The Seanad should be allowed a free vote on such matters, if only to express our concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The expression "If it is not broken, why fix it?" comes to mind. The national lottery was well constructed and has worked well over decades. As the Minister pointed out, it has yielded a significant €4 billion for worthy and charitable causes. I am concerned we have hitched the lottery wagon to the national children's hospital, for which the entire country is crying out. We commend the Government for the progress it is making, for finally choosing a site and proceeding with the matter after years of prevarication and delay. Are we saying that if we do not get the correct bid and a bidder who pays the money up-front, we will not get the children's hospital? Did we really put all our eggs in the one basket? That is a danger attendant in this approach. While it is creative, it is risky because the Minister cannot foresee the outcome of the tendering process. If we do not get a bidder who is willing to put that kind of money up-front, does that mean we will not have the funds to build the children's hospital?</p>

          <p eId="para_614">My understanding is that we should build the hospital anyway. The funding is already embedded within the national lottery process in that it generate funds on an annual basis. The Minister asked Senator van Turnhout where she would get the money but normally these projects are not paid for up front, they are paid for over a 20 year period.</p>

          <p eId="para_619"> I have no ideological objection to this because we should make sensible decisions rather than getting hung up on who runs what and who owns what but we have precedent in this area, where a previous Government, with the best intentions I am sure, privatised Eircom on behalf of the State and it turned out to be a get rich quick scheme where everyone was supposed to walk away with a windfall and Eircom would become a great new company in private hands and we all know what happened next. It was a fiasco, for which we are still paying the price.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">Therefore, we should re-examine the essential privatisation of the national lottery. The same pitfalls are embedded in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I also fear there is an element of not wasting a good crisis. Some people have an interest in selling off State assets like the lottery and Coillte. It is short-sighted and should be revisited. If we look at where we turned to the private sector in terms of roads and tolls, we paid them enough up-front to do the job and then promised them more money even when motorists pay a high fee to use the toll bridges. Now we are subsidising them on top of that because of a flawed strategy where we top up payments to the private companies that run the toll roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> This Government has done Trojan work and I commend the Minister and his colleague the Minister for Finance for making considerable towards regaining our economic independence and coming out from underneath the strictures of the troika. We are within touching distance of going back to the markets and having our own independence. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that this is not the time to sell of the family silver. It is a time to take a long-term view. I agree the national lottery yielded billions for the arts and community projects and sports organisations, but I would question where some of that funding went. I doubt it was ever intended for it to go to exclusive golf clubs. There is not a person in the State who would begrudge the money from the national lottery being set aside for the national children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I welcome the Minister's comments about the insidious invasiveness of online gambling. It is now in our living rooms; it is impossible to watch any sport now without gambling being available. People do not have to leave the comfort of their homes to spend the family's income for the week. That is a danger and it is important the Minister appoints a regulator to put a back stop in place for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We need clarity on this. If we are going to proceed as the Government is minded to, we must be clear about what is happening and ensure there are safeguards in place in the legislation to make sure we do not create bigger problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_628"> It strikes me that there is nothing the Government will not privatise, there is nothing it will not sell off.

          <p eId="para_630">Time will tell. Trees are to be privatised. Now the national lottery is to be privatised. It comes as no surprise to me but it comes as a surprise to many of those who voted for the Labour Party and perhaps that is one of the reasons the party is now so low in the polls.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I strongly support the core principle of the motion is that the national lottery licence must remain fully within the ownership of the State and that the benefits of the lottery must be used for the material benefit of the people. That must be the core principle of the national lottery.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The National Lottery Bill is going through the Dáil and my party colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, has had exchanges with the Minister in the House and has expressed our concerns about that Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">My problem is that the Minister has not provided a clear rationale for the proposed changes to the regulatory framework, licensing process and national lottery expenditure. Currently, one third of the income generated from national lottery's sales is allocated to good causes and community organisations rely heavily on this funding stream. As part of the new licensing arrangement, the Government is proposing to award a 20 year licence worth €1.2 billion without including a legislative clause to preserve the proportion of income used to fund good causes at the current level of 30%. </p>

          <p eId="para_639">When introducing the 1986 legislation, the Minister of the day spoke of the need for public trust and confidence in the operation of a State lottery. In that respect, we have been served well by An Post. The Minister referred to EU competition law. In extending the term of the current contract by 18 months, did he breach EU competition law and, if not, why can the contract not be extended for a longer period?</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> One of the hooks on which the Minister is trying to sell this deal, if it can be described in such terms, is that we can front-load capital funding for the national children's hospital. The best way to fund hospital building projects, including the new national children's hospital, is to ensure we have sufficient tax revenue to pay for them. For this reason, Sinn Féin has put forward proposals to increase taxation. Our proposals include the introduction of third rate of tax of 48% on income in excess of €100,000 per annum, which is similar to a proposal made by the Labour Party when it was in opposition. This is but one of many examples of ways to fund capital projects and most certainly not the means by which some health capital projects have been funded in recent times. Documents leaked recently by RTE showed what was taking place in the south east in respect of the funding of capital projects. I do not see how any of what is proposed can be reconciled with the Government's new politics or described as a new departure from the way things were done in the past. </p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I am concerned about the reason the Government has adopted this approach. It appears to be a case of generating as much cash as possible without considering the long-term consequences of its actions. This is not good governance or something we should support. When Labour Party Senators indicate they have genuine concerns about the legislation - I am not trying to score political points - it is incumbent on the Minister to listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I support the Independent Senators and welcome their decision to raise this important issue and afford us an opportunity to discuss it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineNoone" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Senator Catherine Noone<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_643">I also thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and Independent Senators for raising this issue, as it is a good idea to debate it. The Bill is a practical and sensible solution for two reasons. First, it ensures an upfront boost for the taxpayer and will generate additional moneys throughout the duration of the licence and, second, it creates a framework which allows the State to receive the best possible bid and, as such, derive the greatest possible benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> As has been noted, the terms of the licence are not included in the Bill, although the legislation provides that the licence should be published and publicly available with the exception of commercially sensitive information. It is expected that the licence will be extended in duration from the current ten year period to a 20 year period, an up-front payment will be made to the State by a new operator and the current management fee will be replaced by an operator's fee which will generate greater profits for the successful company. These measures are welcome as a 20 year bidding period adds stability. It is also important given the likelihood that numerous bidders will seek the contract. </p>
          <p eId="para_645"> As the Minister noted, the rationale for the new approach is to help generate funds to build a new national children's hospital. While I accept that this is an emotive argument, assets are acquired and built up over time in order that they can be liquidated when money is needed. While it is a pity that we must sell the national lottery, it makes sense to do so in the current climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> As official figures have not been provided on the revenue the sale will generate, I tried to get to the bottom of the issue. It appears the licence will generate between €400 million and €600 million for the State. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us in that regard. Notwithstanding the final figure, the proposal to sell the lottery license remains a sensible one.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The legislation allows for the possibility that the national lottery will be managed by a private operator, permits online sales of lottery products and sets out the key principles for the regulation of the national lottery. For reasons outlined by the Minister, it does not preclude An Post or the State from bidding to operate the national lottery, providing only that a private operator may compete in the bidding process and thus ensuring an optimal outcome for the State. After the bidding process has been completed, the current operator may be awarded the licence to operate the national lottery.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> I share concerns expressed by previous speakers about online sales of lottery tickets and I am heartened to learn that the issue is being examined. Gambling is a frightening issue and one on which we require a general strategy. While the national lottery is a form of gambling, other aspects of gambling are of much greater concern. I commend the Minister fjor his work and while I cannot support the motion, I thank Independent Senators for tabling it.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">My colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, has outlined the Fianna Fáil Party position on this issue. I am interested in the figures involved in the sale of the national lottery licence and the Government's view that the lottery has been a wonderful and extremely successful facility. As the Minister will be aware given that his party was in government at the time, the national lottery Act was a welcome innovation which was embraced by the electorate in what were straitened and difficult economic times. People asked why we had not introduced a lottery much sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> If I am correct, under the original terms of the Act, all of the money generated from sales, with the exception of administrative and management fees, was to be spent on what are euphemistically described as "good causes". As far as I can recall, the legislation spelt out what proportion of revenue was to be allocated under various headings such as sport and recreation, national culture and heritage, the health of the community and youth welfare and amenities. I believe this is the reason members of the public embraced the national lottery. I am of the opinion, although there is no evidence to suggest this is the case, that a secondary consideration for a significant number of those who buy lottery tickets every week is that the money will go to good causes. While they may not necessarily purchase a ticket for altruistic reasons as they also hope to win, at the same time it is nice to know that money is being allocated to good causes, even if, in reality, only 30% if revenue is allocated for this purpose. </p>
          <p eId="para_651"> The national lottery is essentially a slush fund for the Exchequer and has been used as such by successive Governments to finance various Departments. The money allocated under the 30% rule is allocated by the various Departments within which the various categories of heading fall. Considering that provisional figures, either from this year or last year, indicate that €761 million was collected from the national lottery, why was it not suggested in discussions surrounding this Bill that the Government revert to the original terms of the National Lottery Act, under which all the money would go to good causes? </p>

          <p eId="para_668">It works both ways. The Minister also cannot give an assurance. He is putting it out that he is against this particular concept, which is an innovative one, based on no evidence, yet Senator O'Donnell has put forward evidence that when it was used for the Olympics in the UK, it worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> Several references were made to online and interactive gambling. I understand the online gaming industry is to be regulated and that it will be taxed. That is another possible source of income. A very significant amount of money is generated from online betting and other forms of gambling. Perhaps the Government would consider increasing the proposed 15% tax, which appears to be the European norm, to 20% for a period, which money could be used towards financing construction of the new children's hospital. I am disappointed the Minister believes this would not work. </p>

Perhaps it is an idea that might be considered in the context of the overall funding of the national children's hospital. I await with interest the bids expected that are going to generate the €400 million required. Everybody across the House shares the Government's view that the children's hospital should be built as quickly as possible and that the resources required to do so should be provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">I welcome the Minister to the House. I recall the day the national lottery was launched. I purchased a £2 ticket that day for one of my children, who won £2 in that draw. I thought it was a good idea, although it was opposed at the time by the Fianna Fáil Party. I am sure Sinn Féin would also have opposed it. As I said on another occasion, were we to give Sinn Féin the winning lottery numbers for Saturday, they would oppose that too. Fianna Fáil rowed back on its opposition to it when in government as it saw the value of it in terms of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> As in the 1980s, we are in economically tough times. The establishment of the national lottery in 1986, when times were tough, was a great move on the part of then coalition Government. It has been so successful, with €4 billion of funding from it benefiting every town and village throughout the country. There is hardly a football, tennis or GAA club or community that has not benefited from funding from it. </p>
          <p eId="para_677"> The children's hospital is an important matter. However, I do not believe people buy national lottery tickets because they think their local club might benefit from funding from it, rather they buy them, as I do, because they hope to win €50 or €500. They buy a scratch card hoping they might get three stars and get to spin the wheel and win a larger amount. We all wish for that. I am sure everybody here has played the lotto. Playing the lotto is not gambling. I have never heard of a person who is addicted to playing the national lottery. Gamblers are usually addicted to playing the slot machines and so on. The national lottery is a good way of collecting money to the benefit of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> It is important the purchase of the national licence is put out to tender. As stated by the Minister, it will be awarded to the highest bidder, who will then generate money for the company. As the licence will return to the ownership of Government in 20 years time, we still have a grasp on it. The national lottery has been successful. I am sure the children's hospital will benefit from it in the future. I am sure future generations will see this as a good move. I appreciate the concerns of Senator O'Donnell and others in terms of our losing control of the national lottery. The record will show that it has been progressive in terms of providing funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I thank Senator O'Donnell and her colleagues for tabling this motion, which is well intentioned. I did, however, have a sense of<i> déjá vu</i> when I saw it in terms of us having had a similar debate on a similar motion in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The principal difference as I see it is that we would have a dedicated draw, the funding from which would be used on a drip, drip basis to fund the children's hospital. I propose to make the same points which I made in that previous debate to which I referred earlier. The Minister has addressed the concerns raised. From a personal perspective, I believe the Minister's response has been robust in terms of his defence of what is proposed. It is somewhat ironic to hear Senator Mooney talking about the intentions of the Government and the ways in which construction of the children's hospital could be funded given Fianna Fáil when in government had 14 years to do so to no avail. There were no special stamps for sale during Fianna Fáil's reign.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">A number of good points have been made during this debate, which have been addressed by the Minister. The time to sell an asset - the lottery is not being privatised, rather it is being licensed - is when one needs money. The time to sell is now. We have waited for far too long for a new national children's hospital. If I had any belief in Senator O'Donnell's proposal, I would be the first to support it. However, I do not. I do not believe we can wait one minute longer for a children's hospital in this country. The time to sell this asset is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> The lottery is not a port, strategic infrastructural asset or a bog. I do not believe its sale will impact in any way on the capacity of the economy to do its business. The Minister in previous speeches has given many assurances in regard to national lottery employees and the retailers likely to be impacted by sale of the licence. We will probably have another robust debate on this matter when the Bill comes before the House. My view on this matter has not been changed. As far as I am concerned, the Minister has given a guarantee that there will be an up-front amount of funding set aside for the construction of the national children's hospital, which is 14 years too late.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I welcome the Minister to the House. It is probably not best to speak last because everything that has been said were words I was going to utter. This is like <i>déja vu</i> because on 26 May last, we had a debate on a similar motion. I am somewhat confused because I cannot understand how the motion is reappearing, particularly at a time when the National Lottery Bill 2012 is being debated in the Dáil. In a few weeks, when the Dáil has finished debating all Stages, it will be sent to the Seanad for the Second, Committee, Report and Final Stages. It will have been debated in this House at least six times. In view of the fact that the national lottery is the subject of new legislation being debated in both Houses, perhaps it would be wise of Senator O'Donnell to wait until the Bill reaches the Seanad and speak to the legislation at that stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">I hope all Members have bought their lottery tickets because in one hour we will go into a draw. I remember when the then Minister, Donal Creed, introduced the national lottery in the 1980s. At the time, the funds were to go to sports and the arts. I am delighted to say that sport has definitely benefited throughout the years. In the London Olympic Games we saw the great success of Irish Olympians, with more Olympic medals than at any other time since 1956. Those athletes have benefited from the contribution from the national lottery.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> A dedicated draw to benefit the national children's hospital simply will not work. As someone who has been involved with Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin since 1985, I know a dedicated draw would be objected to by every other charity in the country. A dedicated draw would be objected to by the citizens of this country because they would ask why they should spend their lottery money on it when taxpayers should be paying for it. I disagree with a dedicated draw.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The national lottery is not being sold. It is up for renewal and, under EU law, the State is obliged to hold a competition for the next licence. The national lottery will continue to be owned by the State through the Minister. Inasmuch as the lottery is held on behalf of the Minister, the goodwill and rights pertaining to the national lottery are vested in the Minister. After the licence expires, the national lottery will be run by the regulator or, where no regulator is appointed, by the Minister until a new licence is awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> What the Government is doing has been done successfully in other EU countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Sweden. Even in the United States, it has gone out to tender and been successful. We must think outside the box at this most difficult time. The Government is being creative, innovative and is creating an opportunity to generate additional financial resources to provide vital elements of social infrastructure for our population. Ireland is experiencing a difficult financial and economic challenge and because of this, the Government decided the licence must go to tender. In fact, it is not that the Government decided it because it is EU law. I am not sure what to believe of reports coming from the media of between €400 million and €600 million upfront payments to the State. There is a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> referring to €100 million but I am not sure what numbers to believe. I have faith in the Minister and what the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> This is not a blindfolded quick pick or a lucky scratch card. This is a guaranteed lottery win for the State, on behalf of the citizens, to cash in on what we have built up for the past 26 years. It is not like our hard assets. If Senator Norris found out they were selling the Joyce Tower or the Cliffs of Moher to a commercial bidder, there would be uproar. This is completely different. The money generated from the upfront payment will certainly give the Government the impetus to at least get the foundations of the new national children's hospital built. In the lifetime of this Government, when the lottery is sold and if the up-front payment achieves anything between €100 million and €600 million, at least it will be a down payment on the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The Bill repeals the 1986 Act and, in doing so, develops the legislation for the national lottery. However, it does not alter it significantly. The Bill will provide greater transparency about the licence and will provide an enhanced system of compliance and enforcement. The main changes implemented by the Bill are to provide for an independent regulator, which will be chosen by the Minister, to oversee the operation of the licence and competition for any new licence. This is done on behalf of the Minister. The regulator has investigative powers and a progressive series of enforcement procedures that can ultimately lead to a High Court action and the revocation of the licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Under section 9, the functions of the regulator are as follows: to license the holding of the national lottery-----</p>

The Minister has indicated he will safeguard the allocation of revenue to good causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> The new model for the operation of the national lottery ensures it will be properly run and overseen by the regulator. It presents a real opportunity for the State to generate much-needed funds to benefit the community and the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">When talking about change, we all get nervous. As an agent in Clare selling national lottery products on a daily basis, I have an attachment to the State national lottery and the An Post National Lottery Company. Change is always challenging for everyone. I have thought long and hard about this and have read the legislation and the supporting documentation. As late as today, I looked at what was produced by the Oireachtas library and research service. It is probably change for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> In recent times I felt the national lottery needed to be changed. I am deeply uncomfortable with the lottery providing an online service, <u><i>www.lotto.ie</i></u>, where people can gamble online. One of the criteria of the licence as it applies to agents, usually small shops throughout the country, is that there are rules and regulations prohibiting the sale of lottery products to people under 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">If someone has a clear problem with gambling, the agent is obliged to try to ensure that the person does not spend all of his or her resources on gambling. Unfortunately, there is not this type of restraint in a bookie's. It certainly does not apply online. It will be a challenge for the Minister to address this online issue with a new company, but he has absolute integrity and a long history in politics spanning a number of Governments. He will make his decision based on the best advice and international experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I am concerned about the future of the retailer. The national lottery has been the backbone for many families. However, I am reassured by the fact that the commission paid to retailers will be ring-fenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> Like every Senator, I would like an Irish company to run the national lottery, but we are a member of the European Union. Is there a way around this issue? If so, the Minister will identify it. During the next 25 years, the national lottery in whatever guise or corporate governance structure will provide much-needed resources for many hundreds of worthwhile projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> I have listened to this interesting debate and look forward to discussing the legislation when it is laid before us. I wish the Minister well in his endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> I have also been asked to second the amendment, which I do now.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">To address Senators Eamonn Coghlan and Hayden, just because a person says something once, does not mean that he or she cannot say it twice or thrice. I am entitled to table the same Private Member's motion as many times as I like. The patronising of me has been extraordinary. It is as if I needed to be talked to. The patronising is obfuscation.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The Minister is a worthy opponent. When I stated "opponent" previously, I meant it in the most gracious sense, in that my opinion and belief in this matter differ from his. I take him at his word, but selling the lottery licence is wrong and I am opposed to it. Senators must stop hiding the sale behind renewal. They are different issues, but they are being married together as if one is necessary because the other is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I accept the Minister's statement that he has not met any bidders, but his Department has been speaking with someone. He has no discretion in whether to hold a competition for the next lottery licence. As he stated, if the Government does not hold one, its members will go to jail. However, it was a Government decision to sell. I suggested a figure of €500 million because it was quoted in our most learned newspapers. I read numerous articles. We could sell the licence for an up-front payment of €500 million, to the highest bidder or for an amount of between €300 million and €500 million. Even though I am against the sale, I would like to believe that, if it was done and the Apaches got me in the end, it would be sold for the highest price. We are discussing the pennies of the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Whether the Government ring-fences the 30.5% for good causes is not the issue. Rather, the sale is the issue. If the Government is going to open up online gambling, why can we not attempt it? Why must it be meted out to someone else, be it Lottomatica or GTECH? Why can we not get the profits? Why must we always copy elsewhere? Why is New South Wales the guru for what we should be doing? I have stated all of this earlier. Why would someone give the State €200 million, €300 million or €600 million unless he or she was going to get something in return? I do not care whether a company gets that something next week or the week after, but it will get a major return over 20 years. That money should come to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> An Post cannot bid. From where will it get €500 million or €400 million? It will not be able to bid. It may be a partner, but only a small partner in such a bid. We should get the money upfront. Regardless of whether we restrict, tax or legislate for the upfront money, the consortia bidding - the GTECHs and big gaming boys - will take in a great deal of money. Consider the ESRI report. That money belongs to the disadvantaged, the less well-off, the poor, the dreamers and the me. It is our money, which has been held brilliantly. An Post is unmatched in how it has run the system. Let An Post do it. Let An Post open up online gambling. Let An Post be our new Lottomatica.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> There is an hypothecated lottery in England. It is big word that means a parallel draw, which is done one day per week and was used for the Olympic Games. I would like to see the evidence of how it undermined good causes. The claim that good causes would be undermined if the Irish lottery's Wednesday draw was opened up to include the national children's hospital is disingenuous, given the fact that Ireland is the most generous country in the world. The time has come and gone, given the figure for Government bonds is at 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> To address Senator Noone, how does an up-front payment ensure a boost to the taxpayer? She mentioned that gambling was frightening and it was a pity that we needed to sell. Gambling is not frightening for the gaming boys who will buy the licence. We cannot ask the poor to bail out gambling casinos. I will try not to allow it to happen. Good causes will be cordoned off, but I do not want the profits on my lottery ticket going to a pension fund somewhere in Ontario.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I raise the issue of Bandon Community Hospital and acknowledge the tremendous work done by our former Seanad colleague Peter Callanan over many years in trying to resolve the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Bandon Community Hospital is a single storey building dating back to 1929. It is run by the HSE and has undergone some renovations and modifications over the years. The facility and staff provide respite and palliative care for 22 elderly people of mixed dependency. The hospital serves the people of Bandon town and the wider community, covering a 12 to 15 mile radius ranging from as far as Clonakilty to Kinsale and therefore serves a community of approximately 33,000 people. A private nursing home in the area closed at the end of January last year which was a huge loss to the area. The hospital has a number of bedroom units and has only four single bed units. </p>
            <p eId="para_724"> For the past 25 years the issue of Bandon Community Hospital being extended to cater for an ever increasing and dependent population has been discussed and a sequence of events has followed. In 2004 the final draft of the proposal sent by the hospital was eventually agreed by the Southern Health Board and in 2005 and 2006 it was deemed a priority. In December 2006 a design for the extension was prepared and in May 2006, almost seven years ago, the allocation of the funds for the extension were granted to the HSE. In 2007-08 the design was finalised and planning permission was applied for to build the extension in June 2008. In December 2008, following a six months delay to facilitate an archaelogical dig as a condition of planning, Cork County Council granted planning permission for an extension to the hospital. In the same year the HSE was instructed that no new projects were to commence due, unfortunately, to a reduced allocation. In 2009-12 HIQA inspections continually cited to the HSE that the facility is not adequate for the service it provides. Given that HIQA inspections will not be getting any more lenient, I advise the Minister of State - I am glad has come to the House to reply this matter - that my concern is that this important community hospital for the town of Bandon will close. In other words, there is a very strong case for the upgrading and extending of this hospital. I note from figures for the area and having regard to the population served by the hospital and HIQA standards, which provide that there should be 6.4 beds for every 1,000 persons over the age of 65, that this would mean that the hospital in Bandon would need to cater for 50 people. The current facility with the capacity to cater for 22 people is not appropriate. </p>
            <p eId="para_725"> I was delighted that the senior Minister, Deputy James Reilly, visited west Cork last Friday. He visited Bantry hospital and Schull, where I currently live, and he saw the tremendous work that was taking place there, much of which I was involved in over the years. I am aware that these things move slowly but if the proposed extension to Bandon Community Hospital is not addressed in the short term, I am deeply concerned that it may close. The closure of a significant private nursing home in this area recently presents a serious problem in terms of the provision of services. A serious problem is emerging due to the shortage of nursing home beds in the area in which I live and probably in many other areas of the country. I am referring to the private sector where there has been a decline in provision as we moved from the boom to the bust era.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. As the Senator is aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme. In 2012, with a budget of almost €1 billion, financial support was provided for more than 22,000 people in nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Bandon Community Hospital in Cork. Bandon Community Hospital, as the Senator well knows, was built in the 1930s and has been extended and refurbished over the intervening years. There are 22 beds at the hospital providing continuing, respite and palliative care. There is a very high level of demand for the hospital's services and other similar services in the area are in short supply. With an ageing population, as the Senator has pointed out, it is envisaged that the demand for beds at the hospital will continue to grow. During the past five years approximately €300,000 capital funding has been spent on refurbishments at the hospital. An additional €74,000 was spent on fire safety measures and the hospital received a fire safety certificate of compliance in 2012. The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is pleased to say that the hospital has been confirmed as meeting relevant HIQA standards for three years with effect from 28 June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> Current constraints on public sector staffing and recruitment, the ongoing need to meet service and safety standards, and severe financial constraints all pose challenges for community nursing units across the country. The Department of Health is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan which will seek to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources that are available. The future of Bandon Community Hospital will be considered in this context. All options will be considered to deliver an optimal outcome for those who need these services, and this will include service consolidation, skill mix considerations, and a review of work practices. All developments must be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must, unfortunately, be planned against the realities of these constraints. Every effort will be made to ensure the highest standards of care will continue to be provided for all residents in a safe and secure environment and that we meet the needs of those who need services in the very best way possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House and giving me this response. He has been frank and, unfortunately, the future of hospital is somewhat on a wing and a prayer, while accepting that HIQA has given it a three-year lease of life, so to speak. Due to the growing elderly population in the area and the ongoing deferment, due to lack of finance or otherwise, of the purported extension which has been planned for many years, I am deeply concerned that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the future of this important hospital for Bandon town and its hinterland. I do not expect the Minister of State to say anything further but I want to put on the record that I am deeply concerned that this hospital may be forced to close and, if it does, it will be a huge loss to the community of Bandon and its hinterland.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. He is taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills. He will be aware of the cuts announced in the last budget in regard to teaching posts for colleges of further education. For the information of the Minister of State and to do justice to the people who sent me correspondence, I want to read into the record details of it. The first is a letter I received from Helen Finlay, the VTOS co-ordinator for the college of further education. She said that the college is facing a significant loss of teachers which will result in the removal of courses developed and provided in response to the needs of the community. She also said that the reduction of between 100 and 200 places on courses will mean the decimation of a service relied on by thousands of people in the south east, a region which already suffers from chronic unemployment and the loss of major employers in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> I also received correspondence from the acting principal of the college, which states that the cuts to further education, as per 2012 December budget, will affect the 4.6 teacher allocation cut to the college, with the resulting loss of up to 120 college places to the region. Does that not make a mockery of what the Government is trying to do in terms of its jobs action plan and what the Ministers for Social Protection and Education and Skills are trying to do, in a co-ordinated way, to ensure we have proper labour activation measures, upskilling and retraining and the provision of opportunities for people to get back into the marketplace and workforce and receive the education they may need to be able to take advantage of the kinds of jobs the Government says it wants to create in terms of its jobs action plan? It is interesting that the areas and courses that will be affected most if these cuts go ahead are in the areas of tourism, business, child care, IT and beauty therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">If we take any one of those on its own, we can say the State has made significant tourism investment in Waterford in recent times. The Minister of State will be aware of the huge investment in the Viking Quarter in Waterford city. All that was welcomed. When courses are being provided to people to allow them to take these opportunities and for us to exploit the potential of the investment being made, it does not makes sense to cut back on these courses. </p>
            <p eId="para_733"> Why were these cuts announced and what is the logic behind them? How do they make sense in a region where unemployment is 25% above the national average? At a meeting with Oireachtas Members last week, the Waterford city manager confirmed that unemployment in Waterford city is over 20%. It is scary to think that is the unemployment figure in a city the size of Waterford. Why, then, are cuts like this being made to a college of further education that provides a service, not only to the people of Waterford but to the entire south east? </p>
            <p eId="para_734"> I am genuinely interested in the logic and rationale behind that decision and how the Minister of State and the Government feel it sits with the overall jobs action plan and the attempts the Minister of State says the Government is making to provide labour activation measures and opportunities for people to get back into the workforce.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon<recordedTime time="2013-02-13T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_735">I begin by acknowledging the hard work and dedication of the staff of Waterford VEC and of VECs across the country in delivering further education courses, including PLC courses, to learners. While this measure affects PLC provision, a range of further education and training courses are available across the sector. While it would have been preferable to avoid any changes, by bringing the PLC pupil-teacher ratio, which is the cut referred to by the Senator, into line with that in free second level schools, my Department has succeeded in protecting the class sizes in primary and free second level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focused on the children in the education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> As the Senator is aware, PLC courses are designed for school leavers and adults returning to education to enable people to gain specific vocational skills which enhance their prospects of employment, as well as providing a route to progress to higher education. There are 32,688 approved PLC places available nationally and this will be maintained into the next academic year. By maintaining the number of approved places, my Department has sought to mitigate the impact of the change.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> The majority of PLC courses are provided by VECs, with the remainder delivered in community and comprehensive and voluntary secondary schools. My Department allocates PLC places to VECs and other schools and approves courses for delivery annually. The VECs then allocate places to schools and colleges within their remit. The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will reduce the number of PLC teaching posts by 200 and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for learners.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> In 2012, my Department provided €160 million in funding for PLC courses. This covers staff costs and non-pay costs, as well as student support. This investment enabled a total of 36,500 people to participate in PLC courses. PLC courses are free for unemployed people and those on low incomes and two thirds of PLC participants are availing of this. There is a €200 participant contribution for other participants. This measure is expected to generate some €12 million in estimated savings in a full year and €4 million in 2013. To amend this measure would mean introducing additional budget measures in education which would impact on other front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> City of Waterford VEC has approval for 790 PLC places for its two PLC centres, with 863 participants currently enrolled, the majority of whom are in Waterford College of Further Education. It is estimated that this budget measure will result in a reduction in their teacher allocation of four posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> The further education sector has expanded in the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its learners, and investment in further education has been maintained at consistent levels in recent years. It is now up to CEOs of the VECs, with their school principals, to look at the resources available to them and work to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both learners and employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and acknowledge the fact that he has conceded that four teaching posts will be lost. The figure is actually 4.6. That will have a significant impact on the ability of the college to provide its courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> The Minister of State spoke about savings of €12 million in a full year and €4 million in 2013, which is not a huge amount of money in the general budget. It is disingenuous to say that to amend this decision would mean introducing additional budget measures in education. The Government has, of course, the ability to raise taxes on higher earners or to achieve savings elsewhere in the payroll. I could give the Minister of State any number of examples.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> Given the small level of savings being made, it is neither economically sound nor right to achieve savings in this way. It will have the opposite effect of pushing people out of college. Whole classes will have to go because of this measure. It is not the right way to do things.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">I know how passionately Senator Cullinane feels about this subject. The seriousness of this issue surrounds the difficult budgetary constraints in which we find ourselves. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I, with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, had challenging and stark decisions to make in the run-up to the budget. We needed to protect those on the front line, the young children in primary and post-primary schools, for whom we hope to provide the best possible opportunity and the best quality of education with the best possible pupil-teacher ratio. Making those stark decisions obliged us to look at this option. The decision was not taken lightly.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> I have every confidence in the management of the VEC structure across the country to be as innovative as possible in responding to the challenge of delivering services with the reduced pupil teacher ratio. I agree with the Senator that it is a challenge. I am confident they will be able to do that and will continue to provide the kind of courses to which the Senator refers which will empower the unemployed to get back to work as soon as possible and will provide them with the skills to do so. </p>
