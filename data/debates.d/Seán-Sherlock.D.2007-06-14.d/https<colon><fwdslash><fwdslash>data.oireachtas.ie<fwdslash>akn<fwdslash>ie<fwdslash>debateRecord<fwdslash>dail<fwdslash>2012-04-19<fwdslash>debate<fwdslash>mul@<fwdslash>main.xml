          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have just learned of the sad passing of Mr. Paul Barry who worked in Leinster House for many years.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I convey our sympathy and sorrow to Paul's family.  He was an outstanding gentleman who was kind, courteous and represented the best traditions of the Houses.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The budget the Government introduced hit the lowest income groups hardest.  People on domiciliary care and disability payments, the pension entitlements of a large number of women and those in receipt of family income supplement were savagely hit by the budget.  Above all, the budget made a targeted, unnecessary and unacceptably harsh attack on lone parents which was initiated, endorsed and announced to the House at the time by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  Last evening, in debating the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, the Minister announced that section 4 was to stay.  However, while she is not deleting or amending the section, she has attached to it a conditionality that, in essence, suggests the measure will not proceed unless she secures agreement from her Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers for Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, with whom, according to her comments last night, she has not yet engaged on the issue, and, of course, the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether the Minister is a government within a government or a party within a party or whether the Tánaiste has particular difficulties with her.  Is it really on that a Minister would introduce legislation on a conditional basis without having secured the agreement of her Cabinet colleagues?  Why did she not see at budget time that it was unacceptable to reduce to seven years the age at which lone parent payments would cease and to have seven year olds at home on their own as the Government forced single parents and single women out to work?  Why is it only now, after protests and people raising issues, that she has suddenly had a epiphany or revelation that the measure is wrong?  She stated last night that she agreed with the proposition that the age of seven years was too young.  I put it to the Tánaiste that this is hypocrisy at its worst on the part of the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_4">The Minister's position is deceptive because it is pretending to make a change without making any.  Incidentally, I agree that it is wrong to reduce the age to seven years.  If the Minister and her Government colleagues are serious, surely the only honourable and sincere approach would be to withdraw the Bill or, at least, delete section 4 which gives rise to this provision.  It is not acceptable for the Government to come before the House with a Bill on which it has not reached clear agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">I join the Deputy in expressing my sympathy and sadness and that of the Government and Labour Party on the death of Mr. Paul Barry who served us so well in the Houses for so many years.  Paul was a man who showed great courtesy and offered great assistance to all of us and we are saddened this morning to hear of his passing.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The budget introduced by the Government protected those on the lowest incomes.  For the first time in a number of years, it did not increase income tax on working people.  It did not cut the basic rates of social welfare payments, as the Government of which the Deputy was a member had done.  It removed more than 300,000 of those on the lowest level of pay to whom that Government had applied the universal social charge from that charge.  This was done in addition to the decision to restore the national minimum wage to the level that had pertained before the Government of which the Deputy was a member cut it.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">-----and reversed the cruel measure introduced by the Government led by the Fianna Fáil Party to cut the minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The work the Minister for Social Protection is doing is to reform the social welfare system, something that has been long overdue and was neglected during the years, particularly during the good years Deputy Micheál Martin's party was in government.  The changes the Minister is making to the way in which lone parent payments are made go hand in hand with the changes to the way in which child care is provided.  Nobody is arguing or would argue that a child of seven years should be left at home alone.  That is nonsense.  The changes being made on a graduated basis and over a number of years are being made on the basis of changes being made in the delivery of child care services.  The Minister reiterated this point in the House last night when she made it clear that when legislation was enacted, its implementation was clearly dependent on the various reforms being joined up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_12">That is an extraordinary comment by the Tánaiste, avoiding the core point of the question.  If he agrees with the Minister, Deputy Burton, who perhaps believes she is Tánaiste in a different way, that the age of seven is too young for anyone to contemplate access to education or adequate child care on the Scandinavian model, why put this into the Bill in the first place?  Why make this decision in the budget to reduce the age to seven at all?  Is it in or is it out?  The Government cannot have it both ways.  This is classic Labour Party stuff.  A bit of pressure comes on so we pretend to people that we will change but leave it in.  Surely the only honourable and sincere approach, if the Tánaiste really believes that the age of seven is too young, is simply to delete section 4 and leave things as they are.  That is the only sincere approach and it is a classic example of the Labour Party wrestling with its conscience, but the Labour Party always wins.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">What is going on is outrageously deceptive.  This Cabinet is bringing legislation before the House and is asking every other Member to debate it and agree with it, and the Minister says that she wants us to vote on a section in the Bill but she has not decided on it yet because she has to talk to the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and unless they give her a bankable delivery on a Scandinavian child care model, then she will not go ahead with it.  That is incoherent government.  It is a bad government process.  It is not collective Cabinet responsibility and has nothing to do with how legislation is properly brought before the House.  It should be withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to the House that he will propose the deletion of section 4 of the Bill?  If he agrees it is wrong and if the Minister for Social Protection agrees it is wrong, I am sure the Minister for Finance will not object, nor will the Taoiseach bring him into line like he did last Sunday.  This is ridiculous behaviour.  Can the Tánaiste confirm that this section of the Bill will be deleted?</p>

          <p eId="para_15">Deputy Martin knows very well it is quite normal practice that when legislation is brought before the House and enacted, there are provisions for the commencement of various sections of that legislation.  The proposal in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 is that for new recipients from May 2012, a one-parent family payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12, from January 2013 until the age of 10 and from January 2014 until the age of seven.  That legislation is being introduced in the context of reform of the social welfare system and of reform-----</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_21">Of course she has.  The Deputy has been long enough in government to know that when legislation is introduced, particularly reforming legislation - perhaps he does not know because he did not do much reforming - provision has to be made for the implementation of those reforms.  As the Minister for Social Protection has made clear, the changes in the social welfare system and the changes in the way in which payments are to be made go hand in hand with the changes in the provision of child care.  Those changes will be worked out between the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">The Tánaiste said that nobody would accept that a seven year old child should be left without parental supervision.  Indeed, his colleague the Minister for Social Protection has belatedly acknowledged that the age of seven is far too young for cutting off the lone parent payment.  Does he share that view?  Is he saying quite categorically that seven years is too young?  If that is the case, why does this remain in section 4 of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Is the Tánaiste now making a commitment to the Dáil and, by extension, to single parents and all parents, that the Government will be delivering a Scandinavian model of child care?  When might that happen?  Does the Tánaiste agree with the Minister for Social Protection or not?  Does he think that seven is too young to leave a child without adequate child care?  Is that the position of the Government, or is it simply Deputy Burton yet again being a lone voice?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_19">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_25">Nobody in this House or in this country would leave a seven year old without care of an adult.  Let us get that clear first.  This legislation is not about the age at which children should be left on their own.  Nobody would leave a child on his or her own at seven years of age and nobody is contemplating that.  The legislation is addressing the age at which the lone parent's allowance is payable.  What is proposed is a reform in the social welfare system which will, over a number of years, reduce the age at which the lone parent payment is made.  That goes hand in hand with changes in the delivery and provision of child care so that it will be possible to implement those changes over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">This is about reforming.  We have to understand that when we are reforming a system like social welfare or a system like the payment of lone parent's allowance, these things take time.  They cannot be done overnight.  They require transitional arrangements to be put in place, as well as work and preparation.  In this particular case, the reduction in the age for the payment of the lone parent's allowance goes hand in hand with the delivery of child care.  That is what the Minister for Social Protection has made clear and that is the position of the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_29">-----not just lone parents, but more importantly targeting the children of lone parents.  Less than two years ago, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin objected very strongly when Fianna Fáil reduced the payment of lone parents to the age of 14 in respect of children.  The Tánaiste and his party colleagues were very vocal at that time.  They understood full well that it was not fair nor was it defensible to make a move like that in the absence of adequate child care.  At that time, they understood that children need the care, supervision and guidance of their parent.  They understood that lone parents in particular need support as they care for and raise their children.  They have really changed their tune now.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">In its so-called reform, the Government will reduce the eligibility for payment to the age of 12, then to ten and then to the age of seven.  Seven year old children are barely out of their infancy and the Tánaiste wants to force their lone parents back into a labour market at a time when there are precious few job opportunities.  The Government's budget did not protect those who were least well off.  In fact, it reintroduced poverty traps, put in obstacles to work, particularly for single parents, and well the Tánaiste knows it.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The Minister for Social Protection has said categorically that she now belatedly understands that seven years of age is too young, that seven year old children need their parent, and that the parent of a seven year old child should not be forced back into the labour market.  Does the Tánaiste share that view, yes or no?</p>

Will he explain how in 1995, when he produced this leaflet in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, and the mid-1980s, when he supported a boycott of water charges, he argued water charges were just another tax on workers?

          <p eId="para_79">Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett might take the opportunity to do so now.  I can answer his question very directly.  The decision the Government has made on the future of the water supply will not result in the privatisation of services.  That is because the decision we have made is to establish a public State company, a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann, to be the water utility.  We have to examine the supply and delivery of water into the future.  One of the problems is that we have not faced up to them until it is too late or the last minute.  We already know we have a problem.  We saw this in one of our cities within the past two years when for a period of three or four months people were not able to drink the water because it was contaminated.  We also know there are issues, for example, in the supply of water to the capital city.  There are questions about the adequacy of the water supply to the greater Dublin area which will have to be addressed.  Therefore, we have to make provision to ensure that there will be an adequate supply of water delivered to households and businesses in the next 20 years or more.  We also have to make provision to ensure the water will be clean, that we will not see a repeat of what happened in Galway with the outbreak of cryptosporidium or what is happening in the south of England where there is already a shortage of water.  This means we have to make prudent provision for investment in the water supply over that period.  To address this - we have to do it on a national basis - the decision the Government has made is to establish a State company which will be a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann over the course of the next two to two and half years.  The company will work with the energy regulator to work out a way to provide for metering and charging.  On the contrary, it will not, as the Deputy has alleged, result in the privatisation of water services.  The thinking behind the decision is to ensure our water supply remains in public hands within a public utility established as a subsidiary of a State company.</p>

After the incredible plethora of different versions over recent days from different Ministers of what new raft of punitive local taxes, between home taxes and water taxes, they want to pile on the already hard-pressed people of this State, we need clarification.  We need it because the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party again, unfortunately, misled people this morning when he claimed domestic metering, at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro, is a significant water conservation measure when one of the leading engineers, Kevin Murray, who is in favour of water charges and meters for different reasons, says the idea that meters would significantly reduce domestic consumption is largely a myth.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_183">As we heard in the course of this debate last evening, there exists strongly and sincerely held views on this issue in all parties in the Dáil, including my own, and among the Irish people.  I commend everyone who has participated in the debate on the manner in which the debate has been conducted.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">While people may hold their own personal views, values and beliefs, we were elected as legislators in this Dáil, and with that come responsibilities.  As elected representatives and legislators it is important that we act to deal with the huge difficulties caused for women and medical professionals in this State by the current absence of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">It is important that we recall the circumstances that brought us to this pass.  Twenty years ago, in 1992, a 14 year old girl, a child, became pregnant as a result of rape and was suicidal.  The Government refused to allow the girl and her parents to travel abroad for an abortion.  There was a huge public outcry and thousands of people took to the streets to protest.  The case went to court and the Supreme Court ruled that "a termination of pregnancy is lawful if it can be shown that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by terminating the pregnancy; a threat of suicide can amount to a substantial risk to the life of the mother".</p>
          <p eId="para_186">In 2002 the Government sought to overturn the Supreme Court judgment and, with others, Sinn Féin campaigned against what was to be the 25th amendment to the Constitution.  That referendum was defeated by the people.  At that stage, there was a clear recognition that the matter at hand was not a black and white issue but a difficult and complex decision faced by women with crisis pregnancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Since then, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that this State violates the rights of pregnant women.  That ruling makes clear that there is an onus on this State to legislate under the terms of the 1937 Constitution and the decision in the X case.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Sinn Féin does not argue for what is termed abortion on demand.  We strongly believe that all possible means of education and support services must be in place for women and girls with crisis pregnancies.  However, in the case of rape, incest or sexual abuse or where a woman's life and mental health is at risk or in grave danger, Sinn Féin accepts that the final decision must rest with the woman.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Sinn Féin has analysed the Bill and a number of serious concerns have been raised about aspects of it.  Some of these concerns were echoed in the comments of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, during his speech last night.  These are issues which need to be discussed properly in a considered manner and with maximum cross-party consensus to produce legislation.   Sinn Féin believes the Bill should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage at which point it can be discussed and amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Governments have failed to deal with this issue for 20 years.  They have ignored the reality faced by thousands of Irish women.  Last night, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, made it clear that the Government must take action to deal with this long overdue responsibility.  He has given an assurance that the expert group will deal expeditiously with the very complex issues involved.  That is most welcome.  What is certain is that it is time for legislation to be finally enacted to protect the rights of women, as decided by the Supreme Court in 1992.  It is time now for the Dáil, and for us as legislators, to do what is right by Irish women.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_191">The debate over the past two days has been dealing with an extremely difficult issue for all concerned, particularly women faced with the kind of situation with which the legislation is trying to deal.  For more than 20 years successive Governments have failed to deal with the issue and have ignored the reality faced by tens of thousands of Irish women.  They have also left medical practitioners is a very difficult situation caused by the absence of legislation.  We must ask ourselves as elected representatives, as legislators, whether we want to leave women or the medical profession in the awful predicament caused by the current absence of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Irish people know this is not a black and white issue, but a difficult and complex decision faced by women with crisis pregnancies.  The people spoke in referendum and firmly placed the responsibility upon their Oireachtas representatives to deal with the issue by means of legislation where a mother's life is at risk, including through the risk of suicide.  The European Court of Human Rights found in 2010 that the rights of pregnant women were being violated by the State in its refusal to allow them to receive a lawful abortion if a pregnancy could threaten their lives.  That decision made it clear that the State has an onus to legislate under the terms of the 1937 Constitution and the decision in the X case.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Sinn Féin is not in favour of abortion but in the case of rape, incest or sexual abuse, or where a woman's life and mental health is at risk or in grave danger Sinn Féin accepts that the final decision rests with the woman.  We have analysed the Bill and we believe a number of serious concerns arise about aspects of it, some of which were raised by Government Deputies and others during the debate last night and previously.  However, it is our view that the legislation should go forward to Committee Stage to allow those concerns to be fully discussed and addressed properly rather than putting it off to another date.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Minister, Deputy Reilly, indicated last night that the expert group will report - I have been told it will be in September - and that the Government will act.  I hope it will act speedily and that there will not be another 20 year delay.  I welcome the Government's commitment to take action in this regard.  It is time for legislation to be finally enacted to protect the rights of women as decided by the Supreme Court in 1992.  It is important also that as legislators and representatives of the people we approach the issue in its broadest social context.  The Government must consider whether its broader policies are pushing more and more women into positions of vulnerability.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Is ceist cuíosach deacair í seo do go leor daoine.  Tá riail ann ón Chúirt Uachtarach ó 1992 agus caithfidh muidne, mar daoine atá gafa le reachtaíocht a chothú, cloí le sin.

          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I am only too aware of the sensitive nature of this complex issue and of the split it has caused among the people of this country, but for too long previous Administrations have failed to deal with this issue, which is as relevant today as it was some years ago.  I commend Deputy Clare Daly for bringing the matter before the House.  I hope because other Deputies have done so that my commendation of her does not ring hollow.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">When the Government was elected we made a commitment to the people that we would deal with this sensitive issue.  We acknowledged the recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, subsequent to the established ruling of the Irish Supreme Court in the X case.  We promised to establish an expert group to address the issue and to make recommendations to Government on how this matter should be properly addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">As it currently stands, abortion in this country is illegal, except where it can be proven, as a matter of probability, that there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, and that this risk can only be averted by the termination of the said pregnancy.  That is the X case judgment as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  In 2009 the ABC case was heard in the European Court of Human Rights.  Three women had argued that it was a breach of their rights that Ireland did not provide abortion for them.  The court struck out two of the cases, citing no violation of rights had taken place, and in the case of the third applicant, Ms C, the court found that Ireland had failed to respect the applicant's private life, as there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  The court accepted that Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case, is the current standing by which other cases are judged.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">In June last year the Government submitted a plan to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the ABC case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  In this plan there was a further commitment from the Government to establish an expert group, which would be made up of people from the appropriate medical and legal professions, and that it would be the findings of this group that would recommend where and how we should proceed.  While I am pleased that the expert group is compiled of such skilled and educated professionals I hope they have spoken with or will speak with women who have physically suffered this particular trauma.  Yesterday in Leinster House, with a number of other Deputies and Senators, I met some Irish women who had to go in the past to the UK for a termination.  We heard their harrowing stories and what they had to go through.  In the near future I hope there will be an end to those harrowing stories and that we will not have to hear them again.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The expert group was established last November and is to report back by the end of June.  It would be inappropriate for the Government to pre-empt the recommendations of the expert group at this stage.  We must ensure we end the practice whereby 12 women a day are forced to access procedures in the UK and elsewhere.  These women who find themselves in a crisis situation are not statistics.  They are our daughters, sisters, mothers and aunts, and we should not forget their partners either.  All of those people are real, rational human beings caught up in an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We are being asked to legislate for a human tragedy.  This is not like formulating other legislation.  This requires the most careful drafting of legislation.  If we are to learn lessons from the past the ensuing debate must be calm and rational because it is such an emotive issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">As a woman, I do not like having to vote against the Bill which, perhaps, does not go far enough in drafting adequate legislation or guidelines on this issue.  The best way to deal with it is not during Private Members' business but in a full session of the House.  I hope Deputy Clare Daly will agree with me.  In this case we should not pre-empt the findings of the expert group which may uncover something of importance.  I advise that we await its report.  That is the way I will be voting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyMcLoughlin" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</from>
          <p eId="para_204">I oppose the Bill as set out by Deputy Clare Daly as I believe the fundamentals, even its Title, are flawed.  The life of the mother already takes precedence in medicine, as, of course, it should.  In Ireland, thankfully, we have one of the lowest maternal mortality rates in the world.  Many of those who are pro-choice suggest young women who find themselves pregnant without adequate resources or the necessary support of a partner or family are vulnerable and at risk of taking their own lives.  In the Bill, as presented, this is a reason to allow a termination with no regard for the views of a professional psychiatrist in determining the mental condition of the pregnant girl.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">On 13 January the Government established an expert group to examine the judgment, as committed to in the action plan submitted to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in June 2011.  The terms of reference have been set out clearly by the Government.  The expert group will study the A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland judgment of the European Court of Human Rights and the implications for health care services to pregnant women and recommend options on how to implement the judgment taking into account all of the issues involved and the pressing need for action.  Last June the Government was required to submit an action plan.  This was done and it included the setting up of the aforementioned expert group.  This was accepted by the court and a further report is due in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The programme for Government is committed to reaching all of the aforementioned stages and we await the recommendations to the Government on how the matter can be addressed properly.  In the interim, the professional opinion of the doctor will determine whether there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman as distinct from her health.  If such a risk can only be avoided by terminating the pregnancy, that is, meeting the X case criteria, a termination can lawfully occur.  If the patient does not agree with her doctor's assessment, she is free to seek a second or subsequent medical opinion under Medical Council guidelines, or she could apply to the High Court for an order directing that the necessary treatment be provided.  If a doctor refuses to provide necessary life-saving treatment, the applicant could, in the first instance, seek a second opinion for the immediate management of her concerns and, as a follow-up, bring a complaint against the doctor to the Medical Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">No prosecutions under criminal provisions relating to abortion have taken place since at least 1975 when the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was established.  While I agree the scenarios as outlined are not deemed acceptable by the European Court of Human Rights, they provide for what will happen in the interim.  Deputy Clare Daly's Bill should be rejected by the House as it masquerades behind the risk to the life of the mother.  It is really an attempt by the Socialist Party to introduce full-scale abortion on demand similar to the position in the United Kingdom.  In fact, a recent press release by that party on its website reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_208">But we believe that it is only a first step for abortion to be legalised in Ireland in all circumstances.  We have waited long enough ... Over 100,000 Irish abortions have taken place in Britain for many different reasons, none of them easy, all of them valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I simply do not agree with or support this view.  This country should not be influenced by the <i>status quo</i> in a neighbouring jurisdiction and amend or change its laws accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I look forward to seeing the report of Mr. Justice Ryan to the Government July next which will allow for an examination of this complex matter in the proper manner.  No doubt the House will return to this subject after the summer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineCollins" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Deputy Áine Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Deputy Clare Daly has brought before the House an important issue which has been left unaddressed for a long time by successive Governments, in fact, for 20 years.  Obviously, action needs to be taken.  However, the Bill is not the right solution, nor is its timing right.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There is an expert group which the Government set up in January which is looking at the issue.  It is considering the A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland judgment and looking at possible options on how best to implement it.  Its 14 members are experts across a number of fields of law and medicine, covering psychiatric care, professional regulation and public policy.  It is chaired by Mr. Justice Seán Ryan who previously oversaw compilation of the Ryan report.  The legal and medical issues in the A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland case and the European Court of Human Rights judgment are complex, which was why the group was set up to provide analysis and recommendations.  We must await the findings of this expert and specialist group before we decide what action may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Many are frustrated by the lack of action who think this is just another working group; it is not.  The Minister has committed that action will be taken.  There are many, including Deputy Clare Daly, who are frustrated at the delay; however, waiting a little time longer to get this right is important.  This is a complex and delicate issue and it can be hugely divisive among families and friends and in society.  People on both sides hold strong opinions and emotions can run high.  It is a difficult subject for many of us, but it is one about which we must talk.  The debate needs to be informed and sensitive.  There are many personal stories that have recently been told and what came across strongly to me was that there was a lack of support for those who had to go through this process.  This is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed.  This debate needs to take place and understanding and empathy need to be shown throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">We are lucky in so many ways.  In Ireland we have one of the best records in the world in maternity care, which is so important.  The Government is committed to ensuring no woman's life will ever be put in danger.  We need a response that deals with all the issues involved, from the personal to the medical and legal.  That is why the working group was set up and I believe we should await its expert response for the sake of few months.  I will, therefore, be opposing the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomBarry" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
          <p eId="para_215">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill, against which I will be voting.  I believe in preserving and protecting human life.  This is an emotive and difficult issue and as such, it is easy to find merit in almost every single one of the many hundreds of representations that most Members and I have received in recent weeks.  What I cannot get away from is the fact that I know of two cases in which the pre-natal diagnosis proved to be incorrect.  In one case the family were told that their child would have Down's syndrome.  They had made peace with this diagnosis and after nine months were ready to welcome a child into the world with that condition.  However, they were to be shocked because the child was born perfectly normal.  In the second case the family were told that their baby would live for only a number of hours or days.  The baby's severe condition also had been misdiagnosed and the child is perfectly healthy today.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Bill addresses the health of the mother, rather than of the child, but it is my understanding - I have spoken to a number of health professionals to seek their advice - that it is very rare for a medical condition to present that would leave no choice but to terminate or endanger the pregnancy to save the life of the mother.  Where that is the only option, however, I would fully support that decision and, as I understand it, that stance is already taken in Irish medicine.  However, there is far too much of a grey area in the Bill, as it stands.  The risk of misdiagnosis is a major concern, particularly when we come to psychological and psychiatric conditions.  I do not want there to be a situation where we would have abortion on demand under false pretences.  As a scientist, I am well aware that there must be tolerance of errors in all that happens in science.  However, errors in this instance have fatal consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I support the Government's position in opposing the Bill, as it stands.  Under the programme for Government, an expert group has been set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Seán Ryan which will present its recommendations, I think, by mid-July.  We need to wait for its report.  At that stage the issue can be discussed further.  We have to be careful that we do not use exceptional cases to form standards for legislative change.  We have to be careful not to open the floodgates for abortion and to remember that every child is precious.  We need to provide support to the mothers who find themselves in this position in a non-judgmental fashion.  We need to look at all the other services that surround this, including adoption and support services, which are very important.  We need to tackle the underlying causes of suicide, which is an awful malaise in this country at present.  Abortion will not cure all the symptoms in the long term.  We need to be careful about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The expert group is examining this issue.  While I am glad it is being discussed, we should not jump to conclusions too quickly.  Opening the floodgates to abortion in this country would, I feel, be a retrograde step.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</from>
          <p eId="para_219">I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is a very sensitive issue, particularly for women because women do not own their own personal physical integrity and sexuality in the same manner that men do.  Therefore, it is an issue that has to be handled with care.  I see the introduction of this Bill not only as premature but, unfortunately, as serving not to enhance any debate but just to rehash traditional entrenchment of positions.  Given the country has been dogged by this issue for decades, waiting until the expert group reports back would have been more helpful and would allow dialogue across the board, not just among politicians in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It is a tough issue.  When one thinks about it, one immediately thinks about the people affected, in particular the 4,500 women who feel they have to travel to the UK to undergo termination procedures.  These are the people we represent, so it is not a case of "them and us".  As legislators in Parliament, we try to think of all our citizens and take everything into account as we make laws and decisions on behalf of the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">We are moving and have moved away from an Ireland where morality was shoved down people's throats.  The question is whether responsibility for people's moral conduct falls on the shoulders of Government or whether we go down the road of talking about the personal responsibility of the individuals involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">We have heard strong arguments why there might or should be abortion in circumstances beyond the X case, including cases of diagnosed problems with the foetus, which could see the baby die shortly after birth or during the pregnancy.  There is no point in repeating the details of those sad cases.  They were personal experiences and they cannot be used entirely as a basis to change what amounts to the fundamental principles of a country.  Legislating purely on the back of hard cases does not necessarily make for good and proper laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I will be voting against the Bill, which I believe is untimely.  However, it does open a debate and I welcome that aspect.  There are some questions I would raise during the debate.  The major objection to abortion in Ireland is religious but the rest of the Western world has no objections in this way.  In the book <i>Free and Female</i>, dating from some decades back, Ms Barbara Seaman put abortion as part of the lifelong struggle of women for effective contraception and to be able to take control of their own bodily integrity.  That is both liberal and feminist.  When we legislate, we do it with an all-inclusive paradigm for our society.  In short, it is not for the majority alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am against abortion in any form.  The grace of God is so liberating and provides so many options to get the best out of life despite our fallen nature, and we all have that.  Having said that, it is an ideal to aim for.  In an ideal world, there would be no unwanted pregnancies and no unwanted babies.  However, we are far from living in an ideal world.  An honest and a scriptural view is that things are getting harder for people, so what then for the weak in our society?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The western or First World is championing a freer and more autonomous society.  The freer and more autonomous people become, the more responsibility they assume for their lives.  They exercise that freedom by rejecting authority that seeks to nanny them.  Therefore, the dialogue we have has to be, first and foremost, about taking responsibility, particularly for women because, in fact, they are left carrying the baby or not.  In the first instance, there is a need for dialogue about not getting to the situation where abortion is contemplated.  In fairness, in this day and age, nobody should be having unsafe sex, with AIDS and all the sexually transmitted diseases we know about.  That has to be questioned as well.  How well and how much are we respecting our own lives and our own bodies in the process?</p>
          <p eId="para_226">There was certainly a time when much was prohibited on moral, religious and "the good of all" grounds.  To cite an example, contraception was limited to married couples on a doctor's say in the Ireland of not too long ago, but that is no longer the case.  It is hard to believe that not so long ago, notwithstanding our knowledge of the rise of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, it was illegal to sell condoms from a vending machine to encourage safe sex, but we changed the law in that area also.  What changed in our society that allowed us to get to that point where we would change the law?  Moreover, how destructive was that change, if at all, given these were foundations of our religious beliefs in the past?  Homosexuality is yet another example of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Perhaps the Irish, like the rest of the world, are maturing to the point that they can be trusted with freedom of choice.  In fact, although divorce became legal, marriage still remains very popular in Ireland and throughout the world, including the USA.  It could be argued that when people are free to abort, they will fight harder to keep their unborn babies by choice and they will value their pregnancies.  For those who do not, and I believe them a minority, they will be free to choose what to do with no legal pressure.  In other words, any legislation will not make a good Catholic choose abortion against her conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Abortion as murder, and therefore sin, which is the religious argument, is no more sinful from a scriptural point of view than all other sins we do not legislate against, such as greed, hate and fornication, the latter - fornication - being probably the single most likely cause of unwanted pregnancies in this country.  At the end of the day, however, it is the nature of religion to fuss over appearances above the truth and the inner state of the person.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have always believed human life is sacred.  As a human being, the taking of life is abhorrent to me.  However, the many debates and campaigns over the past three decades by the "Yes" and "No" sides of the issue of abortion shone a light on a facet of our society which was heretofore swept under the carpet, which, as we have found, pertained to many aspects of Irish life over the years.  Hearing the tragic stories from those who had made the life-changing decision to travel to obtain an abortion and the ensuing debate on this sensitive and very human issue exposed the complexities of the matter and the varying medical and other circumstances which impact on the life of the mother and her unborn child.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">While I believe, as other speakers have said, that Deputy Daly's Bill is premature, I acknowledge the previous Government ignored the responsibility not only to the women of Ireland but to the medical profession during its term of Government.  In December 2009 the European Court of Human Rights accepted our Supreme Court findings in the X case and its decision is now binding on Ireland to clarify exactly when a woman may qualify for a lawful termination of her pregnancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The expert group was appointed by the Government as part of its action plan submitted to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers last year, and it is now chaired by Mr. Justice Seán Ryan.  This group will bring their legal and medical expertise to the ABC <i>v</i>. Ireland case.  I believe their medical and legal expertise will take into account the ethical and constitutional considerations of this matter.  I believe we must wait until July and I do not support the Bill on that account.</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_234">The Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill seeks to address a remarkably sensitive and complex issue that conjures up various emotions, feelings and views on the issue of the termination of pregnancy in the case of a risk to the lives of pregnant women.  However, as in every complex issue there is another aspect, that is, the right to life of the unborn.  The Government is acutely aware of the sensitive nature of this complex issue and is currently taking steps to deal with the issue under the programme for Government.  The programme states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_235">We acknowledge the recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights subsequent to the established ruling of the Irish Supreme Court on the X-case.  We will establish an expert group to address this issue, drawing on appropriate medical and legal expertise with a view to making recommendations to Government on how this matter should be properly addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">To this end an expert group was set up on 13 January made up of 14 highly qualified people, each of whom is eminent in their own field of expertise.  These areas include obstetrics, psychiatry, general practice, law, professional regulation and public bodies.  The committee, chaired by Mr. Justice Seán Ryan, has been asked to examine the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, to explain its implications for the provision of health care services to pregnant women in Ireland and to recommend a series of options on how to implement the judgment, taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area.  The group is due to report to Government by mid-July.  I believe it would be unwise and premature to make any decisions until the group reports its findings and makes recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the fact that the Minister has confirmed that after 20 years, six successive Governments and numerous Ministers with responsibility for health this issue will finally be dealt with.  The introduction of this Bill is premature and legislation may not be needed to address the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  It may be the case that regulation will be sufficient to deal with the issue.  This is all the more reason to take our time and await the findings of the expert group.  As with all sensitive and emotive issues, there is considerable diversity in opinion and beliefs, whether moral, religious or ethical, as well as medical and psychological considerations.  This is why we should tread carefully.  We all have personal views but ultimately we must legislate or regulate so that the best possible outcome can be achieved for all concerned and not simply for any given interest group.  The expert group put together by Government has been selected take account of all these issues.  We await its report and, for this reason, I will vote against the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_238">I wish to share time with several Independent Deputies.  I understand the Acting Chairman has the list.  It is important that Deputy Clare Daly has introduced this Bill on the issue of abortion or termination of pregnancy and that it is being discussed today in advance of the publication of the report of the expert group set up by the Government.  Since we are a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, I believe the Government is obliged to remedy any breaches of it.  I realise other arguments have been put forward in this regard.  It will be interesting to see the findings of the expert group.  I believe a timeframe has been set.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">It is easy to suggest that we should wait for the expert group but we have been waiting for a long time and not only for this group.  Let us consider the history of this matter in the country.  It has been repeatedly delayed, leading to referendums, Supreme Court cases, various working groups and a Green Paper.  There was an all-party Oireachtas group set up in November 2000.  It published its report after 12 months of submissions and deliberations but failed to reach a consensus.  A fifth referendum was held in 2002 and it brought about the current position.  There is a good deal of divergent opinion and that is likely to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I am not keen on the polarisation by groups along the lines of pro-choice and pro-life because the issue is not black and white.  I wonder about the significance of some of the arguments these groups bring forward in respect of women who find themselves in the situation of having to travel to England or elsewhere to terminate a pregnancy.  We know such a decision is rarely if ever taken lightly and I am mindful that there are serious consequences, including mental, emotional, psychological and physical consequences.  There is no doubt these consequences are compounded by having to travel outside the country.  The recent letters, accounts and testimonies in <i>The Irish Times</i> bore witness to these consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I listened to some of the contributions last night and today.  I cannot but be struck by the speeches on various sides of the House from Members to the effect that they support the idea behind the Bill but they will not vote for it because it does not go far enough.  This will make for interesting debate when the review group publishes its findings and any proposed resolutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Like many others, I do not agree with abortion on demand and I do not like the idea of abortion being used as a form of contraception.  However, there are times when a termination is needed and this reality must be recognised.  It would be great if no woman had to make that decision but that is not the case in the real world.  Even while we are debating the matter, some women are making the journey out of the country because they have made a decision to have a termination.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">If victims of rape and children who are pregnant through incest make the decision to have a termination, then it should be respected.  The case of where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of a pregnant woman is one such situation.  I have one concern about the idea of involving a psychiatrist and a psychologist.  This is derived from my involvement with mental health issues and the varying roles of psychiatrists in forced electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, treatment.  I have some doubts about their role in any decisions.  Any decision should be made in a non-judgmental situation with a doctor.  This is the way forward.  I hope that women from lower socioeconomic groups will not be discriminated against because of this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I knew a woman some years ago who became pregnant on her fourth child and who developed a life-threatening illness.  The medical advice was for a termination.  She made the decision not to have the termination.  The baby lived and she lost her life because she did not have the treatment in time.  That decision should be protected in law as well.  Whether a termination goes ahead or a woman continues with her pregnancy, the decision should be covered in law.  The Bill also covers those who object to having to perform the procedure.  The matter is well covered.  No one would be placed under a duty to participate, and provisions are in place for this.  While discussing abortion we should discuss the role of the father as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Although I support the Bill I am not in favour of abortion on demand and I dislike the way this issue has been hijacked by certain groups.  The Bill has a narrow focus for a particular situation regardless of the legal and medical point scoring.  I accept that maternity services in this country are excellent and it is the safest place to have a baby.  However, the situation addressed by the Bill does arise and such a decision must be protected in law.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_246">I am pleased to be able to speak to the Bill today.  I compliment all speakers to date.  I watched the entire debate last night.  Every elected Member is entitled to come to the House.  It is incumbent on Members to come to the House and voice the views they hold on this very difficult and delicate issue.  It has been a passionate issue during the past 25 years and long beforehand.  It is not black and white and it is remarkably difficult for all involved, especially for the women, sometimes young women, and their partners, close family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I welcome the fact that the Government has set up the expert group.  I am fundamentally and totally opposed to abortion except in extremely necessary cases which are life-threatening.  This much is already in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">There are 14 members in the expert group.  We must all hope, believe and have faith in the ability of the group to examine thoroughly the implications of the cases with which they must deal.  Those involved are suitably qualified and they were appointed on the basis of their qualifications.  They must deal with the terms of reference of the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Seán Ryan.  We should wait until the report is issued and then hold a further reasonable and continued debate if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The life of the mother already takes precedence and rightly so.  It is an emotive issue now, as it has always been.  I thank the many people who contacted me from throughout the country and I thank those of all views who have contacted all of us.  It is important that they contact us and that we respectfully listen to all sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I have spoken to medical experts and listened carefully to the contributions of Deputy Tom Barry and others.  The unfortunate reality is that there have been and can be incorrect diagnoses.  It was heart-rending to hear about the case to which the Deputy referred.  We cannot open the floodgates in regard to abortion.  Every child is special and a precious gift from God.  I was quite taken aback at Deputy Clare Daly's reference to this Bill in the context of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  There is no comparison whatsoever to be made in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The sponsors of the Private Members' Bill argue that the State is obliged to legislate for abortion on foot of the recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland.  That position is entirely false.  The judgment does not require Ireland to introduce legislation for abortion.  On the contrary, it fully respects the entitlement of the Irish people to determine legal policy on protecting the life of the unborn.  The legislation we are discussing is based on the 1992 Supreme Court decision in the X case.  Although my colleagues and I in the Technical Group work together, we all have different views on issues and can speak and vote as we wish.  As such, I intend to oppose this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Any revisiting of the X case decision must take on board the evidence from new studies that abortion involves significant risk for women.  In fact, the evidence over the past 20 years contradicts many of the medical assumptions on which that decision was made.  On the basis of current medical evidence alone, it would be irresponsible to introduce legislation in accordance with the ruling in the X case.  To do so would put at risk the life of the mother as well as ending that of the unborn child.  The suggestion that pregnant women are denied necessary medical treatment because of the pro-life ethos in this country is simply untrue.  In fact, Ireland is a world leader when it comes to the safety of pregnant women.  For example, the latest United Nations report on the safety of mothers during pregnancy found that of all 172 countries for which estimates were given, Ireland is out in front.  We have a great many problems in our health service, but this is a wonderful achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Supporters of the Bill seem to be wilfully disregarding this important evidence.  Many of those pushing for abortion act as though they alone speak for women going through unwanted pregnancies.  However, the research from which they quote and the persons on whose behalf they choose to speak are quite selective.  To be fair, that is probably true of both sides in this argument.  The supporters of this proposal certainly do not speak for the thousands of women who contemplated taking their advice but changed their mind and now cannot believe they ever considered taking the life of the children they adore.  We have heard from people in that situation and we see how brave they are.  Nor do the supporters of this proposal speak for the thousands of women who took their advice and now deeply regret the decision to have an abortion.  The emergence of groups such as Women Hurt further undermines the pro-choice claim that there are no negative consequences of abortion.  Of course there are negative consequences, as there are with most decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">This Bill is premature in a context in which the expert group is already at work.  I accept that there was a vacuum for a long time and that successive Governments failed to address it.  We are dealing with a very difficult issue and I would be the first to admit that women are more entitled to speak about it and more likely to understand all of the issues than I ever could be.  I am merely doing my humble best to represent my own views to this Parliament.  It is incumbent on me to do so and, as such, I will be voting against the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I congratulate Deputies Clare Daly, Joan Collins and Mick Wallace on bringing forward this Bill and opening up a debate on this very sensitive issue.  They spent months carefully putting the legislation together, but would themselves accept it is not perfect.  The whole purpose of having legislation pass through various Stages is to ensure the inevitable flaws are teased out and addressed.  I have pointed out in the past that the same standard is expected of both Government and Opposition in bringing legislation forward, yet the former has access to the expertise available in the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General.  I would contend that the defects in Opposition legislation can be remediated within the context of the various Stages through which Bills must pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Some speakers have described the Bill before us as premature, yet we have already had the 20th anniversary of the X case, in which time this Parliament has failed to place the judgment of the Supreme Court on a legislative basis.  If we take our role as legislators seriously, we must do what is expected of us.  Since the X case decision, abortion has been legal in circumstances where, as set out by the court, "it can be established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy".  The ratification of the eighth amendment to the Constitution in 1983 followed a very divisive debate in which abortion was presented as a black and white issue.  That amendment stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_257">The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Enshrining this principle in the Constitution did not prevent large numbers of women annually from travelling to Britain for terminations.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It was not until the X case that it emerged that the right to travel was constitutionally dubious.  That case involved a 14 year old girl who became pregnant as a result of a criminal offence and whose parents sought to bring her to England for a termination.  The ensuing debate encouraged a less black and white position on the issue and the emergence of greater understanding of and compassion for women in such situations.  The debate continues and was enhanced this week by the great bravery of the women who spoke openly about their very destructive experiences of having to travel abroad for an abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.  Their perspectives offer us a more nuanced understanding of the issues and are helping to shape public opinion.  I recall Martyn Turner's cartoon in <i>The Irish Times</i> at the time of the X case showing a child holding a rag doll caged into a map of Ireland.  The cartoon referred to the child as interned, which is essentially what it amounted to.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">In 1992 three constitutional amendments were put to the people, two of which were passed.  The X case and the subsequent C case generated considerable legal debate about the medical and psychological evidence relating to abortion.  The continuing uncertainty regarding the precise legal position presents enormous difficulties for the medical profession and may lead to more cases coming before the courts.  In 1995 and 1996 a constitutional review group chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker confirmed the need for legislation to clarify the circumstances in which abortions may legally be performed in the State.  In the absence of legislative action we have given the responsibility in this matter to the courts at a time of crisis for the women concerned.  In the X and C cases a 14 year old and 13 year old, respectively, were involved.  We in this country are very good at ordering reviews, but reviews often do not produce results.  We had a major constitutional review in the 1990s, which produced a Green Paper, but nothing happened as a consequence.  Instead the issue is left to ebb and flow.  The debates that preceded the establishment of those constitutional reviews and the debates that took place whenever a crisis emerged saw promises of action but no subsequent delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The four women who told their stories this week were incredibly brave.  A continuing dialogue on the issues they raised is very welcome in informing the debate on the matter.  The Minister has stated his commitment that the Government will not fail to address this issue.  However, the extent of polarisation on this issue between the two parties comprising the Government is evident.  An opportunity existed to take this legislation and mould it on Committee Stage in a thoughtful way when Members had the time to so do.  It could have been informed by the expert group, on completion of its deliberations, without the unnecessary delay that will now take place.  Instead, what will happen is the expert group will make its report, after which there will be another debate.  Moreover, I have heard this could be dealt with by some means other than legislation.  At some point, however, Members must take responsibility for making the laws and for determining the sets of guidance to be given to the courts, even in this extremely limited fashion, and I accept this Bill does not go far enough.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_262">In refusing to face up to its responsibilities to address this legislative void that prevents constitutionally-mandated safe and legal terminations of pregnancy, the Government simply is turning a blind eye to those silent victims and is accepting what one could call abortion tourism as a viable solution.  That is precisely what is being done.  I remind Members that 20 years after the Supreme Court ruled that a suicidal pregnant teenager had the right to an abortion because there was a real and substantial risk to her life, it is shocking that successive Governments have failed to legislate for the X case.  Only last year, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a women had her rights violated because the Government has failed to legislate for the X case but still no legislation is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Women who are unwell in their pregnancy should not be obliged to leave their country to safeguard their health but that is precisely what women in Ireland must do every week.  Moreover, medical professionals in Ireland should be able to fulfil their duty, as many of them wish to do, to protect the health of such women by providing abortions.  The people have given the Government the mandate to allow women the right to travel outside the State for abortion, to allow information about abortion to be available within the State and, crucially for this Bill, not to remove the threat of suicide as grounds for abortion.  In so doing, a majority of the people have demonstrated their support for abortion in line with the X case.  Depending on how the Government Members vote on this Bill, it would be or is abhorrent for the Government to continue to pursue the attitude adopted by previous Administrations by engaging in delay tactics, such as commissioning reports from expert committees, when a majority of people already clearly are in favour of allowing access to abortion in cases in which the life of the mother is in danger.  I can only view the establishment of the present commission as a tactic of appeasement towards a small group of fundamentalists in the country and the church.  The Government is washing its hands of the matter and is behaving like Pontius Pilate.  Its members are not man or woman enough to state what it wishes to do.  When the aforementioned commission makes its decision, the Government can then state it will do what the commission recommended.  Where is the courage from the so-called liberals in the Labour Party and Fine Gael?  It is gone as they are doing no better than did the previous Government.  The psychological distress due to rape or incest is well documented and is further magnified by a resultant pregnancy.  It is merciless of any Government to prolong the suffering of someone who is a victim of a heinous crime and for each day the present position is prolonged, 12 women leave this country.  The commission has been established since last November but Members do not know when it will make its report, which must come back to the Dáil.  Consequently, another year will elapse and the Government is prepared to see hundreds if not thousands of women who are in pain, distress and suffering leave this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Someone mentioned that were abortion to be introduced, the floodgates would be opened.  However, the floodgates already are open as thousands of people leave the country every year to have abortions because of our inability to uphold the human rights of the individual.  Ireland's proximity to countries in which safe abortions are legal has for far too long allowed Governments simply to transport the problem abroad and this will continue until this commission makes its report.  This has a consequence because what are those who lack the financial resources to obtain an abortion abroad to do?  Members should consider what is being done to women, whose human rights are being walked upon in Ireland.  Are they aware that many abortion clinics in the United Kingdom do not prescribe the medical abortion pill to non-residents due to follow-up requirements?  This means that as a result, surgical abortion often is the only option open to Irish women.  Moreover, the fear of judgment by some doctors and others can lead to a lack of post-abortion care uptake and further mental anguish.  I have to hand some figures released under freedom of information legislation - the Minister of State opposite may have them - that shocked me.  They revealed the Irish Customs and Excise authorities seized 1,216 packs of DIY abortion pills that had been ordered online.  Presumably, this enforcement may have prevented 1,216 pills from getting to those who ordered them but how many further orders got through for women to attempt home abortions without medical supervision?  What we are doing to women is outrageous and this issue has been neglected for too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I conclude by noting I am from Waterford, which is close to the port of Rosslare.  One can travel from Rosslare to Fishguard, which is the cheapest way to get to Great Britain.  Two years ago, before my election to the Dáil, I spoke to a 19-year old woman who had been obliged to endure a three and a half hour sailing on a ferry in January.  Anyone who has sailed on that ferry in the middle of winter would have known she would be physically sick both on the way over and the way back.  Moreover, it is intended to allow this to continue to happen for at least another year.  Where is the Government's courage?  Where is the courage of the so-called liberals in the Labour Party - I note there are very few in Fine Gael - to stand up and be counted?  The Labour Party should not allow Fine Gael to dominate it again, as it has been doing on all other issues since the formation of the current Dáil.  The Labour Party should stand its ground - as its members stated they would - for the thousands of women who will be left distressed until this so-called commission reverts with its report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I find it utterly incredible that anyone could have suggested - as have a number of Deputies - that this Bill is premature.  It appears incredible that 20 years have passed since the X case.  I first became active in politics about that issue around that time and my views on the issue were not then formed.  I did not really know what I thought but when the X case emerged, my views became very clear.  This was because the X case demonstrated the utterly inhuman situation that pertained in this State, whereby a 14-year old girl who had suffered the heinous crime of rape could be criminalised for seeking to terminate that pregnancy.  Moreover, at a time when her mental health meant there was a real and substantial threat of suicide, the State sought to criminalise her and her family for seeking to terminate the pregnancy.  All the abstract and moralistic discussions surrounding this issue were cleared away and the human reality of crisis pregnancy, particularly in cases in which there was a threat to a woman's life - in this case a teenage girl's life - made it clear for people in this country that at the very least, which is all this Bill proposes, in the case of a threat to a woman's life, she should be given the right to make that decision herself and this State should support her and provide for her in making that decision.  Could anything be simpler or more straightforward than that in the case of a threat to a woman's life, her decision and her right to choose should be upheld?  It is simply extraordinary that in the 20 years since that decision was confirmed in referendum by the people, Governments have been too cowardly to implement the will of the people and to introduce some degree of humanity when it comes to a threat to a woman's life when faced with a crisis pregnancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I pay tribute to Deputies Clare Daly, Joan Collins and Mick Wallace and all the other activists who worked on putting together the Bill.  I also pay tribute to the four women who came to Leinster House yesterday to highlight the tragic human reality of what it is like to become pregnant and discover that the foetus has an abnormality which is incompatible with life.  This is a terrible and tragic situation for parents to find themselves in and I have personal experience of it because my former partner and I had a daughter who was born with a genetic abnormality which was incompatible with life.  The type of situation to which I refer is an awful one for anybody to experience.  In such a situation who, other than the mother, has the right to make the choice about what should be done?  Who else would claim that right?  People state they have their own views on this matter and they are welcome to them, but how could we do other than give to women who find themselves in the type of situation to which I refer the right to make decisions on their own behalf?  To do anything else would be inhuman.  That to which I refer is all that is being requested in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Women are being forced to travel overseas at huge cost and to the massive detriment of their psychological and physical health and well-being to access the relevant services.  Some women who are suffering from cancer and other life-threatening diseases are being obliged to travel by boat to alien places with which they are not familiar and in which they have no access to support.  The financial cost involved for them is huge.  What is being done is absolutely inhuman.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Many Labour Party Deputies built their political careers on championing the right to choose.  They also spent many years demanding that legislation be introduced to deal with the judgment handed down in the X case.  However, they are now playing politics with this issue and kicking the can down the road such that thousands more women who will find themselves in the terrible and tragic circumstances to which I refer will be obliged to sneak off in the dead of night and travel across the sea.  It is not easy for women to cope with situations of this kind and it is not right that they are being denied support for their choices by the authorities in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I appeal to those in the Labour Party not to play politics with the legislation or make excuses about its proceeding further.  If they agree with the spirit of the legislation - I cannot understand how they could do anything else, particularly as they have for many years been saying what we on this side are now saying - they should allow it to pass Second Stage.  If it requires amendment and further development, they should allow this to happen on Committee Stage.  They should not kick the can down the road or sweep this issue under the carpet again.  If they do, thousands of Irish women will continue to suffer and be treated as criminals and with inhumanity by the State.  I appeal to Labour Party Deputies to support the Bill and encourage their colleagues in government to do so also.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_181" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Minister of State at the Department of Health ( Róisín Shortall)</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I thank Deputy Clare Daly and her colleagues for raising this very important matter and giving the Government the opportunity to restate its commitment to the expeditious implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland.  I also thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken on this issue for their thoughtful contributions.  It is a measure of the maturity of this House that we have been able to engage in a debate which has largely been free of rancour.  I commend Deputy Clare Daly for raising this matter and giving us the opportunity to discuss this critically important national issue with which - however late in the day - we are all trying to grapple.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">As the Minister for Health stated, the Government shares the concern expressed by Deputy Clare Daly in the Bill that pregnant women whose lives are at risk can access appropriate medical treatment, including lawful termination of pregnancy.  We have all been touched by the heartbreaking stories we have heard during the debate and that have been reported in the media in recent days and by the courage of the four women who have come forward with their stories.  One can only imagine the sadness and sorrow they have experienced.  As matters stand, however, their circumstances do not qualify them for a lawful termination of pregnancy in this country.  This fact would not change, even if Deputy Clare Daly's Bill were to be enacted.  This gives rise to a number of wider issues and challenges up to which we all must face.  We must set about addressing these issues and challenges.  The Bill does not do so and I am not sure whether what will emerge from the expert group will do so either.  We must recognise, therefore, that the particular appalling circumstances the four women to whom I refer and many others have found themselves in must be addressed at all levels within society.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">It is important to clarify that women in circumstances of the type under discussion are certainly entitled to a range of other services.  I refer to appropriate post-abortion services and care.  As stated in the Irish Medical Council's ethical guidelines, medical practitioners in Ireland have a duty to provide care, support and follow-up services for women who have abortions abroad.  In addition, the HSE funds the provision of post-abortion medical check-up and counselling services.  The executive has been rolling out a campaign to increase awareness among women that post-abortion services are available in Ireland.  Such services have been available for a number of years.  The abortion aftercare campaign which consists of targeted online and print advertisements encourages women who have had abortions to attend for post-abortion medical check-ups and also promotes the availability of free post-abortion counselling.  I urge all women who have had terminations of pregnancy to avail of these services, to which they are entitled and which are provided free of charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">As Deputies are aware, the risk of maternal death is the only ground for lawful termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  In the X case ruling a majority of the members of the Supreme Court held that where it was established, as a matter of probability, that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that this real and substantial risk could be averted only by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  This risk to the life of the mother includes the risk of suicide.  When, therefore, a termination of pregnancy is required as medical treatment to save a woman's life, it can be lawfully provided.  In fact, the Irish Medical Council already has guidelines in place to this effect.  They also make it clear that a risk to life includes a risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case confirmed that Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution was in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, what the court found was that there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable a pregnant woman to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  It ruled that “no criteria or procedures have been ... laid down in Irish law ... by which that risk is to be measured or determined, leading to uncertainty”.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I agree with those who have been critical of the fact that, as a country, we have failed to address this issue.  Many years have been lost with regard to the commitment to legislate for the judgment handed down in the X case.  It is, however, quite unfair to criticise the Government for delaying matters, particularly as it has only been in office for just over one year.  The expert group has been established.  We have made it very clear that we want the expert group to report within the six-month period.  As soon as that report is available, action will be taken to taken to legislate in accordance with its recommendations.  I assure the House that there will be no further delay and as soon as the expert group reports at the end of June, the Government will be absolutely committed to taking action in the area.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I commend Deputies Clare Daly and Joan Collins of the United Left Alliance, as well as Independent Deputy Mick Wallace, on bringing forward this Bill, the Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill 2012.  By doing so they have insisted that a real debate would take place in Dáil Éireann on the critical needs of women in Ireland whose lives are threatened as a result of pregnancy and who need a termination of pregnancy for the safeguarding of their lives but are denied this in the State at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The proposers have said that they have limited the Bill to such a scope because of the constitutional prohibition on the woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy in any other circumstances.  They wanted to give the Government the opportunity to accept the Bill.  I take issue strongly with the contributions of two Labour Deputies last night who claimed they would not support the Bill because it did not go far enough.  They did not elaborate in an honest fashion as to how far they wanted it to go.  Were they implying that they would support the right of a woman to choose in all circumstances?  They did not say.  The proposers designed the Bill to come within the constitutional limitations so that the Government could accept it and if improvements could be made by agreement, the Bill could be passed.  If the Bill allowed for a woman's right to choose, which should be the case in this State, the Government would have immediately seized this as a reason for rejecting the Bill on constitutional grounds, giving the Labour Deputies another excuse to prevaricate.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I cannot take seriously those Deputies who say they will not support the Bill because it does not go far enough.  If that were the case, the obvious action would be to support the Bill, which addresses one very difficult and critical issue, and then campaign for constitutional change.  The Government should accept this Bill and the area it covers, and it could widen the terms of reference of the expert group to deal with the broader issues of the thousands of women forced to leave this country for terminations of pregnancy.  That is the approach taken by the proposers of this Bill, which is correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_282">This Bill does exactly what it says on the tin, allowing for the termination of pregnancy in the case of risk to the life of a pregnant woman.  How anyone would have a problem with that is beyond me.  Six successive Governments have not done anything about this and the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, has said the parties have only been in government for a year.  She has a short memory, as the parties have been in government at some stage over the past 20 years and did nothing about the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">When the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, spoke, I had some hope of a response to the passionate speeches made by my colleagues, and he showed that he had a bit of a heart.  Disappointingly, after that I saw one person after another in Fine Gael make it quite clear that the <i>status quo</i> will not be changed by this Government, which is very sad.  Why am I surprised?  Listening to the combined argument of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on the matter, it should be no surprise as this country - those parties have continuously run it - has had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world.  Heels have been and still are being dragged on redress for women who suffered unnecessary symphysiotomies.  Heels were also dragged on the issues of women having to leave work when they were married, contraception and divorce.  In the past those parties have had a problem with extra-marital sex, and we have heard that a member of a Government party has a problem with fornication.  Where are we going?  It is quite clear that Archbishop McQuaid’s crozier is still firmly around people’s necks.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">There is a bit of hope as the Labour Party has been more positive, and comments from its members have given me some hope.  One comment made to Deputy Daly by a Labour Deputy showed that he was fully supportive of her Bill.  Nevertheless, we have heard elements in the Labour Party argue the Bill does not go far enough.  If the Bill survives today's vote, I hope the Government will continue to support it after the expert group reports, but it will not.  If those in the Labour Party are worried that it does not go far enough, they should remember that the Government will not support the recommendations of the expert group.  I have listened to the comments today and the Labour Party should remember them.  It is a bit like a child being offered three spuds by his mammy at dinner but he wants four or else he will eat nothing.  Generally, the child in that position will have no dinner.  The Labour Party will end up with no dinner either and get nothing of what it wants.  It will end up with the Fine Gael philosophy which is driven by Archbishop McQuaid's ideas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_285">Deputy Flanagan is always a hard act to follow.  It is a welcome development that we have spent almost three hours discussing for the first time in the State the issue of abortion rights in a relatively positive way, albeit within limited scope.  The discussion has been generally cordial and courteous, with a good tone and engaging debate.  People constructively engaged in a balanced way and the fact that we are discussing the issue in the first place has helped to move it on, perhaps in society at large more than in here, if the comments from previous speakers are taken into account.  The issue has touched every family and has often gone on with stigma and without discussion.  I am very happy to be part of bringing such matters into the open.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Society is in a very different place from where it was even two decades ago.  It is a scandal that this House and its legislators have failed to keep abreast of the issues and put sufficient legislation in place in accordance with the wishes of the people.  It is good that we have heard different views, and that is part of democracy at work.  There is nothing wrong with that and I respect other people's opinions.  In voicing such opinions, people must back them up with facts, and some inaccuracies have been aired which I will correct.  It is our responsibility in these debates to make informed contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">There was an argument that our Bill will open the floodgates and lead to a position of abortion on demand, but that is a ludicrous assertion.  The Bill is incredibly limited and I am very sorry about that.  I would like to see it with more scope but it solely provides for permissible abortion and guidelines for same in Ireland where the life of a woman is at risk, including the risk of suicide.  There is no evidence that abortion being available increases the rate of abortion.  The Irish abortion rate is just as high as it is in countries where abortion is freely available but the procedures do not happen here.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">A number of Deputies referred to maternal mortality in hospitals.  I am very proud of those hospitals and the issues are not linked, so it disingenuous to tie them together.  There are countries with maternal mortality rates equal to our own where abortion is freely available.  Our Bill will not affect the mortality rates and it is more likely they will be affected by cutbacks being proposed by the Government for the likes of the Rotunda, which has a capacity for 7,000 births in a year and saw 9,000 births last year.  That hospital will see even more births this year and such issues, rather than this Bill, will jeopardise maternal mortality rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I reiterate the point made last night.  The only reason there have not been more cases of women dying as a result of our inaction is that they travel, often when they are sick or unwell.  Lives have been saved, not by this Parliament but by the safety valve of travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I wish to correct the mistaken idea that abortion has a negative psychological impact on women.  This view is bandied around as if it is an accepted fact.  The Royal College of Psychiatrists in Britain has carried out the most comprehensive review of this issue and its findings are clear.  The rates of mental health problems among women with unwanted pregnancies are the same for those who have an abortion and those who keep their child.  While some women who have abortions regret doing so, so too do some women who give up their children for adoption and some couples who delay having children only to find that they have left it too late.  Is regret not part of life?  We are not proposing that the solution to these tragedies is to introduce a ban on adoption or the compulsory rearing of children when couples are young.  Why should it be any different in dealing with the issue of abortion?  All the State can do in this scenario is provide supports for citizens to ensure that, where possible, they will not be faced with the challenge of unwanted pregnancy.  Measures are needed to provide for sex education, proper contraception, early screening and early intervention and to ensure people are free from violence and enjoy economic circumstances that are sufficient to allow them to raise their children outside of poverty.   However, when a woman needs to make a decision about an unwanted pregnancy, the role of the State should not be to interfere but to support and stand by her.  The decision she must make is never easy and is always made for the best reasons in the circumstances.  Instead of judging and condemning people, we should be dealing with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The Technical Group is aware and regrets that its Bill does not deal with all circumstances.  The reason is precisely as Deputy Joe Higgins outlined, namely, that under current constitutional provisions, we can only legislate for the scenario addressed in the Bill.  The most striking aspect of this debate is that every speaker has admitted, albeit grudgingly in a few cases, that we have to legislate for the judgment in the X case.  Most have also acknowledged that this is the wish of the people and that such legislation is long overdue.  While it is welcome to note that this is the viewpoint of the overwhelming majority of those who contributed to the debate, it raises the question as to why Deputies, as legislators, will not support the Bill.  Only two reasons were cited for their failure to do so.  According to the Minister, the Bill contains legal errors in the sections dealing with consent and penalties, respectively.  We are open to having the two relevant sections amended.  I note that the other sections dealing with the criteria for termination, right of appeal, duty of care on the medical establishment and so forth appear to be fine, which is great.  In that case, why not allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage at which point it could be amended?  Legal errors are not a sufficient reason to oppose the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The more favoured excuse used by speakers for failing to support the Bill was the existence of the expert group.  We were told it should be allowed to get on with its work and that we had to await its findings which would be more comprehensive in scope than the Bill.  The risk in taking such an approach is that we have heard similar arguments made many times during the years.  In such cases we had much talk and nothing was delivered.  The Dáil will be in recess when the expert group reports in July and will have a busy schedule when it returns.  For this reason, it will be at least one year before alternative legislation is put before the House.  Deputies who do not vote in favour of the Bill are condemning women and their doctors to exactly the same circumstances that have pertained for the past 20 years, in other words, women with unwanted pregnancies will be forced to travel.  This is not good enough, particularly in the case of the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We want the Bill to be improved.  To be fair to the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Róisín Shortall, they accepted that the expert group would not address broader issues than those addressed in the Bill.  For example, it will not deal with the issue of access to abortion for medical reasons.  Some Labour Party Deputies used this argument as a reason for not supporting the Bill.  Their reasons do not stand up.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I accept the bona fides of many Deputies who agree with the position the Technical Group has adopted.  As Opposition Deputies, we have limited means available to us to address matters such as this.  On the other hand, the Deputies opposite are in government.  After years of campaigning on various issues, what is the point of not using the opportunity presented by coming to power to implement and be a force for change?</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I listened with horror to the very poor contributions made by Fianna Fáil Deputies last night.  They exposed the reason that party has never delivered social change.  The many young men in Fianna Fáil should take note that their party will go nowhere if it continues with its current approach.  We had higher hopes of other parties.  I ask Labour Party Deputies to look into themselves on this issue.  In fairness, however, some members of the Cabinet spoke well in the debate.  The Minister for Health, for instance, indicated he would not allow this to be the seventh consecutive Government to ignore the issue of abortion.  I honestly and sincerely hope he is right.  The expert group, the main reason most Government Deputies cited for not supporting the Bill, will produce its findings in a number of months.  If the Government does not deliver on the commitments given by its Deputies in this debate, the Technical Group will return to the issue.  We will also push the Bill to a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">That said, the House has done a service in airing these key issues which have been buried in society for too long.  I look forward to discussing the issue again on the basis of a more enhanced provision than that which we are trying to make available today.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
          <p eId="para_430">I remind the Minister that I spoke last night on the importance of ensuring the Bill is worded as simply as possible in a language the people can understand.  The wording of some of the previous treaties have been complicated and difficult to understand.  The key words used in this treaty are simple and understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">We must deal with the facts.  There is no point in dealing with lies.  Members of the public must be able to discern what are the facts and what are untruths.  I will highlight some of the truths.  The truth is that we must balance our books.  Regardless of what type of economy we have, it is vital that we balance our books.  The original treaty in 1993 when the Single Market Act came into force and the Maastricht Treaty with the formation of the EMU dealt with many of the structural concerns people have.  The facts are being distorted by the Opposition.  I heard Deputy Colreavy mention yesterday that if we vote "Yes" in the referendum on the treaty that hundreds of thousands of people will emigrate.  The fact of the matter is simple.  Some 42,000 people emigrated from this country last year but there was net immigration into the country of 32,000. It is difficult, therefore, to comprehend that a Member would say that hundreds of thousands of people will emigrate as a result of the ratification of this treaty.  The Deputy also said that unemployment is increasing but we all know the statistics show that currently there is a slight decrease in the level of unemployment.  The Deputy mentioned that by 2015 one in ten people will be unemployed but currently one in seven people are unemployed.  Therefore, that will lead to a decrease in unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Deputy Mary Lou McDonald stated that none of the economists came out in support of the treaty.  I find that extraordinary when an eminent economist, Mr. Seamus Coffey, from UCC, wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_433">Of the internal imbalances it can be seen that Ireland was almost consistent in its breaching of the thresholds for the annual increase [this was during the boom period] in real house prices, the annual increase in private sector credit and the stock of the private sector credit.  These are symptoms of the credit-fuelled property boom that existed in Ireland at the time.  Given the large and persistent imbalances that can be seen it is very likely that this internal scorecard would have triggered an Excessive Imbalance Procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">During the boom time there would have been checks and balances in the treaty that was in existence at the time that could have ensured the current recession would not be as serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Mr. Coffey further wrote: "The expenditure rule would have put the country in a much stronger fiscal position to absorb the deficit and debt problems the crisis has created and it is likely we would have avoided entering an EU/IMF programme."  He was basically saying that if we were part of the treaty that was in place at the height of the boom, we would still have our financial sovereignty today.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I plead with people to deal with the facts.  It is vital we vote "Yes" for this treaty because future Governments must not put us back into the situation with which we are now dealing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_439">In the debate on my party's Private Members' motion last month it was claimed by several speakers from the three parties which support the treaty that it is necessary in order to introduce stability to the financial markets and to stabilise the eurozone.  It might well have that result, although there is nothing currently to suggest it will, but it would be on the basis on a new dispensation inimical to the interests of the majority of the citizens of this State and of all other EU States and members of the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The people of this State are being asked in this referendum to make a choice between two negative outcomes.  On the one hand, they are being asked to agree to a further surrender of whatever limited sovereignty remains while, on the other, they are being threatened that if they do not this State will face financial ruin.  It could be argued that we have already embarked on the latter course.  While the banks and the bondholders have been bailed out, we have already witnessed the consequences that is having for huge numbers of people and for society itself.  People, whether in employment or dependent on social welfare, have seen their personal incomes drastically eroded.  The existing economic downturn has been also greatly exacerbated by the politics of austerity.  The previous Deputy referred to emigration and said that 45,000 people left the country last year.  I know from my experience, and I am sure every rural Deputy and some urban Deputies could state quite categorically, that the level of emigration from Ireland at this point in time is accelerating with young people leaving on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">There are far more people unemployed now than there were when the current disastrous course was embarked upon by the previous Government, only to be continued, despite their earnest pledges, by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the lead up to the general election.  Unemployment in this State averaged under 5% on an annual basis between 2000 and 2008.  We all know what took place at the end of 2008 when the disastrous decision was taken in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  Unemployment rocketed after that and now stands at 14% and it is far higher than that in many constituencies.  In my constituency it is more than 26%.  That can be compared to the EU average of less than 10% and that figure is skewed by the high rates in this State and those others at the hard end of EU broken austerity programmes imposed upon their citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We are all aware that there was an economic downturn but what is beyond doubt is that what was a European and a global downturn that impacted here has been made far worse by the current policies pursued by the Government.  Recession led to an increase in debt and unemployment levels but these would not be on the current scale had it not been decided to incorporate into the sovereign debt the debts of the failed banks.  History also proves that one does not build economic recovery through the sort of austerity programme being imposed on this State and elsewhere throughout the EU due in large part to elected governments, going against their electoral promises, agreeing to implement measures dictated by third parties.  If we pass this referendum and sign up to a further surrender of sovereignty, even a new Government that is opposed to the measures will find it difficult to reverse them or to pursue a different course.  That is why it is vital we reject it and ensure we retain whatever financial and economic sovereignty remains so a future Government with more back bone would have the basis to reclaim what has been given away.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As I said in my speech on the Private Members' motion in March, it is noticeable that this time we are at least being spared the promises made during the Lisbon treaty referenda, particularly during the first campaign before the electorate had the audacity to reject the proposal.  During the first campaign we were promised jobs and never-ending prosperity.  When that failed to convince people, threats of dire consequences were used.  It could be said that it worked.  Given the threats being made, one wonders what further terrible nightmares will be conjured up if the people vote "No" this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">We have had some hint when supporters claim a "No" vote will mean this State will not be able to access any more money.  Of course, people are being told there will be no more money to fund vital services while those making the threats neglect to mention that the massive, unpayable debt we are saddled with now was incurred mainly as part of the banking bail-out.  The only time it is referred to is when the State hands over massive sums to pay off Anglo Irish Bank's debts and that if we did not do so, we would be punished.  They are possibly correct but that begs the question of whether we ought to be in a situation where external forces exercise such control over the State and can blackmail us into paying off the bank's debts, or at least as much of it as we can before the whole thing becomes untenable, as it surely will if the current course is maintained.  If we agree to the proposal in the referendum, and we ratify the treaty, that will further increase the powers of those external forces and their ability to dictate to the detriment of the majority of citizens and financial policy of the Irish Government.  That will mean, in the context of the current debt, incorporating the private bank debt, an unending vista of austerity dictated and imposed under duress.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">We have already seen the impact of the slashing of public services and the erosion of incomes on the economy.  There are still, however, those who fail to understand that it is having a negative multiplier effect on the economy.  Even relatively healthy sectors and individual enterprises are being negatively impacted and, in many cases, destroyed by the economic austerity policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">It is clear the rejection of the latest proposals to surrender further sovereignty would constitute a significant step in turning around things.  At the very least, it will mean if a more imaginative and pro-active Government succeeds the present Government, it will not be hamstrung by external forces having a veto on domestic policy.  We have been told consistently that if we do not do that we are heading nowhere.  We know, as was pointed out already, that emigration has significantly increased.  The Minister has tried to play down that but it is a fact that tens of thousands of young people are leaving the country each year, with as many as 65,000 this year, to never return.   When young people left in the 1990s and in the early 2000s, most would come back but now the brains and the youth of the country are being forced out by austerity and successive Government programmes that are detrimental to the common good of the Irish people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_447">Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ferris.  Sinn Féin is an internationalist party and our republicanism is a European and internationalist philosophy.  Cooperation with our European partners is essential if the State is to meet the economic and social challenges facing us in the time ahead but Sinn Féin believes in a different type of European Union, a union of equals, not a union in which the bigger states impose their decisions on smaller states.  Creideann Sinn Féin nach bhfuil an Rialtas seo, díreach cosúil leis an Rialtas deireanach, ag déanamh go leor ar son chearta shaoránaigh na tíre seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The eurozone crisis is part of a deeper crisis within international capitalism.  The treaty is the French and German strategy for tackling this crisis but in a way that favours big business and the wealthy, and that protects the interests of the larger states.  Sinn Féin believes the austerity treaty will not solve the eurozone crisis or fix the economy of this state; creidimid an mhalairt - táimid cinnte go mbeidh tionchar níos measa ag an gconradh seo ar Éirinn agus ar an Eoraip.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Government tried very hard to deny citizens their right to vote on this treaty.  It sought and secured changes to the final draft of the treaty in a brazen attempt to avoid a referendum.  This failed, however, and the people now have an opportunity on 31 May to reject what is a bad deal.  Having lost the referendum argument, the Government has now fallen back again on more traditional methods of winning a "Yes" vote.  As with the referendum debates on Lisbon and Nice, the Government and Fianna Fáil have resorted to trying to scare and to bully citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Once again the claim is being made that this vote is about staying in the European Union or the eurozone or leaving.  This is not true.  Ireland's position as a member of the eurozone is secure no matter what position we take on the austerity treaty.  The Government parties and Fianna Fáil also claim that if we reject the treaty, the State will be excluded from future help from the European Stability Mechanism.  This is also not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">This has been referred to as a blackmail clause.  It is also an empty threat to bully people into supporting the austerity treaty.  This clause is not an article of the ESM treaty.  It is part of the preamble and therefore does not have any legal standing, particularly if it is in conflict with the primary mandate of the European Stability Mechanism as outlined in Article 136 of the EU treaties.  This clearly states that no member state can be denied funding if to do so threatens the stability of the Eurozone as whole.  The Government also has a veto on the ESM, by virtue of having a veto over the amendment to Article 136 of the European treaties.  If the austerity treaty is rejected by the citizens, the Government should seek a further amendment to the ESM treaty removing the blackmail clause and should use its veto on this matter if required.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">There are options, and the threats now being made are as bogus as were the promises during the Lisbon treaty campaign that passing that treaty would create jobs.  Since that treaty was passed, 170,000 jobs have been lost.  The reason for such scare-mongering by the Government parties is that they are unable to find a single positive reason for the Irish people to support the austerity treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">There are very many good reasons, however, for believing the austerity treaty is neither a good deal for the State, for citizens or for Europe.  We have rehearsed the argument that the treaty will rigidly impose an austerity strategy that is failing across Europe.  We have examined an tslí ina bhfuil siad in ann é a dhéanamh and the dire social consequences of austerity are to be found in every corner of this State, in every household struggling to pay mortgages and household bills, on every main street where businesses are shutting down and in every hospital and school where reduced resources are hurting the sick and the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">We saw the pitiable pictures today, in the newspapers and on YouTube, of an elderly couple being evicted from their home.  All of this is the product of austerity which, plainly and clearly, does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The treaty will hand over significant control of fiscal and budgetary matters to unelected EU officials.  Whatever view a citizen takes of this or any other Government, at least by virtue of universal franchise, citizens can change the Government.  In every election we can make Governments and other parties democratically accountable.  However, we cannot do this with EU officials who are not elected by Irish citizens and cannot be held accountable by them.  Moreover, if the treaty is passed, the new 0.5% of gross domestic product structural deficit provision will constitutionally lock this and future Governments into austerity policies in perpetuity.  Ciallaíonn é seo níos mó gearrú siar do na seirbhísí poiblí agus níos mó cánacha.  If a future Government, one which was truly radical, sensible and realistic, were to opt for a different path, this treaty gives the European Court of Justice the power to impose fines of up to €160 million.  So much for our sovereignty and the Taoiseach's claim that he wishes be the Taoiseach "who retrieves Ireland's economic sovereignty."  Leis an conradh seo tugann sé níos mó d'ár gceannasacht dóibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Sinn Féin has argued consistently - the Labour Party did the same in opposition - that there are alternatives to the Government's focus on bank bailouts and austerity.  The focus, clearly, must be on investment, growth and job creation.  The Sinn Féin approach is based on fair taxes, investing in job creation, debt restructuring and growing the all-Ireland economy.  It is about protecting public services and those on low and middle incomes.  Sinn Féin has called for an increase in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank to stimulate activity in the real economy; the cleansing of the European banking system of toxic debts; debt restructuring agreements involving debt write-downs; and ending the obligation on the State to pay the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note and unguaranteed senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and other banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">For these reasons and because there is an alternative, the austerity treaty must be opposed.  Its debt and deficit limits are draconian.  It will mean decades of austerity imposed on a people crying out for investment in job creation and growth.  It means citizens will continue to pay for the greed of bankers and the bad policies of the former Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government.  This is wrong.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael have robbed themselves of any right to criticise the previous Government in view of how they are pursuing that Government's policies.  In fairness, Fine Gael is pursuing its conservative right-wing ideology, although I am sure some members of that party have reservations about the issues involved in the treaty which some of them voiced in an earlier debate.  Not that long ago Labour Party MEPs voted against measures in the European Parliament that are now part of this treaty.  One Labour Party MEP described austerity as a "a recipe for the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer."  Another said these measures "will kill growth, destroy jobs and derail recovery."  They are right.  I appeal to Labour Party Deputies to vote with their consciences and in solidarity with working people and against the Bill and the treaty.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection  (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
          <p eId="para_458">When I speak to the big multinational employers, many of them in Blanchardstown in my constituency, they tell me that one reason they continue to locate in Ireland is that they believe this country is committed to the European Union.  We have punched well above our weight in attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Companies such as PayPal, Google and Facebook locate in Ireland because they see it as a committed member of the eurozone.  In a globalised economy the eurozone is an important financial region, with a very large population of more than 400 million.  Multinational companies are interested in having a presence in Ireland because of the attractions we have to offer as part of the eurozone, as well as our corporation tax rates.  There is also the fact that we are English speaking and have a large number of very well educated young people.  I firmly believe voting "Yes" in the referendum will show Ireland is willing to play its part in building a more financially stable European Union and eurozone.  Voting "Yes" to the treaty will help to stabilise the euro and boost investor confidence in Ireland.  Voting "No" would bewilder American and other foreign companies which are planning their European investments.  It could threaten the hard won business opportunities we are building in China and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">There is a big advantage in staying the course with the European Union.  For a start, collective action to boost growth and investment offers a much better prospect of restoring the health of national budgets rather than sole reliance on austerity.  Our previous experience of such joint European action through the Regional and Social Funds, for example, was almost entirely positive.  Our roads and colleges are the legacy of these funds that we continue to enjoy today.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Ireland is not alone in its troubles.  Bank debts and unemployment haunt many European economies.  There is much more to be done to help beleaguered countries such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain, but I firmly believe we are far better off making that case with like-minded Governments inside the European tent rather than being a lone voice outside.  The Government has put a painstaking effort into rebuilding Ireland's reputational capital in Europe, the USA and the emerging global powerhouse that is China.  There are some indications that this effort is bearing fruit, notably in the confirmation by leading international companies that Ireland continues to be as much a magnet for inward investment as it was a decade ago, despite our severe economic difficulties.  A "No" vote would upend that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Countries do not have friends, they have interests.  That is particularly true of a small country which has successfully chosen to base its development and prosperity on being a trading nation.  It is in our interests to be inside every European Council, committed to national budget discipline as one significant but far from exclusive part of a strategy to promote growth and job security in every corner of Europe.  It is entirely contrary to our interests to take a reckless gamble now that would leave Ireland isolated, perplex our friends and exasperate those who are funding the State until we restore our capacity to do so ourselves.  We have seen where reckless gambling has taken us and we do not wish to gamble our future again.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">We are borrowing approximately €50 million a day to plug the gap between what we raise in taxes and what we spend.  There is no escape from fiscal restraint in our current situation.  To pretend otherwise is dishonest.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Voting "Yes" will give Ireland a safety net in terms of access to a special European assistance fund, if needed.  A "No" vote may give the appearance of independence, but it could require Ireland to negotiate emergency funds that might have tougher conditions attached.  I have lived in countries in which there was a default.  It was not an experience I would recommend to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">It is said truth is the first casualty of war.  Experience tells us that truth is also a casualty of febrile political campaigns; that is particularly true of European referendum campaigns in Ireland.  Here is one inconvenient truth that will be as valid the day after the referendum count as the day before, no matter what the result of the people's vote is - Ireland is borrowing about €50 million a day.  That cannot continue indefinitely.  Voters have to decide if they want Ireland to have continuing, although conditional, access to European funds while we work our way through the tax and spending changes and cuts to eliminate the deficit and restore our independent capacity to fund ourselves in the longer term.  I know we will experience a barrage of posters that will urge us to vote "No" to austerity, as if voting "No" could magically halt the austerity juggernaut in its tracks or reverse the disastrous bank and construction crash.  It is irresponsible to hold out the false hope austerity can be avoided in a country that is so highly indebted.  If we vote "No", we will not have access to the European Stability Mechanism which provides a helpful backstop in the form of an additional line of credit.  In the absence of access to such a credit line, we would have to move even more rapidly towards a balanced budget, involving adjustments far in excess of the tumultuous budgets of recent years.  As Minister for Social Protection and somone responsible for spending more than €20 billion, even in this time of austerity, I am conscious of how many rely on the support of social protection.  Voters would not forgive us for advising them to vote "No",  given that it would result in even more severe austerity and leave us without an important safety net.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">This leaves voters with a classic catch-22 paradox.  A "Yes" vote will give us a reasonable guarantee of access to funds, albeit under strict supervision.  A "No" Vote may give the semblance of independence, but it will require Ireland to negotiate emergency funds that will have identical, if not even more onerous, scrutiny provisos.  There is no escape, one way or the other, from fiscal restraint in our current situation.  There is no honest realistic choice in front of voters that offers an easy escape from unpalatable budgetary measures.  To pretend otherwise is to lead the country straight into a cul-de-sac.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">This week the Taoiseach and IDA Ireland announced that US pharmaceutical company Mylan was expanding in Dublin and Galway, with the creation of over 500 jobs.  It already employs over 700 employees here.  US companies such as Mylan, PayPal, Sky and Facebook locate in Ireland for a number of reasons, including access to EU markets and the eurozone.  That is the critical aspect about which people need to think.  The eurozone is an important regional market in a globalised economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">Voting "Yes" to the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union will show that Ireland is willing to play its part in building a more financially stable European Union.  There is a mighty advantage in staying the course with the European Union.  The signals from every corner of Europe are that collective action to boost growth and investment offers a much better prospect of restoring the health of national budgets than sole reliance on austerity.  Such a pro-growth agenda should incorporate initiatives to relieve the cost of bank rescues, a particularly onerous burden on Ireland but a vital ingredient of a general mix to assist, for example, Spain.  Bank debt is not exclusively an Irish issue. The arrival of Mario Draghi at the head of the ECB has significantly changed many aspects of that institution's attitude.  There is a lot more to be done to help beleaguered countries.  We are far better off making that case with like-minded Governments inside the European tent rather than being a lone voice on the periphery.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">As we have established in the course of the past 12 months, reputation means everything in the modern world.  Political scientists call it soft power.  It is the capacity to influence events and policies in the wider world that arises from the respect earned by national efforts and sacrifices to overcome a crisis.  I represented the Government in New York where I attended about 40 events and venues.  I received a strong message which was complimentary to the Irish people that we were doing our best to overcome the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">An opinion poll reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today finds that 30% of respondents are likely to vote for the treaty on 31 May; 23% said they would vote “No”; 39% were undecided, while 8% said they would not vote.  That is a large number of people who have yet to make up their minds.  Earlier today the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs launched the Government’s stability treaty online public information campaign and website.  This is the first part of what I promise will be a very vigorous and informative campaign.  We will be posting a personal copy of the treaty to every household.  The European stability treaty is just ten pages long and I urge every citizen to read it for himself and herself, but let me give a very short summary of what the latest European treaty is about.  It is about the health of the euro in our pockets and the need to put it on a long-term stable footing.  It is about ensuring foreign employers continue to invest here.  It is about having an insurance policy that gives the country access to a special assistance fund, should we need it.  It is about adopting a policy of good housekeeping which the country badly needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">The financial crisis that began in the United States in 2007 stemmed from US banks selling products to European banks.  It crashed against our shores with a vengeance, culminating in the intervention of the IMF last year, and has now truly moved from the periphery to the centre of the eurozone.  The very existence of the euro has been questioned by governments and markets.  One factor people must take into account is that there are those, on both the extreme right and the extreme left, who have never been in favour of the development of the euro and might even be pleased if the euro were to go down.  In this way, Ireland's problems are now the shared problems of all eurozone and EU member states.  We are living in historic times and while we all watch with anxiety and react to the latest dramatic developments in the eurozone debt crisis, we also need to stand back and think about the broader macro trends and historical forces that are behind the multiple crises of the past four years.  When we do this, we see that the unifying factor is change: change in the balance of power in the world economy from west to east, in the relationship between markets and states, and in the speed at which events unfold.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The question for politicians and citizens in all European countries is how to preserve the European way of life, our cradle to grave welfare state and the inherent decency and democracy of our nations and our Union in the face of such world historical changes.  Truly the onus is on all politicians and citizens in Europe to accept that to preserve and protect our way of life, everything will have to change, and now is the time to start changing for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Europe needs an entirely new approach to economic development, innovation, competitiveness and how the welfare state is funded and delivered to citizens.  We must radically change the relationship between states and markets.  If the events of recent years have taught us anything it is that markets have become too powerful relative to states.  Markets are supranational, while regulation remains national.  A 28 year old with an MBA from Stanford or Harvard is on the markets every half hour.  A second or two minutes is a lot of time to devote to Ireland.  That is the way the markets are working now and we must take that into account.  Governments and political parties react by having daily and weekly meetings.  European institutions react by having weekly, fortnightly, monthly and quarterly meetings.  The markets and the way government and politics are managed are on two different timeframes.  Politics has not caught up.  We must go further and fundamentally change the nature of finance so that it ceases to be "socially useless", as the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in the United Kingdom, Adair Turner, said last year and becomes instead a catalyst for the development of the real economy, technology, small business, infrastructure and employment.  That will also require greater funding for public investment at EU level.  We must radically change the nature and timing of political decision-making.  Time and again the current crisis has exposed the variable speed of democracy and markets.  Even if we succeed in restraining the velocity of market activity, we will need a fundamentally more efficient and certain method of political action.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I agree with the views expressed by Professor Seán Ó Riain from NUI Maynooth in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the stability treaty will help stabilise the euro in one’s pocket and help stabilise the banking, bond and stock markets.  I agree even more strongly when he says true recovery “will require European governments and institutions to rediscover their historical taste for constructive politics and building European solidarity”.  Voting “Yes” in the referendum is an important milestone on that path.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">In response to the speakers from the Sinn Féin Party, when I was in the United States recently I noticed the efforts that were made there - absolutely legitimately - by people from both parties in government in the North, including Sinn Féin, to promote Northern Ireland as a location for investment.  In promoting this country we must consider the advantages of being in the eurozone in terms of attracting important mobile foreign investment that is one of the critical engines for the growth of the economy both North and South.  For that reason alone, voters must give every consideration to voting "Yes" in their wisdom to this treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I welcome the Bill which gives us an opportunity to reflect on our membership of the EU.  It is also important - whether one is on the "Yes" side or the "No" side - that we have a constructive debate on the issues relating to the treaty and also the position of this country within the EU.  Fianna Fáil will support the Bill.  We look forward to campaigning for a "Yes" vote.  We have always supported the concept of a united Europe and have always taken a pro-European stance in the past.  Fianna Fáil has consistently argued in favour of holding a referendum to address the democratic deficit which is undermining EU efforts to tackle the crisis.  We believe the treaty is a step towards addressing the economic crisis and, as such, we welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The Government is grudgingly holding a referendum having made every effort to avoid it by watering down the treaty, as was verified by the German Minister at the time of the negotiations.  Cabinet Ministers have previously described the referendum as not very democratic, indicating a lack of respect for referring critical issues to the people.  It is important that it was ultimately decided to hold a referendum.  It is the only way forward.  It is also important that the Irish people, who have made huge sacrifices in accepting reduced wages, disability cuts and extra charges in the past two years, would be given an opportunity to debate the issues and to have their say on the treaty.  People around the country have made many sacrifices in recent years.  A household charge has been introduced and water charges are to be introduced.  The spend available to people has been reduced which involves people making many sacrifices.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">We are a small island nation on the edge of Europe and if we are to progress further as a country we must continue to be at the heart of the European agenda.  We have greatly benefited from our membership of the EU.  We have benefited financially and in terms of equality, education, infrastructure, agriculture and working conditions.  This was a different country prior to 1972.  We have seen infrastructural developments such as new roads from Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Wexford and Dublin to Galway.  We have benefited enormously in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">One to the major changes has been in the area of working conditions.  When I first began to work there were few legal requirements for working conditions, the work environment or overtime - in many cases for no extra pay.  The new working conditions that were introduced on foot of our membership of the EU have greatly enhanced this whole area.  We have also seen enormous spending in education and agriculture as another area in which we have benefited greatly.  I accept we have a problem with unemployment, which is far too high in this country and across the European Union.  I listened intently to the speech of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  She referred to the multinational companies that are coming to this country.  They are most welcome but, as the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, is aware, a significant number of people are long-term unemployed and find it difficult to acquire work.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">When I travel around my county and the conversation turns to the EU treaty, people ask me what is in it for the unemployed and the less well-off.  This is an area the Government must deal with in the next four to five weeks.  Certainly, there have been promises such as in respect of the five-point plan and efforts to get people back into a work environment, but the measures do not seem to be working and must be dealt with as we cannot continue to leave many people long-term unemployed.  Many of the long-term unemployed are still relatively young because they worked in the building sector and have found themselves with no job opportunities in the past four or five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Irish exports provide the success story.  The figure for exports which amounted to €24.5 billion in 1998 rose to €35.1 billion in 2010.  As the House will be aware, exports have reached a record level in the past year and the indicators point upwards, which is good.  There are 500 million people within the European Union which offers opportunities to export more.  There are also opportunities to become actively involved in other areas.  Most of the exports are by pharmaceutical companies which is to be welcomed, but there are also significant opportunities in the food sector on which we have not yet capitalised, although there is considerable food production by farmers.  The Food Harvest 2020 programme which was brought forward by the previous Government was adopted by the Government and there are great opportunities to develop the food sector and increase exports as we produce food in a green and clean environment.  That is what Europeans are looking for.  From the discussions the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, had in China in recent weeks, obviously it is what the Chinese are looking for also.  For that reason, I welcome the fact that the Irish Farmers' Association has come on board in favour of a "Yes" vote, as farmers have benefited enormously through farm payments from the European Union in recent years.  CAP reform is coming down the tracks.  It is important, therefore, that the passing of the treaty also reflect the fact that farmers will continue to benefit from the CAP because serious concerns have been expressed in this regard.  However, as I stated, the IFA has now come out and stated clearly that the best opportunities for the farming sector in the future will be within the Union and that we should be at the heart of it.  As the House will be aware, there are 300,000 employed in the agriculture sector which is an important one.  It is important, therefore, that we underpin agricultural production and that there be a successful outcome to the CAP negotiations.  The Minister has travelled to Brussels, as both Deputy Moynihan and I have, for discussions with the officials involved to ensure the views, reflections and ideals of Irish farmers will be included in the talks on the CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Overall, there is a need for a full debate on the treaty in the next four or five weeks.  We cannot take things for granted.  The opinion poll results today in <i>The Irish Times</i> show clearly that up to 40% are undecided, a big percentage.  It is up to us pro-Europeans to convince the people that a “Yes” vote represents the best way forward for them.  As I stated, we are an island nation on the outskirts of Europe and have benefited considerably from EU membership during the years.  I have always strongly held the view that we must continue to be at the heart of European affairs.  As the Minister stated, we have punched above our weight in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">We must state clearly that the moneys that we acquired from the European Union were spent wisely.  They were spent on the people through the development of infrastructural projects far beyond our wildest dreams 20 or 25 years ago.  This was supported by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the majority of the people.  The Fianna Fáil Party is strongly of the view that we should continue to be at the heart of Europe and reflect the views of the majority of the people at EU level.  It is up to all of us, in the next four to five weeks, to canvas, tell the story as it is and point out to the people that we would be far better off in supporting the treaty and voting "Yes" to it.  As I stated, it is important, both on the "No" and the "Yes" side, that there be a constructive debate, that there not be flag-flying with persons threatening each other or trying to pull strokes.  That is not what this is about.  It is about what is best for the people who will make their decision wisely at the end of May.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_490">I thank Deputy John Browne for sharing time with me to allow me to contribute to this debate on the European stability treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Few politicians in this House, either past or present, or any other elected body, have not at times questioned how the European Union is moving forward, but if we look back in time, we can see from where Europe came in the aftermath of the Second World War during which it was decimated and the ability of countries to come together to solve its problems collectively.  Recently I read a number of books about Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty who played a significant part in helping escapees in the Vatican and Rome during those troubled times.  If one considers how difficult it was at the time when Europe was torn apart by fascism and a war, one can see that the citizens of Europe have benefited enormously from the entire project connected with the Common Market and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In the past four years, since the crisis to which the Minister referred began in the United States in 2008 and then crashed into Europe with a vengeance, it has been an issue that the European system and institutions have been slow to react to put mechanisms in place to ensure the the European Union is saved from the worst of the financial and economic crisis.  It is vitally important, therefore, that we go out and sell the stability pact and fiscal treaty as being right for the people, as we have benefited enormously from being at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Given the democratic deficit in Europe about which my party has spoken, it is important that the treaty is put to the people in a referendum.  When it was negotiated in December and being finalised in January, my party called for it to be put to the people because of the democratic deficit.  We are delighted, therefore, that it is being put to them in a referendum.  During the 1930s, when countries across Europe were falling to fascism, we put in place the Constitution of 1937 which we are now seeking to amend to facilitate ratification of the treaty.  We should always recognise that our democratic institutions were strong at a time when other countries in Europe were doing otherwise.  This is a lesson for them.  The treaty aims to secure the euro which form a considerable part of the European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">It is important that I, as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, indicate that it is vitally important for agriculture and the agricultural community, particularly the food sector, to ensure Ireland is at the heart of the European Union.  Irish agriculture has benefited enormously since Ireland joined the then Common Market, or European Economic Community, in 1973.  There are significant exports from the sector to other countries in Europe and beyond.  In about one year we will be negotiating the new Common Agricultural Policy for the period post-2013 up to 2020 and 2021 and it is vitally important that we have a strong hand in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">During the years we have developed a world-class food sector.  Primary food producers have worked tirelessly and borne the brunt of considerable regulations to produce a world-class product.  We should acknowledge them and others in the farming community for the efforts that they have made to bring this about.  As we look beyond Europe, we consider the importance of achieving the targets set in Food Harvest 2020, about which Deputy John Browne spoke, but also ensuring the Government and its agencies fight in the emerging markets for an increased market share.  That is on the agricultural side, which is vital.  Everybody in the agricultural community and those interacting with farmers and the farming organisations are very strong on this treaty being voted upon on 31 May.  We must make every effort to ensure we get the message across that the interests of the agricultural community, which is now a huge industry, are best served by being at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">In addition, Irish economic and political interests are best served by being at the heart of Europe.  With regard to our economic interests, we have benefited enormously from being within Europe and we also benefit internationally by being the only English speaking country within the eurozone, which has allowed a huge amount of foreign direct investment to come to these shores.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Burton, when speaking in regard to being in the US and the many organisations she dealt with, made the point that we were all out there to sell the message.  It is very important that Members and everybody else talk up the Irish economy.  It is not that long ago the self-same Minister was using language that denigrated the Irish economy from other benches.  That being said, it is important we speak about what is positive in our country in order to attract foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Ireland is politically best served by being at the heart of Europe.  Because of our being at the heart of, and firmly committed to, all of the European institutions, we are seen internationally as being part of Europe and, therefore, as being a more attractive location for foreign direct investment and in regard to many other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">To recap, I certainly will promote the treaty across the country and canvassing at any farmers' meetings or agricultural meetings which will be held in the coming weeks.  We will focus very strongly on the benefits and encourage as many people as possible not alone to vote for the treaty but to campaign for it also.  This morning's opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> illustrated that this cannot be taken for granted.  Some of the opinion polls that came out a number of weeks ago gave the impression it was a foregone conclusion.  It is vital that we get out the message, in the first instance for our economy, growth and the ability to grow out of the present difficulties and circumstances.  We accept there was a slowness within the European Union to respond adequately and that we need to put in place mechanisms.  The flaw was inserted when the euro was first put together in 1996 and there are issues which must be addressed to ensure this treaty builds on the strengths of Europe to allow it to respond adequately and quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The second point concerns agriculture, which has been at the very heart of Europe.  Many countries are looking to the success of agriculture, which has been consistent in Ireland through the years.  While other European countries were sidelining agriculture and food production, now that it has come into its own because of the perceived shortage of food within the world economy, Ireland is seen as a place to produce it, which is important for our agriculture and food industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">It is vital we understand from where Europe came.  Over the past century, two world wars were fought for control of Europe.  The European Community, for all its flaws, has ensured generations upon generations of European citizens have experienced Europe without the difficulties and tragedies of war.  As I said at the outset, many articles and books, including one written by a former Labour Party Oireachtas Member, Mr. Brian Fleming, in regard to Monsignor Hugh Flaherty, which is a fascinating read, show the difficulties that existed in Europe during and after the war period.  We should always understand the huge political difficulties that existed, and the enormous tragedy and challenges that brought about the birth of the European Union.  We should always strive to ensure that Europe and the European institutions are democratic and secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">It is an easy soundbite to find the flaws.  If anybody stands up at a public meeting, they are guaranteed to get a round of applause if they mention the EU directive on crooked or straight bananas or something nonsensical like that.  That is not what we are debating.  We are debating the very future of our economy and of the young people in this country, including the people who have been forced to emigrate and who we will try to get back to our shores.  The only way we can do that is by having our small, open economy at the centre of Europe and by having a "Yes" vote on this very important treaty.  I commend the Bill to the House and I commend the referendum to the Irish people.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I support the treaty and its contents, as I have supported EU membership in the past.  In addition, I have always supported the proposal that we have a referendum on this issue, including before the correct opinion of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I support the terms of the treaty for two principal reasons, one being that the euro is our currency.  We decided on EU membership democratically and the consequences of coming out of or collapsing the euro are horrific.  Therefore, in the best interests of all the Irish people, I support our currency, the euro.  Second, I support the terms of the treaty itself, which is essentially about having national budgets which are balanced.  That is a good thing, and I say that in the context of our experience of the past few years and the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  I would have thought that, as Members of this Parliament, if we had learned anything from those years, people on all sides of the House would have appreciated the benefits of balanced budgets.  We take in taxation and, accordingly, we spend our money.  We should not go back to the days of Governments ratcheting up national debt or, as has happened in the past, Governments using public money to buy elections.  That has been said not just by myself but by people to my physical left, who have argued in favour of people voting "No", so, of course, they contradict themselves now.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">If we have learned anything from the years of the Celtic tiger and its collapse, it is the need for regulation.  This treaty, in fact, enhances regulation.  It goes back to the question of whether we want balanced budgets.  What is even more amazing - perhaps it is not terribly surprising - is that the people who purport to be on the political left, or, as I call them, the pseudo-left, would be opposed to regulation in regard to balanced budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">There is one issue in regard to any point that relates to European matters in this House, namely, there is a collection of people here who, irrespective of what the issue is in regard to EU membership, are opposed to it.  These are the little Irelanders who never wanted to be in the European Union in the first instance and who have a particular frame of mind with regard to the people burning turf, dancing at crossroads and such things from the past.  That is not what the people want and certainly it is not what industrial workers want.  They want employment and investment and we will secure these under our membership of the EU.  A previous speaker rightly outlined the benefits of EU membership for the farming community.  Speaking as a Labour Party Deputy and an urban dweller, the EU has brought great benefits to industrial Ireland and its workers in terms of equal pay, safety at work and such issues.  I believe these would never have come about or would never have been initiated had it not been for EU membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The use of the word "austerity" is the best those opposed to the treaty can come up with.  I am convinced that some of them do not believe what they say in this regard.  The treaty has nothing to do with austerity; in fact it is the opposite.  However, if one is against the EU and one wishes to make some points or have a go at the Government, one invents something else.  The invention of relating the treaty to austerity is false.  It represents the depths of hypocrisy from the people who come to the House and try to convince the population that they should vote against it.  These are the same people who were jumping up and down about the importance of a referendum on the treaty.  However, they got pipped at the post, much to their disgust.  There is great competition between Sinn Féin and the highly Technical Group to establish which would have the highest paid barrister in a court room.  That was part of the competition but this time they have lost out.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The perception among the people of politicians in general is low.  I have listened to some of the comments on the other side from those calling for people to vote against the treaty.  I heard some of them refer to Anglo Irish Bank.  However, most of them ran up the stairs in the House in September 2008 and voted to bail out Anglo Irish Bank and we are all aware of the cost of that.  Bailing out Anglo Irish Bank has destroyed the nation.  Yet these people come to the House now and try to tell us about the terrible austerity.  They contributed to the austerity and they voted for the bailout, which should never have occurred.  These people have no wish to be reminded of it.  I recall a very good poem written by John Kells Ingram known colloquially as "Who Fears to Speak of ‘98?"  I put it to the people who voted for the Anglo Irish Bank bailout that they fear to speak of 2008.  They have no wish to hear of their part in the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008.  This is where politics stands.  I support the treaty.  I hope that in the interests of the people at large and especially those of the 400,000 plus who are out of work that the treaty is successful because there will be no recovery and no change without the help of those in Europe.  Anyone who opposes it or who presents any argument in favour of its opposition, is guilty of nothing but humbug.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKenny" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_510">The treaty is about ensuring long-term stability and economic recovery, which will lead to growth and employment.  The treaty is also about ensuring confidence abroad and maintaining and enhancing the influence that the Government has built up with investors, job-creators and those in Europe and the world.  I take this opportunity to welcome the announcement yesterday of an additional 280 jobs in the pharmaceutical industry in Baldoyle in my constituency, Dublin North-East.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The announcements of job-creating investments in recent months have come about thanks to the renewed political and economic stability and, above all, thanks to the determination of the people, despite very painful sacrifices, to restore Ireland's economic health.  The past few years have not been easy for people but I believe Ireland has had no choice but to make certain decisions.  Ireland must manage its debt such that over time, taxpayers' money goes not into servicing debts but increasingly into public services and targeted growth initiatives to create jobs.  The treaty is also about ensuring Ireland has access to the funding that allows these public services to function and to ensure Government spending is maintained.  The Government is determined to return to the financial markets next year to raise money by itself again.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I do not agree with the arguments put forward against the treaty.  The proponents of such arguments have put forward no credible alternative.  Thanks to the Crotty judgment, Ireland is fortunate to be in a position that the people can vote on this treaty.  However, if we vote "No", as some advocate, Ireland will be left behind while the rest of Europe will proceed to work within the stability treaty.  Ireland would be deemed incapable of making decisions within the wider European interest and it would suffer the consequences.  Ireland would be left with no sovereignty and would depend exclusively on an IMF deal to keep the State afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Have those advocating a "No" vote considered the view countries outside Europe might take of Ireland, countries that might be considering investing in Ireland?  How do those on the "No" side believe Ireland would be perceived in the event of a "No" vote, given that Ireland is reliant on bailouts from the EU and IMF?  What policies do those on the "No" side have to deal with political difficulties in the event of a "No" vote and to access to European Stability Mechanism funding if the EU economy is still under-performing and holding Ireland back?  Voting "No" will not help Ireland's recovery.  If the stability treaty is about anything, it is about ensuring the great mistakes of the past are not made again.  It is about developing a sustainable, fair and people-focused economy in Ireland and throughout Europe in which public money is available for public services and job incentives rather than paying down debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I have also heard arguments asserting that Ireland should leave the European Union altogether.  This would be political and economic madness.  Ireland would then be completely isolated, the new currency would nose-dive in value compared with the main currencies of the world and we would end up in an economic maelstrom such as that Argentina and Russia have been subjected to in the past two decades.  If Ireland were to go down this path there would be no money available to spend on public services.  In all likelihood, Ireland would require the assistance of the IMF and another bailout, run by the IMF alone.  It would be far more unpleasant than the current bailout.  If the course advocated by the "No" side were followed it would result in no money for decent public services in the short term.  Our hospitals and universities would have no funding.  Hospital services would be curtailed and social welfare payments would be slashed.  I have no wish to see these things happen.  The programmes advocated by the "No" side are nothing short of economic lunacy.  I support the treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">I will do my best.  The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union is the proper title of what we are discussing.  It is more commonly known as the stability treaty and this is an apt name.  I have heard many of the contributions on the Opposition benches, although few have been reckless enough to support those in the "No" campaign, who claim this is an austerity programme and treaty.  They should remind themselves that it applies throughout Europe and that 25 of 27 countries have ratified it.  The majority of the people in these countries are not in austerity programmes.  Therefore, one must conclude that the language is completely inaccurate and they are using it for the purposes of their political gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Three issues are at stake.  First is confidence in the currency.  Second is an insurance policy were things to go further wrong for our country or the currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The third point to bear in mind is that we are seeking a solution to the problems that present.  Some people seem to be taking an approach much like in the television advertisement where the person is wishing the television licence would pay itself.  That is not going to happen.  We must take the bull by the horns in order to address the problem.  The reality is that the euro, the currency in which we engage in all the activities of daily life, is in a severe crisis and is being watched closely by the markets and the rating agencies.  None of us could have envisaged that the crisis would reach this point.  It is worth noting, for the benefit of the young students in the Visitors Gallery, the origins of the European project.  It emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War, during which the Continent tore itself apart.  In the years following that terrible failure of political engagement, it was agreed that the way forward was through trade, partnership and the establishment of common goals and purposes.  From its beginnings in the Marshall Plan the Union has developed into an association that has enhanced trade and secured peace and stability for the nations of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I was originally opposed, for various reasons, to the establishment of a common European currency.  I was privileged enough to be studying economics in Sweden at the time, under an eminent professor, Bo Södersten, who pointed out the problems he foresaw with the euro.  I only wish I had been in a more influential position back then because Sweden, with all good knowledge, decided not to go into the euro and has since protected its capacity to grow.  What we are talking about here is intergenerational debt.  People older than I who sat in this Chamber have destroyed our economy and burdened me and my contemporaries with enormous debt.  I do not want to see the next generation of Irish people burdened with the same debts.  Looking at the treaty from this perspective, its promotion of prudence, good housekeeping and responsible fiscal policy are clearly to be welcomed.  It is about hard work and ownership, and the hard work must be done by those with the bigger muscles and who are most capable of doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is important to clarify that nothing in this treaty will supersede our agreement with the troika.  Before seeking external assistance, most of us associated the IMF with basket case economies in sub-Saharan Africa and South America where people were at war with each other.  Now it is we who have lost our financial sovereignty and independence, with outsiders dictating to us what must be done if they are to continue lending us between €45 million and €50 million on a daily basis so that we can keep our schools and hospitals going and get on with civilisation as we know it.  The treaty is about a commitment to the future in which our sovereignty is restored and a better standard of living is guaranteed for all members of our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">As a Government, it is very difficult for us to put in place policies that are not populist.  However, we are putting the needs of the country ahead of that of the political party.  It would be easier to sit on the Opposition benches and ignore our responsibilities for the purposes of political gain.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">Some people in the Opposition parties are being very irresponsible on this matter.  On the other hand, I commend the Fianna Fáil Party which, unpopular as it has been in recent times, has opted not to destroy the country.  It is doing the prudent thing by the people in this matter.  However, there are some who are clearly opposing the treaty for their own political gain.  That is reckless behaviour.  The Sinn Féin Party, in particular, should be honest about the stance it has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The troika deal is not exactly what we envisaged as the way forward for our country as we approach the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the State.  It is a question of taking incremental steps.  There is no pixie dust or magic wand to fix the problem or if there is, I have not heard about it.  This is a complex issue and I strongly welcome the opportunity to put the proposal to the people by way of referendum.  It will allow people to take ownership of the decisions that must be made by considering whether their preference is for stability or uncertainty.  If the treaty is considered as a ship leaving port, with all of the European Union member states on board, the question is whether we have a lifeboat.  Voting "No" in the referendum will deny us access to that lifeboat, in the form of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, should we need it in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We are dealing with a complex issue, as is the case in respect of most Government business.  For those with a less engaged attachment to politics, it boils down to a question of trust.  Do they trust Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and the Independent Members who support this treaty or would they prefer to depend on Sinn Féin to run the country?  Fourteen months ago the people entrusted us to fix the situation for the betterment of all citizens, including those who have had to leave the country seeking work.  The treaty will not come into play until such time as the IMF has left these shores.  I hope to celebrate that day with great aplomb.  It is about confidence, not austerity; responsibility, not recklessness; and insurance, not blackmail.  I am happy to canvass for this proposal and I urge colleagues to do likewise.  The referendum date will be an important day in the history of the State.  A failure to ratify the treaty will leave us in a position of enormous uncertainty, with an unclear road to recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on an issue that is hugely important for this country and for future generations of its people.  As such, it is vital that we have a measured and calm debate.  Putting a gun to people's heads in the context of the horrific economic crisis we are facing is not acceptable.  Instead, we must all keep calm, clear and reasonable heads.  I am reminded in this debate of the historical treaty debates at the foundation of the State when the Irish people were threatened with war and dire consequences if they did not accept an agreement which divided this island with consequences of which we are all aware.  Let us deal with the proposal before us in a straight and honest manner with a view to ensuring citizens have all of the facts.  The Government should be truthful about the closet plans for the construction of a European super-state rather than seeking to con people with spin and misinformation.  Those in favour of the treaty are not telling the Irish people the truth about the bigger picture, which is of a super-state with battle groups and other paraphernalia.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I stand for a Europe of nations working closely together, with Ireland having a strong and assertive independent foreign policy.  That is what I stand for, clear and straight.  It may not be popular or considered politically correct by some in the old establishment, but it is my clear position.  Some of the language from Labour Party Members in the debate today is appalling, with words such as "lunacy" used in respect of those who challenge and oppose this treaty and references to the issue being used for political gain.  What planet are they living on?  There was also reference to "populist rants".  I will not take a lecture from the Labour Party on populist rants when that party played the most populist card of all before the last general election, with outlandish promises on a range of issues.  There were commitments to reduce taxes, cut stamp duty, spend more money, and oppose water charges and household taxes.  Its Members took all those positions in opposition but today they are lecturing us on the morality and ethics of populist politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It is not populist to challenge the political establishment in this country.  It is not populist to challenge those who have a larger project in mind.  In fact, it is sometimes a very lonely place to be.  The Government's policies of misinformation and scaremongering in regard to this referendum proposal are a disgrace and deserve to be challenged.  I have taken a keen interest in the progress of this treaty and its complementary treaty on the European Stability Mechanism.  The latter was authorised by an amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, which still must be approved by all 27 member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed it is the intention of the Government to approve the amendment and the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, treaty that it authorises, by a vote of the Oireachtas following the referendum on the fiscal treaty and assuming endorsement of the latter by the electorate.  I believe the proposed amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU puts economic and monetary union on a wholly new basis from that to which Ireland signed up under the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties and moves it closer to a fiscal union for the eurozone, with a range of supranational controls over national budgetary policy that are outside the European Union's present area of competence.  Ireland has a veto on this amendment as it requires unanimity among European Union member states before becoming EU law.  This puts the Government into a strong bargaining position, should it choose to take advantage of it.  However, because I contend that both the Article 136 amendment and the ESM treaty it licenses are in breach of EU law and in consequence are unconstitutional in Ireland, both should be put to a referendum of the Irish people in addition to the fiscal treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I raise this point in respect of the details of this debate today.  However, it also is important to challenge the manifestation of what I call the EU mindset in this House.  I refer to those who are opposed to Ireland having its own economic independence or its own independent foreign policy, which is an important issue.  Members of the Oireachtas have a duty to stand up for the Irish people and citizens.  They have a duty not to turn their backs on their own country and to serve their own State and this is very important.  The duty of any Senator or Deputy is to serve Ireland and its citizens and not any other wider project.  That is their priority and should be done carefully.  In respect of the broader debate, when the Referendum Commission issues its information pamphlet outlining both sides of the argument, I urge everyone to read both sides and to examine closely the sensible and objective concerns shared by many people.  People do not like to be forced into a corner and do not like a gun being put to their heads in respect of Ireland's economic policies.  Ireland is well able to look after budgets and to manage its own economic affairs and finances and people must grow up about this point.  I acknowledge we must be organised in respect of our finances and must understand the relationship between tax revenue and public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I welcome this debate and urge everyone to calm down in respect of the language used, such as the use of words like "lunacy" by colleagues in the Labour Party.  People should grow up and listen to both sides of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">I will go back a number of years to refer to the very first decision to join the EEC.  I was against that decision and over the years have been consistently opposed to that membership.  Consequently, I have been against both the Nice treaty and the various varieties of the Lisbon treaty.  I thought we were giving away too much of our identity and our sovereignty and that we were no longer masters of our own destiny.  My fear always has been that we would be swallowed up by the bigger fish in the pond that is Europe.  It is very important that this referendum be held, although it appeared for some time as though this would not happen.  However, decisions of fundamental importance to Ireland must go to the Irish people.  In two examples in recent years, namely, the bank guarantee and the bailout, decisions were made without reference to the citizens but citizens are paying for those decisions now.  People are being given the choice and an interesting survey appeared in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It shows the referendum will be a major test for the Government, as it appears the outcome is wide open.  According to the latest MRBI poll, the outcome appears to hinge on those who are undecided.  I can understand people voting “Yes” because that fear factor is powerful.  I believe it is significant that people over 65 are giving the treaty the strongest support.  However, strongest support for the “No” side comes from the age cohort just younger than the over-65 age group.  Another interesting point is that 66% of the pro-Europe side, who consider Ireland to be better in Europe, comprise the better-off and farmers, whereas those who are anti-Europe are the poorest voters.  This statistic speaks volumes as the current economic and political policies certainly are creating more poor people in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">My fear is the fiscal compact is protecting the central national economies of the euro over peripheral economies such as Ireland.  There is a huge question as to whether this firewall agreement is in Irish interests, particularly for those on lower incomes.  There is a vagueness that could be significant for future interpretation and the fear is that France and Germany could bring pressure to bear to institute greater monetary and fiscal union within the European Union.  In such a case, will this State bypass the Constitution?  How many more restrictions will be placed on national budgets?  In the meaning of the treaty, the Council issues recommendations to the member states concerned to correct the excessive deficit and gives a timeframe for so doing.  Non-compliance with the recommendation would bring further measures including, for the euro area member states, the possibility of sanctions.  How will Ireland cope with this?  I refer to aspects of the surveillance of Ireland's economic policies, as outlined in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's digest.  Ireland certainly could have done with surveillance some years ago during the Celtic tiger years.  However, those who should have been in positions of surveillance certainly did not so do, which has contributed hugely to the mess in which we now are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I can go along with aspects of the treaty.  I agree there must be budgetary discipline, that debt levels must be reduced and deficits must be corrected.  However, the problem is with the manner in which this will be done.  People are told they must swallow a bitter pill but when someone is ill, there is more than one remedy for dealing with that particular illness.  Europe will be dictating our budgets, tax policies, wages and pensions and Ireland's economic policy will not be its own.  If one considers the bailout, the main beneficiaries were those insolvent banks which had run riot.  Was it not nice of Europe to give a bailout in order that those Irish banks would have the money not to default on their debts to the French, German, British and other banks, namely, those debts which were accrued during the binge of property buying more than ten years ago?  Issues also arise in respect of voting weights which will be of serious disadvantage to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is interesting to read the views of various economists and politicians and to listen to the discussions of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the referendum.  There have been those who were in favour, those who were against and an interesting group of those who are against the treaty but who will be voting for it.  I refer to some of their arguments, which include the point that the fiscal treaty will require substantially more austerity measures in the medium term.  There are groups which simply cannot take any more austerity.  Moreover, the fiscal treaty will depress growth in the eurozone, which will have a significant impact on Ireland's external demand.  It will limit the measures future Governments may take during downturns and will undermine productive economic growth.  Nevertheless, those who articulated such views still intend to vote for the treaty.  One also has been told that regardless of a "Yes" or "No" vote, Ireland will have access to institutional funding.  An interesting aside is that if Monsieur Hollande wins the French presidential election, he has other ideas on the fiscal compact.  There has been a major emphasis on macro-economics but one cannot lose site of the micro side.  Euro fiscal restraint cannot be allowed to dominate over the real needs of ordinary and vulnerable people in Ireland and Europe.  I ask whether there is a social compact to this treaty.  I have read some of the documents produced by the People's Movement and agree with them that Ireland has other sources of funding.  I refer to Ireland's oil, gas, lead and zinc resources, which are continually given away for half-nothing.  I refer to the suggested progressive tax system, with particular reference to a wealth tax, as well as to one of the movement's suggestions about renegotiating foreign debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Moreover, while there are times when people claim we must do what Europe wish us to do, there are other times when we are quite happy simply to ignore Europe.  I have in mind a cause in which I am particularly interested, namely, blood sports, animal welfare and coursing.  Although many countries in Europe do not permit such activities, we continue on regardless.  I also am concerned about the military implications, because I am not sure that Ireland is not being drawn into something it will regret entering.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">Like previous speakers, I wish to be as rational and as calm as possible during my contribution to the debate on the Bill.  However, when one hears some of the accusations that have been levelled at Members on this side of the Chamber by those in Labour and Fine Gael, one would be obliged to wonder whether others are being rational and calm.  The treaty is quite a serious mechanism and I await the full documentation from the Referendum Commission in respect of it.  I perused the list of those who are members of the commission and I accept that they are all eminent individuals in their own right.  How are these people appointed and what qualifications do they possess?  Why are lay people not appointed to the commission in order that some sensible proposals might be put forward?  The result in one of the two most recent referendums was almost single-handedly affected by the actions of one Minister.  I am glad that individual has come before the House in order to listen to the debate on the Bill.  He is not on the phone and is neither texting nor tweeting.  For once, he is listening.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I refer to the Minister for Justice and Equality who almost single-handedly sank the ship when it came to the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries.  I hope the Government sends him on a holiday - perhaps he could return to Australia - and we can get someone to mind his house while he is gone.  If he is not out of the country while the referendum campaign is taking place, I am of the view that the ship will sink again.  The Minister has a penchant for uttering mealy-mouthed words and launching attacks on various individuals.  During the previous referendum campaign, he attacked seven or eight former Attorneys General and stated that they were all wrong.  That referendum was rushed and was opposed, for good reason, by the Technical Group.  I was a Member during the lifetime of the previous Dáil and I am aware that an inquiry carried out by one of the committees became extremely political in nature.  If we had achieved the type of inquiries the Minister had wanted, we might all be banished from this land for ever more.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The Bill before the House relates to the fiscal treaty.  People in this country are entitled to a degree of fair play.  Ireland joined the EU in 1973.  I was in favour of it doing so and, as a young man, I campaigned for a "Yes" vote.  I have also campaigned in respect of other treaties in the interim.  Everyone is aware of what happened in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  When we did not get the right result, the treaty was referred back to the people in a second referendum.  Certain Ministers and Ministers of State have stated that if the fiscal treaty is not passed, it will be referred back to the people until it is accepted.  Is that fair play?</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I find myself obliged to ask whether the Government has even a shred of credibility left to it.  During the past four years - and, in particular, during the 18 months prior to the general election - those who are now in government made various promises and launched many attacks.  People voted for them on foot of those promises.  On the previous occasion on which the representatives from the troika were in Dublin, they informed Opposition Deputies that, unlike Greece, Ireland is great because the Government has a huge mandate in respect of all the austerity that is being imposed.  The Government does not have such a mandate.  The parties in government campaigned on anti-austerity platforms.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, famously stated that it would be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  The Government obtained its mandate under totally false pretences.  How does it expect the electorate to support it in respect of this extremely important matter?  The electorate cannot support the Government.  To paraphrase the old saying, it is a case of "Fool me once and it is your fault, fool me twice and it is my fault".</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The people are sick and tired of trickery.  They obtained the exact opposite of what they voted for in the election.  They cannot take any more austerity.  What they want is fair play and recognition.  The first deal we obtained from Europe, the so-called bailout, was and remains a clean-out.  We received reasonable interest rates from the IMF in respect of that deal but our so-called European friends sought to rob us.  With friends like them, who needs enemies?  The ECB is charging us almost 6% in interest, which is in the region of 3% more than the rate being charged by the IMF.  However, it is loaning out money to others at a rate of 1% or less.  Who is it codding?  I contacted the previous Minister, the late Brian Lenihan - Lord rest him - on the fateful day when the bailout was agreed.  It was the same day on which my late mother was buried.  I asked Mr. Lenihan to come home and leave the deal on the table.  We fell out over it because I knew that we were being cleaned out.  I questioned him as to who had accompanied him to Europe to conclude the deal on the bailout and he informed me of their identities.  Not one of them ever stood behind a shop counter, ran a business or worked on a factory floor in their lives.  They are privileged people who do not understand how ordinary working people, ordinary unemployed people and ordinary small business people are obliged to live.  It is always the privileged who go abroad to represent us in these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The position is the same in respect of the Referendum Commission.  Ordinary people are being both forgotten and disenfranchised.  Both parties in government have given them the two fingers.  Those to whom I refer voted for a particular set of promises in the election but they have been treated to the exact opposite since the Government came to power.  As already stated, during the previous campaign the Minister opposite went on television and rejected the arguments put forward by all and sundry.  According to the Minister, everyone except him was an eejit.  He is Mr. Wise Man but he single-handedly sank the ship.  The double act that is him and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, will sink the Government.  Their disdain for ordinary people is despicable.  The Minister for Justice and Equality displays total arrogance towards Deputies on this side of the House each morning during the Order of Business.  He fires across insult after insult at Members on these benches.  He does so under the radar but nevertheless such insults are being levelled at people.  Deputies on this side are being derided and being accused of all kinds of things because their views are different from those held by the Minister.</p>

He was, again, very mealy-mouthed when he addressed the latter.  Those present were very direct in informing him with regard to what is happening and indicated that some members of the force do not even have access to patrol cars.

          <p eId="para_580">On 31 May next, the people of Ireland can allow the country to take another important step on the road towards economic recovery, stability and increased investment.  The decision we will take collectively on the referendum on the European stability treaty will have serious and real consequences for this country and its people.  There is a responsibility on all Members of this House, as elected representatives, to ensure that when people come to cast their votes, they will do so while in possession of all the information the require.  It is very important that the people should be properly informed on all the relevant issues.  The Government will certainly play its full part.  It will do so in measured and honest terms and I hope that everyone else involved, irrespective of what might be their views, will do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Ireland is on a very difficult journey to recovery.  The adjustments we have been obliged to make in recent years have had an impact on every man, woman and child in the country.  These adjustments have been painful but we are making headway.  Our international reputation is being restored and our competitiveness is improving.  The most recent official European Commission competitiveness statistics show that Ireland is now ahead of the EU average on almost every measurement.  In recent months alone, numerous multinational companies have shown their confidence in Ireland by committing to new investments here.  I want to continue and grow this strong flow of inward investment in the future and for our future.  We are all working together with one aim in mind, namely, recovery and regaining control of our affairs.  Each decision we make must be weighted against this vital goal.  We must evaluate whether particular decisions will move us forward or set us back and whether our position will be more secure or more uncertain as a result of such decisions being taken.  These are the questions we must ask ourselves.  The Bill we are discussing is short, with two sections and short schedule.  It proposes simply that the Constitution be amended to allow Ireland ratify the treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance, and that constitutional cover be extended over Acts adopted under it.  This treaty is neither too long nor too complex, with 16 articles in total and a few pages of recitals.  The Government would like the people to read it for themselves, which is why we have sent a copy to every household in the country.  Everybody needs to know what is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The debate must be about more than words on a page.  To reach an informed view, people must also see the new treaty in the context of the very difficult circumstances that have prevailed in the European Union and beyond in recent years.  The euro is approximately 20 years old and was built on a set of rules and consequences set out in the Maastricht treaty and enshrined in the stability and growth pact.  These rules were never perfect, although they were the best that could have been achieved at the time.  They were designed to support a single currency that had yet to be created.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Experience has shown that although much was right - the euro was established and became a strong and credible currency - the necessary frameworks put in place were not strong enough to ensure sound budgetary policies across the Union, and they were not sufficiently robust to deal with the turbulence of recent times.  The interaction between a serious sovereign debt problem in a number of member states and a wider crisis in Europe's banking sector has resulted in a draining of market confidence in Europe and the euro.  As this House knows only too well, confidence is essential to functioning markets and healthy economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Since the crisis broke, much has been done at the European level to set matters right.  The rules of the stability and growth pact have been strengthened through the six pieces of EU legislation adopted through a fast-track process last year.  Two more instruments aimed at guarding against future crises are making progress.  We have put in place stability mechanisms; the first was the temporary European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and we will soon have the permanent European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  Ireland has been among those which have benefitted from these facilities, and we have had experience of how those mechanisms worked.  We have also learned the necessary lessons.  There are now lower interest rates and more flexible instruments available than was the case when the EFSF was first set up.  This has been and is of direct benefit to our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">There is also an acceptance of the need for an equal focus on the drive for the generation of growth and the creation of jobs.  This is something I personally advocated since taking office and I look forward to working with colleagues on the European Council in the period ahead to see that this is kept central to every European Council agenda.  In all of this work we have been operating within the legal framework of the existing EU treaties.  At the meeting of the European Council on 9 December last year, it was clear there was a wish for treaty provisions to provide for a new order to underpin confidence in the shared currency, and members were prepared to enter into an explicit commitment to run responsible budgetary policies and be held to account for doing so.  The new treaty, formally known as the treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance in the economic and monetary Union, was negotiated with impressive speed and signed by 25 EU members on 2 March this year, and each signatory is proceeding with a process of ratification.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">This is the context in which the new treaty must be seen.  It is part of an ongoing effort to restore confidence and stability to the euro, the currency we all share.  In drafting the treaty, we did not begin with a blank page and we built on the existing framework of EU treaties and law which already contain most of what is included in the new text.  That is true of the obligation to run a balanced budget, set out in article 3, or the agreement to keep government debt to sustainable levels, as set out in article 4.  Some aspects tighten existing provisions but the main innovation is the requirement to set these rules out in a binding way at national level and ensure there is a correction mechanism that kicks in automatically if there is a danger of breach.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Is this a recipe for permanent austerity, as some have asserted?  It is not.  It is simply an agreement among all concerned to ensure a balance between money raised and spent in the shared interest of the stability of a common currency.  It will have consequences for Ireland but these are positive, meaning no future Government will be able to bring us back to the brink through reckless spending of the people's money.  Ireland's current economic position is certainly very challenging, although we are turning it around bit by bit, but it is not without precedent.  Many people in this country will recall the serious mess our country was in during the 1980s, when our debts threatened to drag us under.  On that occasion, we managed to adjust our course before it was too late.  The reckless boom-bust approach to economic policy making, as practised by some in the House on more than one occasion, cannot be allowed to happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">Through its commitment to a fiscal responsibility Bill, the Government has already made clear its intention to put in place the legislative framework to guard against a future disaster.  That we are now doing so in tandem with our European partners should be very welcome to all responsible parties in the House who never want to see such a crisis again.  The efforts we make in Ireland to restore confidence for investment and business in our country are working, and those thinking of making important investment decisions in the period ahead are naturally concerned about the wider prospects for European recovery.  We need the picture they see to be positive, and this treaty will make a real contribution to ensuring that can be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">When I work in various places around the world to promote this country, I am struck by how important it is to have a good story to tell, not just about how Ireland is today - bruised but recovering and looking to the future with renewed energy - but how and where we see ourselves in five or ten years.  I tell people about our confidence in ourselves and abilities, our educated and dynamic young people, our skilled and flexible work force and our pro-business and "can do" attitude.  I tell people that this country is one of ideas and ambitions, with a great future ahead.  During recent visits to the United States and China, the consistent message from both political and business leaders has been that they see Ireland's place as a fully committed member of the euro zone as a crucial element of Ireland's attractiveness as a location for investment.  When I visited China a number of weeks ago, the evidence of the interest in Irish firms exporting to China and investment here was exceptionally strong, and we must build on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">As I have noted, with every decision we must carefully consider if it will move us forward or hold us back.  That means we must enter into a serious and honest analysis of our position if we decided not to ratify this treaty.  I have heard voices from inside and outside the House who, in urging a "No" vote, have deliberately and disingenuously played down the serious consequences of their proposals.  They are doing the Irish people an enormous disservice.  If Ireland remained outside the new arrangements, we would be the only euro area country to do so; although we would not be pushed from the euro, we would marginalise ourselves.  There should be no doubt that this treaty will enter into force when 12 countries using the euro ratify it.  There can be no question of preventing others from moving ahead without it, and the train will leave on 1 January next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Much has been made about the link between the new treaty and the ESM, and I am sure we will hear a great deal more about that in the debate ahead.  It is logical that those prepared to offer financial support to others in a time of difficulty should be assured that those receiving it are prepared to run sound and sensible budgetary policies.  I want Ireland to have the same access as other countries to the insurance policy of the ESM, which is a critical reassurance for investors and potential investors.  The link between the new treaty and the ESM is quite logical but it makes the decision to be made on 31 May particularly serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The Government has made clear its intention to take Ireland from the programme it is in currently and back to borrowing on the open markets as soon as possible.  For that to happen, we must continue to make the necessary adjustments at home.  We need enhanced stability and a return to growth across Europe.  Beyond that, we need to be able to convince those considering lending to or investing in Ireland that their money will not be at risk.  I do not believe Ireland will need access to the European Stability Mechanism.  However, saying this is wholly different from saying we can appear credible to the markets without access to some backstop.  Having access to the ESM makes it less likely we will need such access.  Locking ourselves out of it makes our case much more difficult to make.  This is not a time for needless risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">A moment of true consequence lies ahead for the people on 31 May.  It is not an exaggeration to state the world will be watching.  In deciding that the State can ratify the new treaty we will send a signal that will resonate well beyond these shores.  It will send a strong, positive and confident message that Ireland is moving forward, tackling its economic problems, staying where it wants to be, that is, at the heart of Europe and in the mainstream of European development and progress, committed to a strong and stable euro and playing its part in bringing that about.  It will say Ireland is a place where people can invest and create jobs with confidence and certainty and a country where future Governments will take prudent and sensible decisions and will not take risks with the well-being of the people.  That is the true voice of people and the one I want to hear on 31 May.  There is only one positive choice, that is, to vote "Yes" to investment, stability and recovery.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_597">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate.  The issue I raise, while simple, is very important to those who are or, as the case may be, not at the receiving end of it.  I refer to the appointment of supervisors for State examinations, specifically the junior certificate and leaving certificate.  This year I have been contacted more often than in previous years by young, part-time, temporary and unemployed teachers who meet the criteria for selection as supervisors but who have for some years found it impossible to secure an appointment in supervision.  Such an appointment would provide supplementary income to help them make ends meet.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Last week's conferences of the teacher unions produced much debate about reduced salaries for teachers and new entrants to the teaching profession.  While that is a debate for another day, it is an issue related to the matter I raise.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">On taking office last year, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, issued a circular instructing schools to offer part-time or substitute positions to qualified unemployed teachers.  I commend him for taking action in that regard and ask him to avail of the opportunity to act in a similar manner.  While I accept that it may be too late to act in respect of appointments as supervisors for this year's State examinations as most of them have been made, the Minister should ensure those appointed to the reserve list of supervisors are drawn exclusively from the ranks of part-time or unemployed teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">I understand up to 12,000 supervisors are appointed each year.  Figures for 2010 indicate that only 7% of appointees are unemployed teachers.  My simple request is that the €9 million expended each year on the supervision of State examinations be directed towards those who deserve it most, namely, part-time, temporary and unemployed teachers.  Clearly, those appointed must be qualified and able to do the job to the highest standards.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_601">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State examinations.  The Minister does not have a role in the selection criteria for the appointment of superintendents of State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission has provided me with the following information.  During the period of the written examinations each June much of the integrity of the examination process depends on the manner in which superintendents perform their assigned tasks.  It is a critical role, one that has been performed with excellence, skill and dedication by thousands of superintendents during the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Superintendents have a range of important duties during a three week period in June.  These include the safe custody of the examination papers and completed examination scripts and the safe and proper conduct of each day's examinations in line with the rules and procedures laid down by the State Examinations Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">Some 4,700 superintendents have been appointed by the State Examinations Commission to almost 750 second level schools for the 2012 examinations.  This does not include almost 9,000 superintendents appointed locally by schools, mindful of the specific needs of each individual student, to supervise students with special educational needs.  Typically, examination superintendents are drawn from the pool of unemployed, serving and retired teachers.  They are appointed each year by the State Examinations Commission through public advertisement in the national newspapers, by issuing last year's superintendents with an application form and providing supplies of application forms for all post-primary schools.  Examinations centres can accommodate up to 50 examination candidates.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">In the main, the State Examinations Commission appoints experienced teachers as examination superintendents.  There is a long-standing policy of appointing unemployed and substitute teachers before drawing on other applicants.  It is considered that teachers' classroom management skills and experience of working with young people are equally required for the effective conduct of the examination superintending duties.  For reasons of examination integrity, superintendents are not assigned to their own school, any school in which they have taught in the previous five years, any centre in which they have a relative sitting an examination or within a 16 km radius of their home address.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">I hope I have responded adequately to the Deputy's concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, it does not get to the kernel of the issue.  I received the following e-mail from a constituent last week:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_608">... I'm just emailing you in relation to the selection process as to how teachers are selected to supervise our national exams in the month of June.  As a part time secondary teacher I've applied five years in a row and to no avail every year even though I know many retired teachers and principals carry out this work every summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">This sums up the message I am getting.  How many part-time or temporary teachers and how many retired teachers were appointed as examination superintendents in 2011?  The Minister of State may provide the figures later if they are not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">As I noted, the Minister issued an instruction to schools to appoint qualified unemployed teachers to new positions.  Could a similar instruction be given to schools in respect of last minute supervisory appointments, for which I understand they are responsible?  Surely, if the Minister can issue an instruction to primary schools on recruitment, he can issue an instruction to secondary schools on examination superintendent positions.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">I have full sympathy for the point made by the Deputy.  While he makes a logical and cogent case, if I am to be honest, we must speak to the independence of the State Examinations Commission in terms of the role of superintendents and so forth.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  The Minister for Education and Skills made statements on the role of retired teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">I respectfully ask the Deputy to put down a parliamentary question in respect of getting those numbers.  If he would like to communicate with me afterwards, perhaps we can discuss a mechanism by which this issue should be raised with the State Examinations Commission, so as to allow for a situation to exist whereby the person who wrote to the Deputy would at least have some sort of a chance, having applied for five years in a row, if I understand the Deputy correctly.  That throws up a particular scenario which, on the basis of common sense, should be raised as an issue.  There is a public issue involved and I have sympathy with the case the Deputy is making.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">I will talk to the Minister about this.  If it is an independent commission then there may be issues about how to approach it and the commission's clear and unambiguous role in this.  However, I certainly have sympathy for the view expressed.  I do not see why we cannot have - at the risk of being accused of ageism - younger, part-time teachers taking up these roles on an annual basis.  I will talk to the Deputy afterwards.</p>

          <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_259">
            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_615">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this extremely important issue.  It is very important given that yesterday was the final day for receipt of appeals from the small schools that face losing a teacher and face increased class sizes in September 2012.  This cut to the pupil-teacher ratio is a cut to front-line services which will predominantly affect small rural schools, schools of minority faith and Gaelscoileanna.  The Government tells us that this decision is based primarily on value for money and not on the ideology of the Minister, which I find hard to believe.  I am disappointed the Minister is not here, with all due to the respect to the Minister of State, given that he will be in the Chamber in an hour to take questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">This is a very important and emotive issue and it is being discussed the length and breadth of this country.  We all agree that savings need to be made across all Departments because the country cannot continue to run the deficit that currently exists.  However, why has the Minister put forward these proposals before he has consulted the value for money review which so many schools, boards of management and so on, lodged in March 2011?  These reviews allowed teaching staff and boards of management to highlight where the necessary savings could be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">Small rural schools are the lifeblood of rural Ireland.  The Department's own whole school evaluation report clearly demonstrates that small schools throughout the country meet the needs of pupils, parents and teachers.  One school in the report is described as a "warm, welcoming, inclusive school, where all pupils are cherished equally".  Another school is described as providing "very good quality learning experiences".  Another quote in the report praises "the total commitment and professionalism of the teacher and her staff in delivering a broad and balanced curriculum".  There are references to the school buildings and grounds being exceptionally well maintained as a location for the education of children, along with parents' efforts and willingness to fund raise for school infrastructure such as additional accommodation and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">The Minister has been disingenuous when he compares the pupil-teacher ratio in small rural schools and small schools with the larger schools.  He is not taking cognisance of the multi-class setting in the one classroom.  He also talks about increasing the choice of patronage.  The Church of Ireland bishops stated that "No single issue has in recent years caused such a degree of anxiety amongst our communities as this one."  A number of schools in the Longford-Westmeath constituency are affected by this.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">My local school is Ballynacargy national school, which faces losing a teacher in September due to a decrease in the number of pupils by one.  There are excellent teaching staff in the school.  Huge resources have been pumped in through the Department's summer works programme over the last few years, and also through local fund raising.  It is a fabulous school and it risks losing one teacher for one pupil.  I am a member of the management committee at the local playschool and we have increased our opening hours there in a bid to ensure that people from the locality do not move elsewhere to send their kids to preschool and as a possible result, sending them to alternative primary schools in the county.  We have looked at that and we believe that in a short space of time, the pupil numbers will be back up.  In the space of 12 months, that will cause a lot of disruption to the school and I ask the Minister of State to look sympathetically on this appeal.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_620">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  He says we all agree that savings need to be made.  If he agrees with that premise, then it is not enough to suggest that he change the pupil-teacher ratio without providing an alternative to make savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the budgetary measure relating to the staffing of small primary schools, to which I assume he is referring.  There is no scope in this year's departmental budget to reverse this measure or indeed any of the budget measures concerning teacher allocation at second level.  Furthermore, the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million, and €147 million for 2014.  There are no easy solutions to this challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">The Government has protected education as much as it can.  Far greater reductions in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools, but there are limits on the number of teaching posts we can afford.  In the case of primary schools, there is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level.  However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  As part of the budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">The schools concerned are those with four or fewer classroom teachers with enrolments of fewer than 86 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  With the notable exception of those Deputies who are in larger conurbations, we all represent constituencies where there are strong and viable rural communities, so we are very conscious of this issue as well.  The small schools will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.  Even after all these budget measures are implemented, small schools will, in relative terms, be better staffed than medium to larger schools, which are currently operating at a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.  The Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the 73 small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  These schools will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's staffing circular that is published on the Department's website.  The appeals board meeting is taking place this week and schools will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">A value for money examination of small schools, to which the Deputy referred, has been carried out and the Department expects to publish the analysis and findings of that in the near future.  I hope this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in examining the challenges ahead and how best to provide for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_628">The value for money report will be published in the near future but it is disappointing that this decision has already been made.  The Minister of State said that it is not fair to say that savings need to be made without saying where the savings should be made.  I wish to point to a school, Glen national school, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, which faces losing a teacher.  Its nearest school is bursting at the seams and without a shadow of a doubt in the near future people will be coming out from that school.  Instead of closing and amalgamating schools why does the Department not consider the possibility of repopulating existing schools rather than constantly expanding already large schools?  Why does it not propose taking pupils out of schools that are bursting at the seams and repopulating rural schools?</p>
            <p eId="para_629">We have talked about abolishing quangos.  The Minister's predecessor abolished a quango, the National University of Ireland, but the Minister reinstated it at a cost of €3 million per year.  Why was that done?  Maybe it was done to pacify and satisfy the Minister's academic friends.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">Who will make the decision in the appeals process?  Will it be made by the Minister or will he abdicate his responsibility and pass it over to somebody else?</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The Minister of State compared small schools and schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1 but that is not a fair comparison.  There are multi-talented children in multi-class settings in smaller schools.  The Minister of State knows that, as he, like I, represents a rural constituency.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">I ask the Minister of State to refer to this issue in the context of the discussion on opening up the patronage of many schools.  The Church of Ireland and other minority faiths have come out quite publicly and said that this will have a detrimental effect on small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">We talk about making savings but only yesterday we saw another ministerial adviser has been appointed and once again the salary cap, which the Government promised it would introduce when it came to power, has been exceeded.  These are areas where savings could be made.  That can be contrasted with a position where schools are at the risk of losing a teacher for the sake of one additional pupil being enrolled for one year.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board what I have said.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">With due respect to the Deputy, if he wanted to speak about a particular school in his constituency, I respectfully suggest he should have put that into wording of the text of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">I reiterate that the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million and it is €147 million for 2014.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, he said that there is a school in his constituency that is bursting at the seams and he asked why do we not take some of pupils out of that school and populate a smaller school in the constituency with them.  We are not in the business in this country of engineering solutions whereby we would go into people's houses and say they must put their son or daughter into a particular school because one school is bursting at the seams and another one is just about thriving.  We do not interfere with parental decisions.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_271">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_644">Commuters, small businesses, hauliers, farmers and families are now are being screwed by the rise in fuel prices for diesel, petrol and home heating oil.  The cost of filling an average car is approximately €112, which is making life extremely difficult for a great number of people.  The Government is making a windfall from price increases, as it takes in excess of one cent for every five cent increase in the fuel prices.  At current rates the projection is that the Government will take in an extra €64 million in VAT because of the price increases.  However, to date there has been an outright rejection by Government of any proposal to assist those who are struggling to put fuel in their car to get to work to pay for the septic tank charge, the household charge, the forthcoming water charges and the forthcoming property tax, never mind the small little issue of paying the mortgage on a house that is in negative equity.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">I acknowledge that international influences have forced an increase in the price of fuel on a worldwide scale but the domestic price of fuel has now reached an unsustainable level for many families.  In March 2012 fuel price inflation in the United States reduced by 4.3% yet in Ireland in the same period we have seen an increase in the price of fuel of 8.7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">Crude oil prices are now at a much lower than they were in July 2008 but the cost of fuel in Ireland is much higher and the cost of keeping a car is climbing on a daily basis.  In July 2008 when oil prices peaked, a litre of petrol here cost €1.36, which is 34 cent less than it costs today.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">I am aware the Irish Road Haulage Association, has proposed a fuel rebate scheme for excise.  I understand a working group has been established between the IRHA and the Department of Finance to discuss this matter and I hope the Minister can outline the progress in those talks to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">We cannot ignore the fact that the price of petrol and diesel consists mainly of taxes levied by the Government, including excise, VAT and the carbon tax.  That is in no small way facilitating the fuel laundering industry that we have seen develop here in recent years.  There were a number of instances of fuel laundering in my constituency and in adjoining constituencies last year.  That trend is continuing this year, with fuel laundering becoming a major factor and problem in the economy.  It is taking money out of our economy, out of the Exchequer, and forcing the Government into a situation where further taxes have to be increased.  That also needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">According to AA Ireland, the average motorist will require 150 litres of petrol per month which, at a rate of €1.70 per litre, costs each motorist €255.  The bulk of this goes in Government taxes.  In fact, it is €1,628 per annum in tax alone.  We cannot ignore the impact this is having on the spending of individuals, the price of goods and the cost of doing business.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">Higher fuel costs impose a greater financial burden on the poor relative to the rich.  They are least able to afford the cost involved in a changeover to more energy efficient fuels.  The bad news is that things are likely to get worse, with some forecasters predicting the cost of a litre of petrol could hit €2 by the end of the year, delivering a windfall in fuel tax revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">Rather than using the taxation system to run the economy into the ground, I am appealing to the Government to use the extra VAT generated from increasing fuel prices to reduce the overall cost of petrol and diesel.  The Exchequer would be no worse off, but it would help struggling families and the economy.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_272">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_652">I am pleased to take the opportunity to speak on matters relating to the high cost of fuel on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  In this regard, Ireland, like other countries, has experienced a significant increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel in recent years.  The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices in recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in northern Africa and the Middle East, with potential supply disruptions.  For example, the average price of auto-diesel in 2010 was €1.23 per litre compared to today's average price of €1.61 per litre, a difference of 38 cents per litre.  During this period increases in excise in the budget last year and carbon tax in the budget for this year raised excise on auto-diesel by just over 3.5 cents per litre, VAT inclusive.  The increase in the price of auto-diesel, therefore, is largely due to external factors outside the Government's control.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">The excise rates, including the carbon charge, in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent on a litre of petrol and 47.9 cent on a litre of auto-diesel.  When VAT is taken into account, the total Exchequer take as a percentage of the total price is 53.7% and 48.5%, respectively, based on current average prices of €1.68 and €1.61 per litre for petrol and auto-diesel respectively.  While the tax increases are within the control of the Government, these increases must be seen in the context of very difficult budgetary decisions.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that our rates remain lower than those of many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than those of our nearest neighbour, Britain.  The price of auto-diesel is around 20 cents per litre cheaper in the State compared to that in Britain, while the price of petrol is around 10 cents per litre cheaper.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  Accordingly, any increase in the tax take as a consequence of increasing fuel prices is confined to VAT.  It should also be noted that businesses are, of course, entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil, or green diesel as it commonly known, used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.  VAT on petrol cannot be deducted or reclaimed.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">Given the current pressure on the public finances, there are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.  In the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement in December he pointed out that the programme for Government stated there would be no increases in income tax.  The Government carefully considered the options open to it, given our commitments under the EU-IMF programme.  Indirect taxes have a lower impact on economic growth and jobs.  The decision to increase the carbon tax by €5 per tonne meant a lower increase across all fuels than if an increase had been applied just to the excise duties on petrol and diesel.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">Rising costs of fuel are an international phenomenon.  In 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices last spiked, the matter was considered at ECOFIN.  Given impact of high oil prices on growth rates, it considered an appropriate policy response to the price increase at its meeting of 3 June 2008.  It confirmed the agreement reached in Manchester in 2005 that the discretionary fiscal and other policy interventions that had prevented the necessary adjustments by economic agencies should be avoided.  On 15 March 2011 the issue of rising fuel prices was briefly discussed by EU Finance Ministers and they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">I ask the Minister of State to update me on what is happening in the case of the road haulage industry.  What is the position on fuel laundering?  There are cowboys who are running riot in this industry.  Each tanker of fuel costs the Exchequer €20,000.  As the fine is just over €126,000, with six loads, the launderers have already made a profit.  Securing a conviction in the first place is difficult.  Does the Minister of State agree that this must be tightened, with a stronger approach being taken to fuel laundering?  If fuel prices are maintained at current levels for the rest of the year, the Government will take in an extra €64 million in VAT.  It will argue that as fuel prices increase, consumer demand is dampened and that, therefore, there is no net benefit to the Exchequer.  Higher fuel prices, however, have an impact on disposable income and consumer demand; therefore, the opposite is also the case.  While there would be no substantial impact on the overall tax take for the Government, the benefit for the economy would lie in taking that €64 million and including it in a refund system for consumers.  The money would be spent on consumer goods in the economy, helping to support existing jobs.  It makes more sense to support jobs rather than balancing the books and taking the easy option, leaving people and families struggling.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">In addition to the ongoing enforcement action, legislative changes that will enable more effective control in this sector have been included in this year's Finance Bill.  They include the introduction of new licensing requirements for marked fuel traders.  The new arrangements will, for the first time, require any person dealing in marked fuel to hold a licence for the purpose.  The granting of a licence will be subject to tax clearance requirements and the applicant will have to show to Revenue that any conditions subject to which the licence may be granted will be complied with.  Revenue will be empowered to revoke a licence.  In parallel with the introduction of this new licensing system, the regulations that lay down the detailed rules and requirements in mineral oil matters are being reviewed.  It is intended that the requirements for record keeping will be strengthened and that a new requirement to make periodic returns to Revenue will be introduced.  All mineral oil traders, including traders in marked fuels, will have to make regular returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">Steps are being taken, in close co-operation with the British authorities, to acquire a more effective fuel marker.  Revenue is planning to go to the market shortly, with the British authorities, to seek a new marker.  A good deal of preparatory research has been undertaken both here and in Britain and we expect to proceed with this project shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The problem of fuel laundering and smuggling is a serious one and the extensive enforcement action being taken on an ongoing basis highlights Revenue's commitment to combat it.  The new legislative steps being taken, together with the work being done on the development of a more effective fuel marker, will serve to enhance the effectiveness of this action.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">With regard to alleviating the problems being experienced by the haulage industry, a working group was set up involving officials from the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and some Members of the Oireachtas.  This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry, and the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those ongoing discussions.  A fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road, with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes.  In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">My final point relates to the gain of €64 million.  The amount of money lost to the Exchequer as a result of fuel laundering is considerable, in excess of €250 million per year, and the Government is very conscious of that and the need to deal with it effectively.  The gain is in excess of €1 million per week due to the increase in VAT, not in excise.  The IMF restrictions and the fact that we are borrowing €41 million per day to run the economy show the scale of the challenge currently facing the Government.  Any income to the Exchequer at present is being spent in a very effective way on behalf of the taxpayer, but we are under immense pressure to secure tax take at present.  However, I accept the point made by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">The Government is being very decisive on the fuel laundering issue.  It is also conscious of the cost of doing business and the importance of lowering those costs.  Being from a business background, I am aware it is important to reduce costs for people in the delivery trade.  Hauliers are under huge pressure at present.  The job of the Government is to reduce the regulatory and other costs of doing business and the Minister for Finance is very conscious of that in all the actions he takes that impact on the creation of jobs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty</from>
            <p eId="para_664">I accept the assurances given this morning by the Tánaiste that it is his and the Labour Party's intention to retain the new water company that is due to be established in public ownership.  However, we must be conscious that after the new company is established, at some point in the future, God forbid, Fianna Fáil might be back in power or Fine Gael might be governing alone and the option of privatising it will still exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on the excellent work she is doing in the area of planning and housing.  She is driving a very positive and strong reform agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">Wherever water charges have been introduced they have been regressive.  That is evident from the statistics provided by the OECD.  In England, 3.7% of the incomes of the bottom 10% of the population goes on water charges, whereas for the top 10% it is only 0.4% of their income.  The same applies in France, Holland and Mexico.  In the 1990s, KPMG assessed the economic rationale for installing water meters and found it to be uneconomic.  It will cost approximately €800 million to install water meters.  I ask the Government to review that expenditure and consider using that €800 million to invest in water infrastructure.  That was done by Dublin City Council over the last few years and leakages have been reduced from 43% in the late 1990s to 28% now.  It would also create jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">We should shift the balance in our approach to taxation.  Unlike the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, I believe indirect taxation is the most unfair form of taxation.  It takes no account of people's incomes.  We must move to a progressive taxation system, which means introducing a higher rate of tax for those earning more than €100,000 per annum and introducing the wealth tax which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, told the House could bring in between €450 million and €500 million per year.  There must also be recognition that, unlike what some people suggest, the citizens of Ireland are very responsible.  They do not leave taps on left, right and centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">We should use the funds in the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in water infrastructure and, where necessary, progressively increase taxation on incomes to pay for services.  There must be a change of policy and direction, and that would be a progressive step.  We should not introduce water charges.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_276">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_669">This week saw the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, of the establishment of Irish Water.  This comes at a time when the working group of the Oireachtas committee on the environment and local government was in the process of concluding a report.  The fact that it was made before that committee concluded its report is most undemocratic and shows a total lack of respect for the institutions of the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The establishment of Irish Water will destroy local government and local democracy.  We are told it will be a subsidiary of Bord Gáis, a semi-State company.  It will not have any democratic accountability.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how we could achieve democratic accountability for this body either to this House or to local councillors.  The public will not have access to it; all people will have is an 1890 telephone number for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">I am flabbergasted at the cost of the metering.  A figure of €780 has been mentioned, or €39 per year over a period of 20 years.  That is very expensive metering.  Over 100 million holes will be dug in footpaths outside houses to fit meters that will not stop one drop of water from being leaked or conserved.  Usage in England, where there are meters, and usage in this country are the same; in fact, it is slightly higher in many parts of England.  It is far more effective to have district metering, which is already being used by county councils.  Is the Minister aware of that?  It is being used by councils such as those in Laois and Offaly to identify leaks in neighbourhoods and to manage the network.  It is a far more effective way of doing it.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Yesterday, the Taoiseach said water services would be cut off to households who are unable to pay or will not pay the charges.  This morning, the Tánaiste twice refused to distance himself from that comment when he was asked if he agreed with it.  He refused to clarify that he opposed it.  The conclusion one must draw is that people will have their water service cut off.  This is really serious.  Does the Minister not agree that the control and operation of these services would be better left with the local authorities?  If we are going to create jobs, let them be jobs that have the positive legacy of fixing leaks and saving the taxpayers money.  We must move to district metering, which is almost 100% complete in some local authority areas.  We should also put in place proper building regulations to harvest and conserve water through methods such as dual flushes.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_277">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_673">I thank Deputies for raising this issue and I am happy to respond on behalf of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The overarching objective of our water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements that will ensure we have a world class water and waste-water infrastructure that meets all environmental and public health standards, can attract foreign direct investment and support job creation and maintenance in key sectors such as pharma-chem, IT and food and drink.  Last December, on the basis of the recommendations of an independent assessment, the Government decided to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capacity delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  Further consideration has been given since then to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the semi-State sector could undertake the functions.  The outcome of this analysis is that Irish Water should be established as an independent, State-owned company within the Bord Gáis group.  Irish Water will be a public utility, wholly owned by the State.  I am anxious to reassure Deputy Nulty in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">Establishing a new water utility under the umbrella of a mature semi-State company makes best use of existing resources and capabilities.  This approach is also in line with Government plans to support economic growth by eliminating waste and duplication in public spending through rationalising State agencies.  Bord Gáis Éireann has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  The skills within the Bord Gáis group will be paired with experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and waste water capabilities that exist in local government to build the new organisation.  In the initial phase, Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities.  It is envisaged that these arrangements would end in 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">The Government has decided that when charges are introduced, they should be based on usage, reflect a free allowance and have specific measures for people with affordability issues.  This is the fairest and most equitable way to introduce charging.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">Meter infrastructure installation will commence by the end of the year and the programme will be rolled out on an accelerated basis.  This programme will create up to 2,000 jobs.  Households will not be asked to pay for these meters or their installation through an upfront charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The details of the funding model, including decisions relating to the precise charging framework, the level of charges, the free allowance and measures to address the needs of those with affordability issues or medical needs, have yet to be finalised.  These will be a matter for the regulator, who will be required to act in the best interests of the consumer and will engage in appropriate public consultation as the process develops, and for Government through the budgetary and Estimates process.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatrickNulty" eId="spk_278">
            <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty</from>
            <p eId="para_679">I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I will make two brief points.  With regard to charges and the alteration in people's water usage, the people whose behaviour will alter least are those on the highest incomes.  They will be able to afford the charge and, as economic actors, will be less sensitive to the introduction of a charge.  By its very nature, the charge will have a greater impact on middle and lower income households.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">Second, no member country of the OECD has introduced a water charge and done so in a progressive way.  This type of tax must hit people on middle and lower incomes hardest.  I encourage the Government to review its position before we go too far down this line.  There is €4.7 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Using that money strategically over three or four years to invest in water infrastructure, in a child care system or in rolling out broadband would generate economic activity and allow us to deal with long-term infrastructural projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">This initiative is being driven by Fine Gael.  In its general election manifesto, the Labour Party, which was my own party, made it clear that it was not in favour of water charges.  We need to make it clear to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that this is an unfair charge and to revise the position on it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_682">It is good to hear from Deputy Nulty that at least one member of the Labour Party remembers the commitments given before the election.  A huge amount of money will be spent without saving one drop of water.  That is the fact.  This very expensive process of putting meters outside every household will not stop the leaks in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The Minister of State said why Bord Gáis is a suitable holder of this contract and why it is the most appropriate company to be the parent company of the subsidiary that will look after this service.  In recent weeks, Sierra Support Services, a company owned by Mr. Denis O'Brien, secured a contract worth up to €60 million to become the sole provider for the installation, maintenance and testing of domestic boilers for Bord Gáis Energy.  Can the Minister of State confirm that no discussions took place between Mr. Denis O'Brien's company and the Taoiseach or any Minister during the Taoiseach's recent visit to New York or at any time regarding the installation and maintenance of water or gas meters or any of the fittings associated with them?</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_280" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_684">I disagree with both Deputies when they say this will not save water.  I absolutely disagree with their contention that charging, over a certain level of free water, will not concentrate people's minds on saving water.  People who are better off will not necessarily leave the taps on because they have a bit more money.  One could not say the better-off are not engaged in recycling and the use of bottle banks, for example.  Being responsible has nothing to do with being well off or not.  I reject that contention. If people are tight for money and if turning off the tap will save money, they will do so.  People I know who are tight for money will use whatever method they can to save money for themselves and their household.  I reject the contention that this measure will not save water.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">I can reassure Deputy Nulty that the Labour Party, and the Government in general, is committed to retaining this in public ownership.  I can counteract what Deputy Boyd Barrett said this morning.  There is not an EU liberalisation directive in this area.  There are many examples throughout Europe of water as a public utility, such as Scottish Water and Eau de Paris.  I reject the suggestion that this will lead to privatisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">Bord Gáis Éireann is an independent semi-State company.  The question raised by Deputy Stanley has nothing to do with what we are talking about today.  I do not know what Mr. Denis O'Brien or anyone else has to do with the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  There has been a consultation programme and there will now be a detailed implementation plan.  Any views expressed in the Dáil will be taken on board.  There will be a long lead-in period when the various issues and constructive suggestions will be considered.  I thank the Deputies and assure them that this is about providing good quality water, protecting consumers and ensuring we can create and maintain jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">1<b>Deputy Brendan Smith</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> if he will be seeking to ensure that all teachers’ allowances are protected under the review of allowances for public servants; his views on whether all such allowances are considered part of teachers pay under Croke Park; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn) (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_689">As the Deputy will be aware, the review of allowances in the public service which is ongoing at the moment is being conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I understand that the Minister intends to bring proposals to Government shortly.  The Government has reaffirmed the key commitments under the public service agreement, including that there will be no further reductions in pay rates for serving public servants.  These commitments are contingent on delivery of the required flexibilities and reforms to public service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">Allowances paid to teachers form only a part of the overall remit of the review.  It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to comment on any specific subset of allowances, pending the outcome of the review and its consideration by Government.  I have made and, of course, will make my views on these issues known in the appropriate fora.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_691">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I understood from his comments at the teachers' union conferences that he was conscious that allowances are part of the core pay of teachers.  It is my understanding that teachers' allowances are considered part of the core pay under the Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The Croke Park agreement has delivered benefits.  As Fianna Fáil was part of the Government that negotiated that agreement, I consider it important that it continues to work and bring further benefits in the delivery of services to the public and in better management of the public service.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to state clearly that the Croke Park agreement will not be reneged upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">It is often forgotten by the public, although not by the Minister, that there needs to be an incentive for people to engage in ongoing professional development.  There must be an incentive and a reward for that.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I confirm everything I said at the teachers' conferences.  It is clearly on the public record and I refer to it again here in the House.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  If an allowance is part of a payment and the allowance is reckonable for pensionable purposes, any reasonable person will conclude that it is part of one's pay and conditions.  These matters are still ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">On the second point, section 30 of the Teaching Council Act will soon be activated.  We are talking about education.  I presume that when certain legislation is finalised in the House, I will be able to bring it into operation.  One of the conditions for continued registration under section 30 of the Teaching Council Act will be demonstration to the satisfaction of the Teaching Council's own terms and conditions that continuing professional development is ongoing.  I support the Deputy in his observation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_696">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I represent rural constituencies and are conscious that in the early and mid-1990s a major effort was made to develop a network of education centres throughout the country.  That development was of great importance.  The teaching profession, to its credit, led the campaign to have the facilities put in place on a regional basis in order that there would be access to ongoing professional development courses.  Given the effort that has been and is being made with the profession in terms of upskilling and ongoing professional development with regard to technology, languages and science, it is important that the incentives and rewards are copperfastened and remain in place, as they have been recognised as part of core pay.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">I share the Deputy's view.  Modern technology has aided and supported continuing professional development through online course provision in many professions, but it must be seen as an additional resource to face to face contact and the interaction provided by teaching centres.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said because I recognise the necessity, as does the profession, for continuing professional development.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant, given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure.  This limits the capacity for any additionality in the DEIS programme.  In this context, I have no immediate plans to undertake the type of review to which the Deputy refers.  I would, however, mention that three reports were published earlier this year regarding the operation of the DEIS programme.  They included a report on the first phase of the evaluation of the DEIS programme by the Education Research Centre and two reports on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post-primary schools prepared by the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills.  I am pleased to say these evaluations demonstrated positive outcomes for both schools and individual children from the DEIS programme.  DEIS rural primary schools were not within the scope of the report on the net impact of budget 2012 on DEIS urban schools.  In any case, the overwhelming majority of DEIS rural primary schools were not affected by the budget 2012 proposals regarding legacy posts.  Of the 328 DEIS rural primary schools, only 16 will lose one legacy post each.</p>

It is not fair that many schools fit the criteria for the DEIS programme, but, unfortunately, because the scheme is not open to them, they are doubly penalised in respect of the changes introduced in the budget.  It is wrong and unfair and makes life difficult for the schools across the country that are affected.

Many of the schools outside the DEIS system fit all the criteria for the DEIS programme.  At the time I said it was about pulling down barriers, not putting them up.  Unfortunately, some schools are being kept outside the system.  We must examine such schools in the interests of fairness.  I accept the difficulty the Minister faces with resources.  If he had carried out a review, at least we would know the extent of the problem, which would be helpful in the debate in trying to resolve some of the issues.  Perhaps I misunderstood his intentions on DEIS rural schools, but the changes are affecting them.  The loss of teachers in disadvantaged schools will have a major impact.  Many people, including me, were under the impression that teachers in these schools would be safeguarded while the review was ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_707">The removal of legacy posts was intended to deal with cases in which there were two DEIS schools in a particular area or half a dozen DEIS schools in a particular area of disadvantage where it was possible to have two schools in the same socioeconomic grouping and locality, typically in the Deputy's constituency or the inner city part of my constituency, and one school would have more resources than the other simply because it had persuaded previous Ministers to leave intact the original relatively arbitrary measures introduced without a scientific analysis and basis and managed to hold on to the new resources coming to them.  For historical reasons - prior to the introduction of the DEIS programme which, from memory, was introduced in 2004 or thereabouts and on the basis of scientific criteria and a rational basis by the Department in both urban and rural areas - certain individual schools in areas of disadvantage, for whatever reasons – there were no standard criteria, as such - were included in different programmes at different times.  All that we ever targeted were the legacy or additional posts.  They are being reduced in some cases.  In others, because of the nature and scale of the schools involved, they are being left intact.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">One cannot fix a problem until one knows its extent.  The message I am getting from many schools is that the cuts are doubly unfair, given that they are outside the DEIS club.  I thought the matter of legacy posts had been resolved following the climbdown or review that was promised.  All of us in the House accept that the DEIS programme is working.  Why wreck a system when that is the case in order to remove legacy posts?  Schools are dealing with major problems of disadvantage.  The figures from the Department indicate that the DEIS programme is working in terms of the outcomes achieved whereby children move on to further education.  The literacy and numeracy strategy is a key component of the approach required.  The outcomes for DEIS schools are much more positive than they had been.  If the Minister takes away the resources, we will be pulling down the house that has been built.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I understand and share the Deputy's concerns about DEIS schools, but he is probably aware - as I am - that 60% of young people coming from disadvantaged homes are not being schooled in DEIS schools.  There is not a ghettoisation or concentration of disadvantage in DEIS schools, although it is self-evident that there are large concentrations of disadvantage in such schools.  However, that is not the full story and I must have regard to the entire picture.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">4<b>Deputy Brendan Smith</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> if all DEIS band 1 and DEIS band 2 schools will retain their legacy posts in September as promised this year; and the reason a number of schools have received letters in recent weeks which seem to indicate that they are either losing a legacy post or that post is being subsumed into the number of mainstream teacher posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_713">A total of 140 band 1 and band 2 schools will retain the number of legacy posts required by them to implement more favourable pupil-teacher ratios under previous disadvantage schemes for the 2012-13 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">A range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for schools, including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process for 2012-13 school year.  As the teacher allocation to schools is enrolment-based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year.  Changes in enrolment also contribute to the number of legacy posts allocated to DEIS schools from year to year.  Some DEIS schools seem to be under the impression that my decision of 21 February implied that they would retain their current number of legacy posts which is based on the 30 September 2010 enrolment.  What was decided was that certain schools would retain the favourable pupil-teacher ratios under legacy disadvantage schemes.  Therefore, the staffing allocation for the 2012-13 school year, including the allocation of legacy posts, is based on the enrolment on 30 September 2011.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_715">As Deputy Crowe stated, the DEIS programme has had a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage.  That is clear from an ESRI report, and also from the Educational Research Centre in St. Patrick's College, which showed that in the period 2007 to 2010, there were significantly higher scores for children under the DEIS programmes in reading and mathematics and that those extra supports in the classroom were particularly important.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The Minister, and maybe more so his parliamentary colleagues, gave a clear message to the schools affected that the Minister's review and that of the Department that he announced in February would reverse the decisions to remove the DEIS supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">I have had quite a number of schools in touch with me which have received letters from the Department and they are extremely concerned about the news conveyed.  According to St. Francis junior national school in Priorswood, there was no mention of legacy posts in a letter from the Department regarding the staffing schedule.  Our Lady Immaculate senior school Darndale currently has nine mainstream plus two legacy posts and it has been allocated its staffing schedule for 2013, which is one of ten mainstream teachers plus one legacy post, but its enrolment has increased.  We can understand that if enrolment has fallen, it has a bearing on the overall teaching and support staff, but that is not the position in that school.  That school is also losing a learning support teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">One other school that we all have seen on television, and the teachers of which we have heard speak in broadcast media, is St. Laurence O'Toole junior boys' school in North Wall in Dublin.  It has one principal and eight assistant teachers, but from September it will have only five assistant teachers.  They clearly understood from some of the Minister's parliamentary colleagues and some of his party's public representatives that they would be retaining their staffing complement.  The news from the Department has come as a great shock, surprise and disappointment to those schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">In some cases, there may have been adjustments to the overall teaching allocation as a result of the change in the general allocation model, GAM.

            <p eId="para_725">I suspect from what Deputy Smith said that he is referring to the original allocation correspondence and, assuming those schools have appealed, the outcome of what they are now getting may be slightly different when they finally get the correspondence next week.

I am led to understand from the main schools in Wexford concerned, Scoil Mhuire and St. Senan's, that the appeal system seems to have been taken away from them.

A number of parents rung me to say that, with the cuts that have been implemented to date, some children are unable to participate in mainstream classes because there are not enough SNAs to go around.  They would argue that they are not being treated as equal to their peers and they are not being given quite the same chance to reach their potential in life.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">I would also mention the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  The parents argue that it would allow them to appeal to the National Council for Special Education.  What is more, each child, under the EPSEN Act 2004, would have an individual education plan.  Would the Minister outline the progress the Department has made to date on the commitment in the programme for Government to publish an updated implementation plan for the 2004 EPSEN Act?</p>

            <p eId="para_739">In September 2011 the NCSE allocated 10,100 posts to schools while retaining 475 posts to cover late and emergency applications.

That was a very good, much needed and welcome investment to assist many children.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">The Deputy is basically correct.  We have the employment control framework figure of 10,575 and this was communicated to the NCSE.  Last year, its SENOs communicated to all the schools that 10% was being retained in order to deal with late applications and emergency cases.  Unfortunately, the communication was not properly or clearly understood and, in some cases, understandably - I am not blaming anyone as we are all human - this was communicated as a 10% reduction in that total number.  That was not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The operation of the NCSE is separate from the Department of Education and Skills.  The assessment of special needs, as the Deputy knows, is a function of the SENOs and the allocation of resources and the prudent retention of a reserve to deal with late applications or emergency cases is a judgment of the NCSE.  What I will be asking the NCSE in light of the Deputy's very rational question is whether it is being over-careful in holding back 10% or being over-careful in the way in which they are assessing late applications.  There is no gain from our point of view within the Department of not filling the full allocation of SNAs within the framework of employment control.</p>

            <p eId="para_756">A number of education related actions in the 20-year strategy are already underway, especially in regard to teacher education, reform of the curriculum at primary and post-primary level and the provision of teaching resources.  The strategy recognises the importance of equipping teachers to teach through the medium of Irish.  As part of the national literacy and numeracy strategy, I have asked the Teaching Council to consider the requirements in Irish for entry to teacher education courses and to be cognisant of the 20-year strategy in addressing the preparation of teachers to teach Irish at all stages of the continuum.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">I have also asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to revise the content of the primary curriculum and junior cycle for Irish.  In addition, the NCCA has undertaken to review the syllabus for leaving certificate in light of the experience of the students completing the revised leaving certificate course in June 2012.  The Department is also providing some €1.75 million to An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta in 2012 for the provision of resources to support the teaching of Irish in all schools.  All of these actions will help to support Irish-medium education both within and outside the Gaeltacht.</p>

            <p eId="para_758">The Department of Education and Skills is central to the implementation of the 20-year strategy.  The Minister refers in his reply to teachers who are proficient in the language having an essential role in regard to the creation of the new generation of Irish language speakers in the future.  Why, then, has the funding for trainee teachers to attend Irish language classes in Gaeltacht areas been cut?</p>
            <p eId="para_759">How often does the strategy committee meet in this regard?  An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG, has not been included in the top-level committee.  Is it an essential part of the implementation strategy?  The establishment of an Irish language training college was one of the proposals.  Is there any movement in that regard?  Has the Minister plans to address the serious Irish language deficiencies in his own Department?  Training used to be provided in Gaeleagras but only approximately 3% of the Department staff are proficient in the Irish language.  Are there proposals in the Department to up-skill members of staff as part of the essential pushing out of the strategy?</p>

            <p eId="para_760">I have taken note of Deputy Crowe's supplementary questions.  Some of the queries raised are not fully covered in the documents before me.  I will write to the Deputy about these.  Since we had to find savings somewhere we reduced the financial support for teachers taking support courses in the Gaeltacht.  The arrangement now is that they make the contribution for the courses.  I am speaking from memory and this is subject to confirmation.  I will get a letter to Deputy Crowe outlining the details of the other questions.  It will be on the official record.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">Up to now, Gaeltacht schools had a preferential pupil-teacher ratio in recognition of the challenges of teaching through the medium of Irish.  There was also a recognition of the lack of teaching resources available and the decline of the language.  This is why the strategy was set up.  We have cut back the preferential pupil-teacher ratios.  On the one hand we are pushing forward a strategy but on the other hand we appear to be pulling the rug from under it.  The Minister's Department is taking the lead with the strategy and this is one of the concerns of the language activists.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">I understand the Deputy's concerns.  However, within reason all sections of the education budget had to take some portion of the overall burden of budget adjustment.  There was a favourable pupil-teacher ratio for gaelscoileanna compared with other schools.  I have removed that favourable ratio.  As Deputy Crowe is aware, this has in no way indicated a decline in the demand for participation in gaelscoileanna.  As part of the allocation of patronage for new schools, gaelscoileanna and gaelcoláistí have been well looked after.  There is a clear indication of trying to meet the demand within existing resources while, at the same time, making overall savings.</p>

            <p eId="para_765">I welcome the timescale of the process outlined by the Minister.  Are heads of a Bill required to bring forward legislation to implement the process?  There is a precedent.  The University of Limerick was established in 1972 as the National Institute of Higher Education.  Is it possible this precedent could be used in future?  It is important that the matter is not kept off the agenda for an indefinite period.  The south east is probably the largest area of the country with no university in the area and it has a population of approximately 500,000.  I support the views of my colleagues in Waterford, including Deputy Coffey, who are keen to progress the idea in the south-east area, given the high unemployment situation there at the moment.  We need an impetus such as a technological university to address this.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_766">As part of the process, the Higher Education Authority has written to all the institutions, including the institutes of technology and other third level colleges.  The authority has given the institutions six months to respond to the recommendations of what is known as the Hunt report, the review of higher education that my predecessor and the Administration of which Deputy Smith was a member published in January 2011.  They were given six months to indicate what they intended to do and where they envisaged their future, including whether the various institutes of technology wished to link with another institute of technology to pursue the prospect of becoming a technological university.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">Ireland has seven universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is assumed to be similar to a university although it does not have the categorisation or title of a university.  The report recommended that we do not need any more universities given the population of 4.6 million in the State.  However, there is merit in the concept of a technological university.  The criteria required by an institution to reach the status of a technological university were published in the formal reply in February.  It will be up to individual institutions to decide whether they want to have a crack at going for it.  They will indicate whether they wish to do so within the six month period.  The responses will be evaluated in the course of another six months.  Therefore, 12 months from having received the letter, they will either get the go-ahead to go to the next stage or otherwise.  If we get an indication from an institution that it wishes to proceed and the proposal is credible, then the necessary legislative frameworks will be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">However, I emphasise that the decision to confer technological university status on any group or cluster of technological colleges will not be made in the House and it will not be decided politically.  It will be decided by an international review panel that will review the application by any group or groupings.  It will examine the criteria we set out in advance.  These are available if anyone wishes to examine them.  A decision will be made by the international advisory group established on objective criteria and the group will advise the Minister of the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">I wish to explain the political thinking behind this.  In Britain, Maggie Thatcher re-labelled every polytechnic as a university.  One can come across the University of East Lancashire and so on.  In the process, this devalued university status among the mainstream universities in the United Kingdom.  The universities of Oxford and Cambridge will always be "Oxford" and "Cambridge" and the University of London and the London School of Economics will have their status, just as Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin have a certain status here.  However, the other universities will be devalued by a political decision, as happened in Britain.  I have no intention of going down that road.  Institutions should be granted the status on merit.  I hope Members share that view.  The process has been laid out.  The expectation is that the south-east colleges will come together.  I am aware informally that this is their intention.  However, a process must be adhered to and I have laid it out.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I agree with the approach of the Minister.  We have discussed previously in the House the utmost importance of safeguarding academic standards.  That goes without saying.  It is important that the HEA brings in an internationally renowned panel of experts.  I know from speaking to members of my political party in the south east and other interested parties that the people in the south east are passionate with regard to bringing an additional resource to their area.  I fully understand this view.  The Minister will recall that previously Deputy Seamus Kirk commented on the position in the north east.  Are potential constituent colleges from outside the jurisdiction eligible to apply as part of a clustering arrangement with colleges and third level institutes in our State?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_771">I am unsure of the precise technical answer to that question but let me offer an opinion.  I have established a good working relationship with my counterpart in Northern Ireland who now has total responsibility for higher level education.  This was previously the remit of another Minister in the Executive there.  He has the same range as I have now.  We are considering cross-Border collaboration in several ways.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">I imagine a university recognised by two separate, legal jurisdictions would require the co-operation and agreement of both.  I am not averse to it.  There are seven universities here as well as the Dublin Institute of Technology and there are two universities in Northern Ireland.  The report calls for collaboration and I support this call.  When I met the presidents and chairpersons of the 14 institutes of technology I indicated they should consider an all-Ireland collaborative approach to third level provision in future.  If that collaboration moves in the direction of a technological university then I do not envisage the Border as a barrier.  However, any institution would have to meet the academic criteria and the standards set out.  If this means collaboration between Belfast and Dublin to achieve it, I am open to that.  I am offering this to the Deputy as an opinion; it has not, as yet, come about.  If the Higher Education Authority were to decide after six months that such a joint approach is a credible one and should be facilitated, then we would have to take the steps - between Belfast and Dublin and possibly London, although that is unlikely - to allow it to happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">I concur with Deputy Smith in regard to the importance of maintaining academic standards.  We will never sort out our unemployment situation, whether in the south east or anywhere else, merely by changing the name over the door of a university.  We must strive to improve standards into the future in order to achieve our objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">Coming from south Ulster I am anxious that we drive forward the North-South agenda to a greater degree.  Significant numbers of students from Cavan and Monaghan go to colleges in the North, with students from the Six Counties moving in the other direction as well.  There is potential to drive that type of cross-Border facilitation forward.  Dundalk Institute of Technology has made a huge effort to provide access to young people from disadvantaged homes and less well-off backgrounds, with the percentage of students coming from families in which they are the first to proceed to third level being particularly high.  It would be extremely bad for our education system if Dundalk Institute of Technology were to be left out on a limb and unable to maximise its potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_777">I have embarked on a survey in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Mr. John O'Dowd, of parents of children at both primary and post-primary level living along a corridor 30 km wide from Derry to Newry with a view to determining the degree of demand for sending children across the Border to school for whatever reason, whether ethos, convenience, catchment area or place of employment.  If there is sufficient expression of interest, the objective is that, effective from September 2013, people living, for example, in the Finn Valley can opt to send their children across the Finn river to Cavan or Monaghan, and <i>vice versa</i>.  The configuration of the Border tends to follow natural geographical features such as rivers, which does not necessarily correlate with the catchment area of the population.  We would then do a reconciliation on a <i>per capita</i> basis between pupils on either side.</p>

I cannot enforce a voluntary waiver.  Nor can I insist that a waiver, if made, follows any particular format.

The period in which our colleges and their top-class facilities are not in use each year is something of a farce.  We are all conscious of the huge investment that took place in universities and institutes of technologies in the past decade or so.  Those facilities should be in use for at least 90% of the year rather than 60% or 70%.

The types of economies to which Deputy Smith referred are self-evident common sense.  No commercial enterprise could afford to allow expensive plant and equipment to lie idle for long periods.  Nor is this an issue only in the university sector.  We have even less knowledge of what is happening in the institutes of technology.  Part and parcel of the exercise to which I referred earlier will be a wide-ranging letter from the Higher Education Authority seeking to identify what each institution does, what it intends to do in the next decade and how it will meet those objectives.  I intend to engage fully in that process while being careful at the same time not to stifle innovation, creativity and independence of operation.

My Department is also projecting that enrolments at second level will then start to reduce back closer to current levels.  If the current 19:1 staffing ratio is unchanged, this will indeed generate a requirement for an additional 3,000 teachers by the year 2025.  The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the education sector.

If those structures are in place, the most important question will be whether sufficient teachers will be available.  The teachers' unions have suggested approximately 280 teachers per annum will be required, while they also have expressed concern about the number of teachers leaving the system.  The major concern underlying this point pertains to the difference in salary scale for new teachers entering the profession and whether anything can be done in the future about the unfairness of a really low income being set for many such new teachers.  Moreover, many of them are not young students emerging from college.  Many have mortgages, children and everything else but have a love of the idea of teaching and so on.  Such individuals must be supported and the best people encouraged to enter the profession.  Does the Minister agree that it is about putting in place the resources required in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_792">I share Deputy Brendan Smith's sentiments and assure him that there is serious long-term planning within the Department.  It has been reinforced since my arrival at its Marlborough Street headquarters.  The Department has put in place a new design and build procurement process and mobilised additional resources from across the public sector.  For example, the Office of Public Works has spare capacity because there is not a great deal of building activity.  Moreover, personnel from the former National Building Agency have been made available to the Department to assist its Tullamore unit in direct procurement.  In addition, I believe the Deputy mentioned the chief executive officer of County Louth Vocational Education Committee in an earlier question.  The Department has mobilised the resources and executive capability in VECs to act as its agents to manage, procure and deliver building projects.  For example, a substantial project of which the Deputy will be aware is under way in Monaghan town.  This is a model for what might be done elsewhere to ensure the product is delivered on time and in the places in which it is needed.  Moreover, the Department has a geographic information system, GIS, with which Deputy Crowe is familiar that makes predictions.  It knows the location of every one-year old child whose parent is in receipt of a child benefit payment.  With regard to the primary and, to a lesser extent, the secondary sectors, predictions can be made about population demand.  The Department has the tools and recognition capacity to engage in forward planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">As for the reform of the junior certificate, it is envisaged this programme will start with next September's intake of first-year students entering post-primary schools.  However, it will not reach completion, in terms of the junior certificate or whatever name is given to the new examination, until 2020.  It will cover an eight-year spectrum to start a programme of curricular reform, roll it out over time, on the assumption that the Department's timetable is reasonable, and then see youngsters going through the three-year cycle and sitting their examinations.  Consequently, we must start planning now to achieve an effective change, but we also must recognise that of itself, implementation requires time to reach fulfilment.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">Another element of such long-term planning is that joined-up government will be required in the procurement of schools.  I refer to the old structure of setting aside land for a school that was subsequently never built; this happened nationwide.  If the construction industry ever takes off again, it must be linked to such planning developments and joined-up government on the part of the Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This is the way forward and given the anticipated numbers of pupils, it is the only way in which it will be delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_795">This is not a reflection on Deputy Brendan Smith in any way because he probably shared my view, but at the height of the boom, the previous Administration could have induced developers to set aside school sites free of charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_797">Yes.  Given the acreage required, some school sites come with a price tag of approximately €3 million.  At the time developers would have happily agreed to set aside the sites, as the cost would have been spread across the development cost of the entire project.  However, this simply was not done.</p>

            <p eId="para_799">The new dedicated staffing schedule, when applied to the school referred to by the Deputy, ensures this school operates its entitlement under the DEIS programme to a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1.  In addition, the school will retain the more favourable pupil-teacher ratios under previous disadvantage schemes for the 2012-13 school year.  Owing to a falling enrolment, the school is due to lose one mainstream classroom teacher and one administrative principal post.  I wish to clarify it would lose these posts, regardless of any reforms to the teacher allocation process or budgetary measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">The allocation processes also include an appeals mechanism, under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The school to which the Deputy refers has submitted an appeal.  The staffing appeals board which operates independently of my Department met on 18 April and will notify schools directly.  The final staffing position for all schools at primary level ultimately will not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the staffing appeals board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_807">Under budget 2012, teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date.  Allowances for teachers first appointed between 5 December 2011 and 31 January 2012 are payable up to a maximum of €4,226, which was the rate applicable to the honours primary degree allowance.  This measure is concerned with the sustainability of the public service pay bill and, in particular, the need to find payroll savings in the education Vote.  In setting the new maximum at the rate applicable to the honours primary degree allowance, cognisance was taken of the level of qualification required by the Teaching Council.  The previous arrangements whereby a teacher could elect to acquire further qualifications post-entry to the profession and secure a pensionable pay increase simply were not sustainable and as such, I do not accept the measure has any significant implication for the development of a knowledge-based economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">Is the precise number known?  Figures available to me indicate that almost half of the 9,000 postgraduate students in the State have their fees paid or receive a minimum maintenance grant.  I have received information that cuts to postgraduate courses will prevent some of the country's brightest and most capable young people from accessing higher education.  This does not simply pertain to teachers because for some masters degree courses fees of approximately €6,000 are charged.  Again, those who are from low or middle income family backgrounds are the students who will have difficulty in moving on in their education.  One is told continually that fully-qualified people are needed to take up the opportunities afforded by the new knowledge economy and so on.  While, on the one hand, one is told there is a crisis in this regard, on the other, supports are not being given to people to enable them to move on in their education.  Some of the people who attended today's meeting of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to discuss the same matter also made the worrying point that while the State is saying one thing, it is doing another.  While such education costs a lot of money, rather than bringing in people from abroad to fill the skills void and take up many of the available jobs, it would be cheaper in the long run.</p>

            <p eId="para_809">The Government was obliged to make decisions across the budgetary framework for reasons that are all too evident to everyone present in the Chamber.  Ireland is highly fortunate in that, unlike our nearest neighbours and other European Union countries, gaining entry to any of its five primary school teacher colleges necessitates being in the top 15% of the leaving certificate honours and points outcomes.  As an incredibly high level of achievement is required, very bright people are entering the colleges and as the phenomenon dates back over many decades, I do not suggest for one moment this is due to this Administration or its predecessor.  Teaching is well regarded in Ireland, which is a major advantage.  This is not the case in other countries because they are not as well paid, not as well regarded and do not have what one might call the same professional or social status.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act will be activated later this year on the enactment of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2012 which is going through the House.  This will enable the Teaching Council to ensure that only teachers who are registered with it will be paid a State salary.  Such teachers will be obliged to re-register each year and will have to provide proof of continual professional development.  This will ensure that the cohort of teachers already in place will be upskilled.  To a certain extent, this particular provision will no longer be necessary.  However, we will be considering how to ensure that graduates who obtain jobs in primary schools will pursue other postgraduate qualifications.  Continuing professional development is a requirement among all the professions, including those which relate to doctors and other medical personnel, lawyers, architects, etc.  Teachers are going to be obliged to pursue such development as well.</p>

There have already been reports from certain colleges with regard to courses being dropped, etc.  Perhaps we could return to this matter early next year and the Minister could make a statement in the House in respect of the effect of what is proposed.  If that effect is negative in nature, will we be in a position to re-examine what is involved?  We have been given mixed messages regarding the knowledge-based economy.  It is those who cannot afford to pay - those on the lowest incomes, etc. - who are going to suffer most in respect of this matter.</p>

All Members would have received correspondence from and met people of different ages who expect to qualify as teachers shortly.  As a result of changing careers, etc., many of these individuals already have substantial mortgage commitments and student loans and they are very concerned with regard to the rate of pay that will apply at the entry level to teaching.  This issue requires further consideration in order that we might ensure that we continue to protect the teaching profession.  We must also ensure that the entry requirements relating to training colleges and universities are of the highest standard.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">A typical provincial town with a catchment area in which 30,000 to 40,000 people reside may, for historical reasons, have up to seven or eight primary schools and three or four post-primary schools, including a former VEC technical school and a school created from the amalgamation of two schools run by the Christian Brothers and an order of nuns, respectively, possibly a college of further education and, in some cases, an institute of technology.  Institutes of technology are certainly to be found in 14 such towns.  We do not know, on a horizontal basis, what exactly we possess.  We do not know if the science laboratory in one secondary school is up to scratch or if that in another is decrepit.  Each school is an island and they apply individually for support and resources of one kind or another.  What I want to do is obtain an inventory of the educational resources in various towns and identify what we can use to ensure maximum efficiency.  If there is a good sports hall in one school or if a GAA club has recently received a grant to build such a hall, I want to know if these facilities can be thrown into the mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">For many reasons, schools have historically dealt directly with the Department.  As a result of the fact that the same curriculum is being taught at primary and secondary level and because there is no longer the same kind of institutional or social rivalry among different teaching orders, we now have an opportunity to ensure we obtain proper value from and utilise the physical resource that exists.  However, we must first measure the extent of that resource.  That is what the inventory is doing but it is not confined to a particular type of town or to new or expanding areas.  In some instances there is probably greater capacity for better utilisation in what might be termed a "stable" town.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">The stability treaty is simple in nature.  This is not a complex issue because the treaty relates to a very simple matter.  The treaty is designed to protect the citizens of this State from reckless spending on the part of future generations.  Essentially, it will also ensure sound budgetary principles.  The treaty will protect the current and future generations - the current children of this State and the future grandchildren of many people who live here - from Governments engaging in the type of reckless spending policies pursued from 2002 onwards by Fianna Fáil-led Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Despite how it is being termed by some on the opposite side of the House, this is not an austerity treaty.  It is, rather, a treaty which is designed to ensure an ultimate end to austerity and to protect the current and future generations from a repetition of the bad politics of the past.  Much of that type of bad politics has coloured many of the contributions that have been made by those who are opposed to the treaty and who are calling for a "No" vote.  The bad politics now being peddled by Sinn Féin and various Independent Deputies posits that the State is some form of bottomless ATM which provides money to the Government and that this can be spent without anyone taking responsibility of any kind for raising other funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">This State is on the road to recovery.  There are difficult times ahead and tens of thousands of families continue to experience problems.  The treaty is a piece of the jigsaw which must be completed to ensure we continue on the road to recovery.  It will also ensure the multinational companies operating in the State and those outside it which are considering the possibility of establishing operations and creating jobs here will have confidence in the budgetary policies that will be implemented by future Governments and also in the stability of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">There are far too many Members of this House - in Sinn Féin and the smaller parties and on the Independent benches - who continually call for additional expenditure in respect of everything without recognising the need to raise money to achieve this.  Deputy McDonald stated the Government is inviting citizens to set in stone a binding international agreement that will place serious restrictions on our capacity to borrow.  Despite the reckless spending of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government and the appalling legacy inherited by the current Administration, the Deputy apparently believes there should be no constitutional or legal barriers of any nature erected to prevent a future Government replicating the disastrous policies of the past.  There is a terrible dishonesty at the heart of the Sinn Féin approach to this issue.  In her speech, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald stated "It is important to say that those of us who have been critical of EU institutions, policies and treaties are not, therefore, anti-European."  The reality is that Sinn Féin has been obsessively opposed to every EU related treaty since referendums have been held on the issue, and the position taken by Sinn Féin is no different today than in the past.  The Sinn Féin Party, as well as Deputies Higgins, Boyd Barrett and Mattie McGrath, are followers and leading proponents of the "money grows on trees" school of politics.  It is the bad politics of the past which these people continue to articulate in the present, and which no Government should be permitted to engage with in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">It is in the national interest that we effect debt reduction, bringing budget deficits under controlled limits.  It is in the interest of the people of this State and future generations that people should vote "Yes" on this treaty.  Deputy Higgins has criticised the fact that EU member states which do not ratify the stability treaty will not be able to access the European Stability Mechanism, arguing that this is "outrageous blackmail".  It seems that he and others believe this State has a continuing right to receive funds without being obliged to take action to deal with fiscal difficulties.  There is a belief on the part of Deputy Higgins and others that we are entitled to live beyond our means and continue to receive financial hand-outs from the rest of Europe.  There is a total lack of reality in this approach, and it is grossly dishonest to deceive voters in this way.  Is it not reasonable for citizens of other EU states to ask if we need additional funding, why we should receive it in the absence of bringing debt under control and supporting the essential legal architecture being put in place to ensure we do not get into similar difficulties in future?</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Deputy Ó Cuív has said that although he is opposing the treaty, he is in favour of fiscal discipline, again replicating the bad politics which he and his colleagues engaged with in government.  It is a great pity that at that time the Deputy did not express some enthusiasm for fiscal discipline.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">There are two specific and positive reasons for a "Yes" vote, and I have already emphasised the first.  It is to ensure no reckless spending by any future Government to the detriment of our people.  In the background we have an insurance policy of being able to obtain assistance through the ESM should we need to seek it in future.  It is my hope and belief - shared by the Government - that we will not require additional financial assistance through the ESM but it would be extraordinarily unwise to exclude the possibility of such assistance being available in the context of the choppy fiscal and economic waters through which our State is travelling and which currently prevail across a number of countries in the European Union.  We must ensure the stability of the euro and our continuance on the path to recovery.  We must see that those who use Ireland as access to Europe will continue to do so, expand their presence and continue to create jobs and attract new companies to Ireland.  It is important we vote "Yes" and support the treaty, and I urge people to do so.  I urge those calling for a "No" vote to explain to the people where they anticipate funding will come from in the absence in future years of this State having sensible fiscal policies and balanced budgets, which can lead us to paying for the expenditure we incur as a State.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on Second Stage of this Bill to provide for a referendum on the European fiscal stability compact.  If we needed a wake-up call for the Government and those of us who support the passage of the treaty, we got it with the opinion poll published by <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.  That indicated clearly that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance and it could go either way.  The advantage is with the “Yes” side currently but that could change, depending on the type of campaign conducted by the “Yes” side, in particular, over the six weeks to polling day.  Time is short and every day from now on must be used constructively by those of us advocating a “Yes” vote in the referendum to the people.  As the leader of the “Yes” campaign, there is a particular onus on the Government to run a vigorous and vibrant effort over the next six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The most fascinating figure from today's poll is the statistic that almost four people from ten, or 39% of people, have not yet made up their mind, and such people may be convinced to vote either way.  The "Yes" side currently leads that poll with 30% to the 23% of the "No" side, with 39% of people saying they do not yet know how they will vote.  There is still an information deficit and although the treaty is relatively straightforward and accessible, the majority of people do not know what is involved.  There is a great onus on the Government to ensure the necessary information is put out there in a clear, simple and understandable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">There were other interesting statistics concerning other issues in the poll.  Some 66% of people believe Ireland is better as part of the EU, as opposed to 22% of people who disagree with our participation.  There are three times as many people who believe Ireland should be part of the EU as people who do not share that view.  This treaty is not about Ireland remaining in the European Union but we have been given an indication that people are favourably disposed to Europe and Ireland's ongoing involvement in all affairs at the European Union level.  Further poll findings indicate that 59% of people are dissatisfied with the manner in which European leaders are running the EU, which means there are a number of conflicting forces in play.  People are positively disposed to Europe and Ireland's engagement with the Union but people are not impressed with what they have seen at a European level, including the management of this crisis since 2008 and the series of crisis summits and meetings last year.  They seemed to be endless, and night after night people looked at the news to see leaders going to Brussels for more crisis and emergency meetings.  Nevertheless, the problem rumbled on and people lost faith in the institutions of the European Union and the political leadership because of a failure to grasp the seriousness of the crisis and to react in a decisive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Additionally, the poll indicated that people do not believe the Irish Government's contention that we will not need a second bailout, as 58% of people stated that Ireland will need a second programme of assistance.  In a way, that may work in the Government's favour as if people think that way, they will recognise the importance of having the backstop of the ESM fund available to Ireland.  It is unquestionably one of the selling points for the "Yes" side and those looking to pass the treaty.  Nevertheless, the starting point for the Government and those of us who believe in this treaty should be to accept that it will be a difficult sell.  The Irish people are in a very hard place today and are really struggling.  They are disillusioned with politics and many have lost faith with the current Government already because of the abandonment of many election promises, the handling of the household charge and the water charge debacle over recent weeks.  They are now reading speculation about the roll-out of the property tax from 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">It is against such a backdrop that we must convince people that this is the correct course for Ireland and this treaty is worthy of support.  It will be a difficult task but it can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">It all comes down to the campaign run.  As with every election any of us has contested during the years, if one does not engage in a robust and vigorous campaign, meet people and explain where one is coming from, one will not be successful.  The Government has an opportunity to make the referendum campaign its single priority for the six weeks before polling day.  It must meet people as soon as possible to explain the benefits of the treaty and repeat what was done during the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty when civil society groups were invited to actively engage and support the campaign.  I take my hat off to the Irish Farmers' Association which has already sent members an information leaflet summarising the treaty in simple and understandable terms.  If we can persuade other groups to do likewise, the treaty stands a good chance of being successful.  Given that many people are more inclined to listen to civic leaders than they are to political leaders, it is particularly important that we secure the support of civic society.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The European Union has received a great deal of bad publicity recently and, in Ireland's case, some of it has been justified.  While this debate is not an appropriate one in which to dwell on the issue, people are especially annoyed about the intransigence shown by the European Central Bank on the issue of sharing the burden of bank related debt.  Even in recent weeks, members of the board of the ECB have issued hardline statements on the promissory note arrangement.  We have bought some time, perhaps a year, which gives us a window of opportunity to secure an overall deal.  People are annoyed when they see the obvious unfairness in the manner in which Ireland has been treated on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Fianna Fáil Party is genuinely committed to the treaty and I encourage the Government to involve us in the campaign in so far as possible.  We will actively campaign in the referendum.  Opinion polls have consistently shown that those who support Fianna Fáil are strongly pro-European, as was confirmed in an opinion poll published today.  My party will play its part in ensuring there is a strong campaign on the "Yes" side.  While we recognise that the Government has a leadership role in the referendum, we do not want to be sidelined.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">We want our voice heard and an opportunity to advocate the reasons we want our supporters and the wider population to vote in favour of the treaty.  My party also recognises the shortfalls in the treaty.  I note from the Tánaiste's contribution that the Government also recognises the treaty does not provide a panacea for all of the European Union's ills.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The fact that the fiscal compact is not a full EU treaty makes it a tricky issue.  It also means unanimity among member states is not required.  As a result, only 12 eurozone countries need to ratify the treaty for it to proceed.  The fiscal rules in the treaty are, by and large, enshrined in various regulations and codes to which we have already signed up.  It would be highly disingenuous, inaccurate and dishonest of those who oppose the treaty to suggest that if the people vote against the treaty, the country will not be required to balance its books over time or that we will find an easier or less painful way of achieving the fiscal correction we all agree is necessary.  Do we really believe that in the event of Ireland failing to endorse the treaty the international markets will demand a smaller price from us than our European partners and the IMF which are funding us under the programme?  That is manifestly not the case.  On the contrary, it is inevitable that if Ireland rejects the treaty, the costs of borrowing will dramatically increase by virtue of the fact that we will no longer have access to the backstop of the European Stability Mechanism.  Without this backstop being available, the insurance policy, as the Taoiseach described it, and the costs of borrowing will inevitably increase.  That is a risk we cannot afford to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The requirement to reduce the structural deficit to 0.5% or less is onerous.  We need absolute clarity on the definition of the term "structural deficit".  Furthermore, each member state must have an input into the determination of the timeframe within which it must achieve the 0.5% target.  Having engaged with the Taoiseach on this issue, my party has been assured the Government will have a significant input into any such determination for Ireland.  This is very much to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">People must consider who is lining up on the "Yes" and "No" sides of the referendum debate.  The opponents of the treaty have opposed every European treaty placed before the people.  While Fianna Fáil is critical of the Government on many issues, we recognise that the opponents of the current treaty would have opposed any deal the Government had secured in Brussels, irrespective of its contents.  They opposed membership of the European Economic Community and on every single occasion a question concerning our engagement with the European Union has been put to the electorate, they have opposed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The Fianna Fáil Party has been critical of the Government's decision to sign up to a measure that will remove the insurance policy of access to the ESM from countries which do not endorse the treaty.  This outcome marked a failure of the negotiating strategy of the Government.  The fiscal stability treaty, as constructed and with all of its conditionality, stands nonetheless.  It has been signed by the Government and awaits the approval or rejection of citizens in its current form.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">One intriguing aspect of the debate is the backdrop of the French presidential election campaign.  It is noteworthy that François Hollande, the socialist candidate, and Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent, are calling for the role and mandate of the European Central Bank to be broadened from its current narrow definition focused on price stability to include growth.  As the Tánaiste is aware, my party has been advocating this position for some time and welcomes that it has moved centre stage in the French presidential election.  I hope this will result in changes to the mandate of the ECB because we will only be able to reduce our debt to GDP ratio to 60% over time through economic growth.  We will not be able to cut our way to the 60% target without growing the economy.  I hope that message will be listened to throughout Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">I am somewhat concerned by reports that the socialist candidate in the French presidential election hopes to reopen the debate on the fiscal stability treaty if he is elected.  He should clarify precisely what he means in this regard.  Some of the speculation suggests this may result in a protocol being attached to the treaty.  It is unfair on the Irish people to vote on the treaty when the candidate most likely to become the next French President is indicating he wishes to reopen the debate on it.  This is regrettable as it introduces an element of uncertainty.  I hope that in the course of the next six weeks the muddied waters will clear and people will learn exactly what M. Hollande is seeking and precisely what they are voting on.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">I urge the Government not to rest on its laurels.  With the referendum hanging in the balance, a full and vigorous campaign will be required on the "Yes" side to ensure its passage.  We, in Fianna Fáil, will play our part.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_853">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for sharing time.  I will be brief as my party colleagues have articulated the Fianna Fáil Party position of support in this important referendum.  It is good that the Government has conceded that holding a referendum is necessary, giving the people an opportunity to have their say on what will be an important amendment to the Constitution.  It is important that the referendum is taking place at the end of May.  The opinion poll findings published today show four in ten people are unsure of what way they will vote, which means that the treaty is on a tight wire.  It behoves all of us in the political parties which support the treaty to get out and sell the message in a very clear manner and layman's terms in order that the general public will understand exactly what it is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The Tánaiste and Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade is present in the Chamber.  I ask him to encourage his colleagues in the Cabinet and on the back benches to refrain from adopting a partisan approach to the treaty, as it is important that we all support it.  It is important that my party is brought on board in support of the treaty.  We  have already heard partisan comments during the debate, which I do not think are helpful.  We need to unite to sell the message to the public about the benefits to be gained in passing the treaty.  It is not a foregone conclusion that it will be passed.  We have had experiences in the not too distant past when arrogance took hold and previous referendums failed.   I, therefore, encourage certain Ministers to refrain from adopting such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">While the treaty will ensure we will have protection in the future, that we will have prudent governance and that we will not end up again in a situation where there is such a high debt to GDP ratio, if it had been in place prior to the crisis, would we be in a different position now?  We might be marginally better offer, but we would not be a whole lot better off.  Many of the problems we face today are as a result of the disastrous banking policies pursued in the last decade or so, not just by Irish banks but also by European banks.  Nothing has been done to bring about changes to ensure this will not happen again.  While I accept that the promissory notes cannot be a prerequisite for passing the treaty, the Government should not drag its feet in this respect; it should continue to try to renegotiate the cost of recapitalising the banks because that is the fundamental problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The treaty will provide confidence for the markets in the future.  Its passage will ensure our ability to avail of the European Stability Mechanism, should we need it.  That is very important.  It seems the treaty is obsessed with fire prevention methods for a house that is already on fire which is how I heard it previously described.  It is a pity there is not more in it to stimulate the economy, as we cannot continue to cut our way to a deficit of 3% of GDP.  The Government needs to stimulate the economy.  We need to ensure we try to grow our way out of our current difficulties.  The 400,000 unemployed want to see what benefits are in it for them to ensure we grow our way out of our problems, rather than cut our way out.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">We need to sell a clear message.  I compliment the IFA which has brought out supporting documentation for its membership.  My party met and discussed the treaty earlier this week.  We will be encouraging our members to engage actively in supporting the referendum and I ask the Tánaiste to ensure we refrain from engaging in partisan politics in the national interest.  As many have alluded to, we run the risk of being left on the platform if the train goes and the referendum is not passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">As there has been a widespread welcome for the fact that we are holding a referendum, I imagine most people are in favour of the Bill.  A few might quibble about the actual wording of the treaty and what is proposed to be inserted into the Constitution because it is definitely minimalist.  However, it has to be so because the treaty, fewer than a dozen pages long, is clear and unambiguous.  Therefore, the wording to be inserted into the Constitution has to be equally clear.  Most of us know what happens when wording in a constitution is not clear.  The wording limits the impact of the treaty to what is included in the treaty and decisions made based on the treaty, rather than trying to anticipate in the Constitution what those decisions might be.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Ideally, the debate should be about the referendum, not about other extraneous matters.  However valid people's concerns are about these matters, considering the state in which the country finds itself, neither emotion nor rhetoric has any role to play in the decision we have to make.  The debate should not be about whether we should be in or out of the euro or whether the treaty is a referendum on the euro because it is not.  It is about giving security and providing certainty and confidence for the markets in our currency and economies.  That is of most significance to us.  We know what the lack of confidence has done to the economy and the lives of the people.  The treaty is about putting in place common rules for those of us who use the common currency in order to ensure that whatever crisis we encounter in the future, it will not be the result of reckless overspending or overdependence on a property bubble or otherwise.  If the markets are to have confidence in our currency, we must be able to demonstrate a commitment to fiscal responsibility and fiscal management.  In fact, one wonders why we have to have a treaty at all.  The reality is that fiscal responsibility is a requirement of a stable currency, no matter what that currency is, be it the euro, the punt, the pound or the yen.  There are very few who question the benefits to Ireland of our participation in the common currency.  It has given us huge advantages as a location for foreign direct investment, as well as enormous trading advantages for indigenous firms.  We have seen huge export growth which is driven by the common currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Even at the peak of the greatest financial crisis, when the world media were speculating about the future of the euro, the value of stocks, shares, bonds and businesses were all evaporating, banks stopped lending to one another and even people in Ireland started queueing to withdraw their money from Irish banks, it is salutary to note that, against that background of a free fall, the value of the euro actually fluctuated very little.  It held its value against other currencies and did so because of the inherent strength of the European economies and the commitment of the richer countries to support and express confidence in the currency in ways that really mattered to the markets.  If we want to regain our sovereignty and cease dependence on the troika, we must be able to borrow on the markets at affordable rates.  If the markets are to lend to us, they will want a reasonable certainty that they will get their money back.  If we vote "No", we will, in effect, be saying "No" to fiscal responsibility and "Yes" to more reckless spending.  Whatever motivation people may have for voting "No", the outcome would be, ironically and tragically, an inability to re-enter the markets and continued subjugation to the troika.  We would then really experience austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">It is popular to blame the European Union for everything and easier to blame than to take responsibility.  However, much as we might deny it and sometimes even resent it, the European Union has been good for us and good to us.  We blame Germany for imposing its will on us and imposing decisions that we did not want.  However, we also blamed it not so long ago for not showing leadership and taking stronger initiatives to stem the financial crisis.  Sometimes we have to remind ourselves that Europe is a club and we all have to pull our weight in that club and show mutual solidarity.  Some have complained, implausibly I believe, that we should vote "No" because we only get access to the ESM if we vote "Yes".  How could anybody expect different?  How could anyone expect the German taxpayer to continue to dish out money if we continue to overspend?  We are still overspending.  We are not in a period of austerity in the way that others have suggested.  We are still budget deficiting and the position here does not begin to approach austerity on the scale that we would and could face if we did not have access to the ESM in future.  I am not willing to take that risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">In addition to that, the European club every day, through the ECB, supports our banks and secures our deposits by replacing inter-bank lending while the banks repair their balance sheets because they simply do not have the money or the competence to lend to one another.  Without that support from the ECB every single day our banks would simply and catastrophically collapse.  The Government guarantee, which gives great comfort to people, is not worth a jot without the support of the ECB.  Ireland would not have the money to meet the demands if deposits were to be withdrawn tomorrow and if we lost the support of the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The European club is now making new rules to protect its members.  The club will continue irrespective of whether we agree to keep to the rules but it is not hard to envisage the kind of future facing a club member that decides it will not agree to the new rules, particularly when rejecting those rules jeopardises all members and even the very existence of the club.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I do not believe the Irish people will reject the treaty.  I am confident they will vote "Yes" and send a strong signal of support for the protection of our currency that means so much to us.  It would be foolhardy to think it is the solution to all our problems.  It is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for recovery, but it will restore confidence which is a precondition for growth.  We have to deal with the problem of ensuring we have better competitiveness in dealing with our debt.  Perhaps it will not be a long-term solution and further integration will be required in the future and we will have to have greater integration of taxes, but that is a matter for another day.  For now, we must deal with today's problem of a crisis in confidence.  Ireland above any other country must know what a loss of confidence means to its future.  We will be to the forefront in welcoming and upholding the new rules.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">The European Union is not perfect, neither is the euro, the Commission, the European Central Bank or even this treaty because if they were perfect we would be finished with them.  Our enterprise would be over and we would move on to something else.  They are human institutions and because they are they are flawed.  They require constant attention, work and endeavours to improve them.  Because they are political, there will not always be a right and a wrong but there will always be a need to engage constantly and work on these institutions because things change.  If an institution cannot change and adapt it will become irrelevant because it will no longer meet the needs of the people or the time that it is there to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I have been reading Fukuyama's book on <i>The Origins of Political Order</i> recently and he talks about the concept of adaptability and when political institutions face decay.  Politics and democracy face decay when political systems fail to adjust to new realities.  That is what we are facing here at present, particularly when we consider the European context.  The European Union and its member states have faced a massive economic shock.  That shock has exposed flaws in the infrastructure and in the institutions - political, financial, economic and social.  We are looking again at everything.  The member states are now changing to try to meet the new changed circumstances, to try to adapt the European institutions and the tools available to us to better meet the needs and circumstances of the people in Europe.  We are not quite sure where that adjustment will take us.  We do not know what the final outcome will be and there will not be a final outcome because it will constantly keep changing.  What we must hope is that we have the right leadership and that it is taking us in the right direction.  However, mistakes will be made because that is human nature and political nature.  Mistakes can sometimes be a good thing because through them we will learn and we will build better institutions but it is a work in progress and a process.  We must continually put our best efforts not into constantly criticising and walking away but into critically engaging to try to improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">In Ireland we are facing the exact same challenge.  We have had a shock to the system and to the country.  Recent history has exposed massively the need for our political institutions and our democracy to change and adjust.  The big question facing us in government is whether we can meet that adjustment but I believe we can meet it.  Then the question remains to what will we adjust and what will we become after this current period where so much is changing and so much needs to change.  What will the outcome of that process be?  We do not yet know.  It is important that it happens.  We must move to a different type of democracy, a more robust democracy, because what we have had before has not served us well and it will not serve us in the future because so much is changing.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The great difficulty for us is that we are not masters of our own fate at present.  Part of our sovereignty has been suspended because of the bailout agreement.  Because of the massive deficit and our inability to borrow aboard at affordable rates we remain too exposed to external events.  Because we cannot borrow aboard on our own at present we are too exposed to dictation and direction from abroad, and that needs to change.  If we are to be able to change the country, as we need to, then we need to regain our independence.  One of the priorities, if not the foremost priority, of the Government is to regain our economic independence, our sovereignty and our ability to borrow abroad independently.  While it might sound counter-intuitive we need access to a permanent bailout fund in order not ever to have need to use it.  We need access to the European Stability Mechanism, either because we will not be able to borrow independently post-2013, and we hope that will not be the case, or that when we go to borrow, we can borrow on more favourable terms because those borrowings will be in effect guaranteed or insured by the European Stability Mechanism.  That is why we need the stability treaty because it will give us access to the ESM.  It does other things as well but those were things we were going to do anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I would like to focus on that one aspect, that the treaty will give us access to the ESM.  That is incredibly important if we are to return as a sovereign nation to the markets abroad.  People will argue about the process involved, the treaty and the fact it contains that clause and let them argue about that but the fact remains this is where we are.  We need to ratify this treaty to get access to the ESM and that is an important thing and no amount of debate will change that.  This is the question that faces us and we must face up to it.  People will use this referendum to talk about things such as fiscal union, debt sustainability, promissory notes and their renegotiation and the future of the euro but this is the wrong campaign for that.  They will use this referendum to talk about water changes, property taxes, the household charge and everything else but it is the wrong referendum for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">What is facing us is quite a simple choice, and Deputy Mitchell referred to this.  It is a simple treaty.  If we choose this treaty, we will have access to the ESM and in that scenario we should be able to return to the foreign markets as an independent sovereign at a closer date.  In that scenario we should be able to exit the bailout agreement on favourable terms to this country and retain our independence.  That is what we as a Government want to achieve.  That is the kind of change we want to see and want to bring into our country and to our political institutions so we can move to a post-bailout scenario and have our independence again.  That is what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Once the referendum is held and if it is passed successfully, and I believe it will be, we can move to the bigger questions and debates that must be held.  We are in a period of such rapid change that we have constantly to keep going back to the table and re-evaluating where it is exactly we are going, not only with the European Union and the other structures that exist with it but with our own political institutions and our own democracy.  Then we can have the big debates and answer the big questions about our institutions and about what needs to happen in this country to improve the circumstances for everybody.  That, ultimately, is the goal of the Government, to improve the circumstances for everybody in this country because they are not great at present.  That is the time to answer those bigger questions.  Right now we have a simple question in front of us.  Let us enter that campaign and let us talk about that and that only and then we can have a bigger debate around the bigger questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">In the upcoming referendum we will be asked to vote "Yes" or "No" to a new EU treaty, a stark "Yes" or "No" to the EU fiscal compact treaty.  Its title is a mouthful and quite uninviting.  It gives the impression that the treaty is complex and that only PhD scholars can read it, debate it or reason its merits.  However, when all the jargon is left to one side, the treaty is quite simple.  It imposes rules on EU countries to ensure governments live within their means.  Spending cannot be greater than what is taken in; it is simple economics.  For the Government, this will mean that our spending on schools, hospitals and playgrounds cannot be greater than our income from taxes such as income and value added tax.  This is not rocket science.  Every student across the country knows we should not spend what we do not have.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">We just need to consider the financial mess Ireland and other countries like Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are in to see the importance of strict spending rules.  The European Stability Mechanism has €800 billion in reserves.  That is significant insurance and it will provide reassurance to investors that the Irish economy is well funded.  Eli Lilly, Microsoft, PayPal, Sky and Hewlett Packard recently invested in Ireland because we are a safe bet, we have access to funding and we are at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">An Irish "No" vote will not stop the treaty from happening.  For the Nice and Lisbon treaties, Ireland's "Yes" vote was essential for them to come into effect.  In those treaties, Ireland had negotiation powers because the other countries needed us to sign and agree to the terms.  This new treaty is different.  It only requires 12 eurozone countries out of 17 to ratify it before it comes into effect.  In this sense, the train is leaving one way or the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">We have no power to ask for changes to its terms as our signature is not needed.  We must decide whether we want to be on that train or not.  We cannot negotiate for a better fare; the train is full with or without us.  If we vote "No", we will still be members of the euro but the closeness of our relationship will be affected.  Like a student that cuts himself off from his family, we will be left vulnerable and isolated.  If we vote "No" we will still have to reduce our deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2015.  This funding is not under threat and the terms under which it is being provided will not change but if we vote "No", we will not receive any support above what is currently agreed in our programme of support from the EU-IMF.  However, like the student, we may face unexpected costs, and like the student that cuts himself off from the family, we might run out of money and options, and into risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">If we vote "Yes", the treaty will come into play when our programme of support ends in 2016.  We will then be required to reduce our deficit from 3% to less than 0.5%.  We will not be required to do this overnight.  We will have a maximum of 20 years to do so and such spending control under the treaty is in our interest.  It will prevent political parties buying elections.  In recent years political success was often bought and such temptation will arise again.  If we vote "Yes", strict money spending controls will prevent this.  A "Yes" vote will reduce political corruption because the Government will not be able to go mad spending before an election to win votes and run up debts.  This treaty will ensure the Government makes long-term plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">We cannot sustain an overspend of €10 billion annually.  A wise parent would not bankroll a student who continually spends beyond what the household can afford.  Likewise, the EU will not continue to support Ireland unless we live within the reality of our situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">As a teacher I always advised students to read an exam question carefully.  When they were finished I advised them to read it again and then again.  The question we will be asked on 31 May is whether Ireland should adopt the EU stability treaty, not if we agree with septic charges or the household charge or whether we like this Government.  If we answer the right question, the answer will be a resounding "Yes".  A "Yes" vote will not reduce us to a student's diet of baked beans but a "No" vote might.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_880">I will start by taking us back a few steps.  To understand where we are now, we must look at where we came from and how we got here.  Sinn Féin's criticism of the Maastricht treaty and the proposition of economic and monetary union related to the idea of a one size fits all policy working.  We said having a single interest rate for all of the eurozone would not work.  During our economic bubble, we could have done with raising interests to slow down the overheating of the economy that we are all paying for now in such a profound way.  Unfortunately that was not within our gift.  Economic policies served the interests of Germany, in particular, and other core states.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The free flow of money from the core European banking system out into the periphery was another factor.  In Greece's case, this was done with the assistance of false reporting by Goldman Sachs on the strength of the Greek Government's sovereign capacity, and in Ireland's case it was done through investment in private banks.  The combination of artificially low interest rates and cheap credit in Ireland was like crack cocaine.  The average person watching television at home was told he or she would be crazy not to buy property, that house prices were only going one way and he must get on the train and be quick about it.  The practice of the old prudent bank manager, where he would lend three and a half or four times a person's annual salary where that person could provide a 10% deposit to prove he had the capacity to save, was thrown out the window while the moral hazard of incentives for bank managers for approving 100% plus mortgages and further loans was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The crisis did not have its genesis in Irish folly and recklessness, although it was encouraged by the Government and economists and bankers whom we were told were prudent and sensible.  This mess is of its nature a European one caused by the distortions created by economic and monetary union.  When Europe was forced to face the reality that monetary union was failing badly, with a series of bailouts, it failed again.  Rather than countering the recessionary - even depressionary - cycle, it has gone the other way to become pro-cyclical.  It is an insane policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">This is a European crisis by design but has the burden been shared?  Absolutely not.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">If debt brakes and deficit ceilings could have solved or prevented the Irish economic crisis, I ask those on the "Yes" side to explain why, for most of the years of our membership of the eurozone, we stayed within the Maastricht criteria of a 3% deficit ceiling and 60% debt to GDP ratio.  It was only when we were saddled with the banking debt that we fell outside them.  Even those mechanisms failed to identify a fundamental failure in our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">People have referred to the fact that 20% of our tax revenue came from construction alone.  It was out of kilter.  We were building 95,000 houses at the peak of the boom for a population of 4.5 million.  It was almost the same number as was being built in Britain, with a population of 60 million.  It did not take an economist to figure out that something was badly wrong, yet none of the Maastricht criteria succeeded in addressing those fundamental failures.  How will they work now?  If they had been the solution, we would not have had this crisis in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">In an article in Monday's <i>New York Times</i>, which was reprinted in yesterday’s <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman commented on the crisis in Spain in particular and in the eurozone in general as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_887">When the bubble burst, the Spanish economy was left high and dry; Spain's fiscal problems are a consequence of its depression, not its cause.  Nonetheless, the prescription coming from Berlin and Frankfurt is, you guessed it, even more fiscal austerity.  This is, not to mince words, just insane... Rather than admit that they've been wrong, European leaders seem determined to drive their economy - and [just as importantly] their society - off a cliff.  And the whole world will pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Krugman went on to criticise the fiscal treaty as locking in "fiscal austerity as the response to any and all problems".  Another Nobel Prize winner for economics, Joseph Stiglitz, has described the European response to the crisis as a "mutual suicide pact".  That is very strong language for an eminent economist.  Their comments were echoed by yet another world renowned economist, Nouriel Roubini, who correctly forecast the current crash:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_889">Thanks to the fiscal compact, even the eurozone's core will be forced into front-loaded recessionary austerity... The trouble is that the eurozone has an austerity strategy but no growth strategy.  And, without that, all it has is a recession strategy that makes austerity and reform self-defeating, because, if output continues to contract, deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to unsustainable levels.  Moreover, the social and political backlash eventually will become overwhelming.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">That is dramatic language from another internationally renowned economist analysing what is taking place in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Krugman, Stiglitz and Roubini reflect a widespread view that the EU has misdiagnosed the economic crisis.  The proposed new treaty seeks to assign that misdiagnosis the status of constitutional law.  It is akin to a doctor prescribing an inappropriate treatment to a patient and then legally debarring the patient from exploring any alternative treatments.  This is why opposition to the treaty is growing across the eurozone, and it is those voices of opposition that I principally wish to draw to the attention of the House, not least because the voices from the rest of Europe that the House and its committees have heard from so far have all been in support of the treaty.  There is serious concern internationally and across Europe about the direction being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">I wish to respond to some of the comments from the other side of the House about Sinn Féin's historical analysis.  It is as if Sinn Féin was on the margins of Europe in its constructive criticism of the direction Europe has been taking.  I argue that we are in the mainstream of social democratic or left wing thinking in Europe.  At times that is in the majority but currently it is in the minority.  However, in the near future it will be back in the majority again, and we are right at the centre of it in our analysis of the dismantling of social Europe.  Those who have a very right wing analysis believe in light-touch regulation, privatisation, liberalisation, breaking down public services and driving back workers' rights and entitlements.  That approach has led to this crisis.  We let the financial markets and the banks roam free and we now have this catastrophe in Ireland and in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I will now focus on some of the commentary from across Europe.  Before doing so, however, I remind the House of the background to the first Lisbon treaty referendum in Ireland.  It did not come out of nowhere.  There was a proposition to have a European constitution, drafted by the mandarins and the elite in the corridors of Brussels and Strasbourg.  It was put to the people of France and meetings were held across that country in town halls, libraries and public buildings, but the people rejected the proposition.  It was not for xenophobic or regressive reasons but for progressive reasons.  They wanted to reclaim the vision of Europe that Francois Mitterand, Jacques Delors and others had, so they rejected the European constitution in the referendum.  The people of Holland did likewise.  It was only afterwards that Europe closed down the constitution and repackaged 98% of it into what was to become the Lisbon treaty.  The Irish people were the third to reject the proposition, and Sinn Féin was not alone on the fringes of Europe but at the centre of it in constructively and critically taking on those who were stealing the dream that was social Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">With that in mind I will turn to some of the commentary in Europe on this treaty.  It is clear that when Sinn Féin calls on the Irish people to vote "No" to the treaty it is not to isolate Ireland from Europe but to strengthen our bonds with people across Europe who are sick and tired of austerity, unemployment and their public services being systematically dismantled.  There is a very good chance that Francois Hollande will be the next President of France.  We are familiar with the term "Merkozy", the partnership of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy and how it has pushed forward and pushed everybody else aside.  That will come apart if Francois Hollande is elected.  Interestingly, the BBC reports today that he outlined a number of reasons for opposing the treaty and what he would seek to renegotiate it.  It included dropping plans to anchor deficit reduction rules in countries' constitutions.  That is a huge statement.  He is making clear, among other things, that to attach these arbitrary draconian targets, particularly to countries that are in a programme, are struggling and are saddled with banking debt, is insane.  This is possibly the next President of France, somebody with whom we will seek to build strategic alliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Doctor Herta Daubler-Gmelin, a former Minister for Justice in the German Government, is pursuing a constitutional case for a referendum on the treaty, saying: "I am all for Europe, just not one determined by political elites".  Dr. H.J. Witteveen, a former Minister for Finance in the Netherlandsand a former director of the IMF, calls the treaty "unreasonable and dangerous".  Again, that is strong language.  The Social Democratic Party in Sweden has argued that, "Sweden should not transfer power to decide on financial policy from Riksdagen [the national parliament], nor give the European Court of Justice the possibility to decide on sanctions on the basis of the Fiscal Compact".  Also in Sweden, the EU legal expert of the national trade union confederation has said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_896">Budget policy and financial policy is being dragged out of legitimate democratic institutions in favour of a supranational technocracy.  Democracy at the national level is being hollowed out, and it is not replaced by a new supranational democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">This view is shared by the head of the Danish central bank, who told the Danish Parliament: "I think that what we are seeing at the European level is the bureaucratisation of economic policy".</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The Swedish trade unions are in line with the European Trade Union Confederation which has, for the first time ever, opposed a treaty.  Of course, this is not an EU treaty but a number of member states have signed up to it, if not yet ratified it.  Does this not say everything?  The European Trade Union Confederation whose members passionately believe in a social Europe now sees that the dream could be lost if this direction is taken.  The confederation says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">The new Treaty is only stipulating more of the same: austerity and budgetary discipline.  It will force member states to pursue damaging pro-cyclical fiscal policies, giving absolute priority to rigid economic rules at a time when mosteconomies are still weak and unemployment intolerably high.  It will bring downwards pressure on wages and working conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The Portuguese campaign for an audit of their national debt, representing a broad swathe of Portuguese civil society, is similarly opposed to the treaty.  I quote the campaign:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_901">Sooner or later, this treaty will be revoked because countries will be unable to comply with its conditions.  Until then, it will make austerity harder and more aggressive.  It is not a treaty on stability, co-ordination or governance but a treaty on austerity, inequality and destruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Heikki Patomaki, Professor of World Politics at the University of Helsinki, Finland, slates the treaty's anti-democratic nature.  I quote him:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_903">The exceptional provisions allowed for under the terms of the fiscal compact are hostile to the basic principles of democracy, as is the fact that the compact gives rise to legal norms which override EU member states' own constitutions, and which cannot be changed by democratic means.  In a democracy no rule or principle can ever be set in stone, but must always be adapted to the possibilities and constraints at hand.  From this perspective, Merkel's idea of unending budgetary discipline is anti-democratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Yiorgos Vassalos, of the highly respected Corporate Europe Observatory organisation, a long time monitor of how big business influences the EU policy agenda, notes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_905">The fiscal treaty mirrors the proposals of big business lobby groups to strengthen the Commission's capacity to determine the economic policies of EU member states.  The fiscal compact would transfer excessive new powers to the European Commission, an unelected body with strong links to corporate lobbies.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_906">National parliaments would lose control, while no democratic control mechanism is foreseen at the EU level.  Thus the fiscal compact spells out an authoritarian form of economic governance at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">A wide swathe of opinion is opposed to the treaty.  I could talk about the Dutch labour party and German social democrats.  There is widespread concern across Europe at the implications of this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Our people should have the freedom and capacity to look at this treaty on its merits or demerits and make their decision.  I appeal to the Government to cut out the nonsense about conditionality of access to European Stability Mechanism funding, the blackmail clause.  The Government has not ratified the European Stability Mechanism.  It holds a veto in terms of the amendment to Article 136.  Sinn Féin brought forward a Private Members' motion asking the Government not to introduce the ESM legislation until the people had their say on the austerity treaty.  I commend the Government on having done that.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The Government must now allow the people decide on the capacity of the treaty for stability, as the Government claims, or austerity, as we argue, and make up their own minds without this threat.  The Government can undertake not to implement the ESM treaty and the conditionality that comes with it if the people reject this treaty.  It should defend the Irish people's interest and state that this is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Ministers and Deputies from the Government parties have said the austerity treaty is not a big deal and that we already have its measures in the six pack.  If we are meeting the commitments of the six pack, are the poster boys for austerity and are complying with the requirements of the troika, who are in Ireland at present to make another tick on our scorecard, how can we be refused access to ESM funding?  This is an empty threat, but a threat nonetheless.  I appeal to the Government to remove that threat, which it has the power to do, and give the people capacity to make up their own minds.  The Government cannot say to the Irish people that they will be isolated within Europe if they reject the proposition when I have just read out the range of public opinion across almost every member state that is stacked against the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">People are disgusted and disillusioned.  They believe the political institutions of Europe have failed them and have moved away from the promise of a social Europe and the positive achievements of the European Union towards a big business dominated agenda.  Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Mario Monti, the technocratic Prime Minister of Italy and Lucas Papademos, the technocratic Prime Minister of Greece all come from the Goldman Sachs stable.  This is insanity.  Our people see those at the higher echelons who caused this crisis being rewarded.  There are those in the trade union movement across Europe who refer to this treaty as proof of a right wing coup.  Is that what we want?  Do we want more Thatcherism or more equality?  Do we want more of the promise of social Europe?  That is our challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Our people should not have this threat hung over them with the compliance and assistance of our Government.  If that threat is removed we can have a proper debate with space for the Irish people to have their say.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_913">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important watershed issue in Irish politics and economics.  I will not take the advice of my colleague across the House to heed the words of Paul Krugman or of any other world expert.  This is one for us.  The ordinary people of this country must come to a judgment on this matter.  Do we want to look to the future alone and with a tear in our eye, or be resolute, take our responsibilities seriously, stand up and be counted, assert ourselves as real members of the European Union and take our place proudly without fear or favour among the nations of the European Union?  Do we want to ape those who have made mistakes and take the advice of people who followed those who were wrong, and there were many of them?</p>
          <p eId="para_914">There are as many diverse economic opinions as there are blades of grass in Croke Park.  For the last ten years we have been entertained by those who said we were going great and that this was the way to go.  They said everything was easy and that we were making a bag of money.  They said it was a great time to be here and we should take these opportunities.  No one wanted to hear reality.  This is reality.  This is real time.  We face it in the clear knowledge that the decision we take will have a serious impact on where we go in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">We talk about austerity as though it were an end in itself.  It is not.  It is a means to an end and it must be a means to recovery.  There is no sense in spending more money if we are still sliding down the tunnel.  In 1977, economic experts decided that we needed economic stimulus and to spend more money and generate consumer demand.  That is what the people voted for, because it was easy.  We must get away from easy.  This is not about easy.  This is about responsibility.  The most important thing about the 1977 stimulus package was that within 18 months the country was broke.  People seem to have forgotten that we have not repaid that debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">We are paying it back and will still be paying it back <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The only thing that happened in the intervening years was, particularly in regard to property - as property prices imploded - that inflation took control and relative to our borrowings our economic growth overtook it and they were that much less.  However, it has not gone away.  Like everyone else in this House I have dealt with as many serious debt situations as anyone in Europe.  There is a golden rule that when one owes money that one must face the reality in the first instance and accept that it is a fact.  I do not care who did it.  It is easy for us on this side of the House to say we know who is responsible but there is no sense in trying to pretend that what happened did not happen under the auspices, approval and aegis of the agencies in this country.  I refer to the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance and others.  That carries the sovereign stamp and when we say we will not pay and that we will walk away, what we are saying is that our stamp means nothing in the future.  We do not mean what we say.  We must accept responsibility for whatever has happened.  We must do that as a people.  If we do not do so, although I am not an expert, I predict serious problems in future if we go down the road of pretending that someone somewhere is going to be very nice to us, will lift us up by our bootstraps, pat us on the head, hose us down and say “Come on, are you not Irish?  Don’t we love you all and sure we could not leave you out there in the cold.”  This is the real world.  This is real time.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Austerity is not an end; it is a means to economic recovery.  It is not forever, nor should it be, but there must be a recognition and realisation that we could not continue the way we were.  If anyone in this House is suggesting – Professor Krugman or anyone else – that we should continue the way we were and spend money the way we did for the past ten or 15 years and think we are going to recover, they should think again.  One of the solutions that has been put forward from the United States – by Professor Krugman – is that full integration of economic and fiscal policy is the only way it could work.  They have that in the United States and let us look at what happened there.  Some of the banks did not work out all that well and the economy is heavily borrowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I do not think we need to take advice from anybody.  We must judge it for ourselves.  The people in this country who are about to vote in the referendum must judge it for themselves.  What they must consider is what is the safest bet if in doubt on this occasion.  It used to be said in previous referenda that if in doubt one should vote "No".  The reverse is the case this time.  If there is any doubt people must vote "Yes" in their own interest because it is in the interest of the people of this country that they take the right decision.  It is not for politicians to make the decision for them.  My colleague across the House, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, is correct; we must let the people decide.  It is now their turn to take responsibility and they must remember that the result will be on their heads.  On our heads will be the result as well.  If the people of this country make the wrong decision we will all pay for that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I would love to be able to blame Fianna Fáil for where we are but the fact is that whatever happened got some approval from the people.  People voted for it.  The reason they voted for it is because people vote for something that sounds easy.  Politically, it is a great thing to do.  They would be fools not to, on the basis that the rewards would be to the people.  However, the rewards were not to the people; the cost was to the people.  We are paying for it, which is a sad thing.  In my time in this House – I am here a couple of years – I saw all of that happen.  I am ashamed to say that I was unable to convince anyone as to what might happen, and it happened.  Our worst fears were realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">People have asked why the Lisbon Agenda did not succeed.  It was said that low interest rates were the cause of the problem.  They were not.  There was plenty of scope to introduce credit controls, as is the case now.  Interest rates are low now but there is no difficulty with them since recognition dawned.  Economic lunacy was what happened.  There is nothing better than low interest rates to generate employment and economic growth, but one must put them to the right use.  Unfortunately, in this country we decided to spend the money.  We were supposed to be the richest country in the world.  Does the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews, remember that?  We might have been the richest country in the world but we put our money into property.  One could ask where it is now.  The property has devalued so we are no longer the richest country in the world.  I appeal to the people in this country, in the interests of the country and of future generations to vote "Yes".</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_921">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the referendum and to say how important it is to our future economic activity and opportunities to ensure that people stay and work in this country and that we have a vibrant, developing, progressive economy.  We are one of the 17 members of the eurozone.  We are part of a market of 500 million people.  That market is vital to trade and future growth.  Unfortunately, because of decisions made by the previous Government we are now dependent on international institutions to pay our pensions, salaries to the public service to keep hospitals open and pay for doctors, nurses and other services, education, schools and public services in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Unfortunately, we have seen living standards drop.  They depend on our reputation as a strong and stable place to do business.  The treaty will give that message which will attract business and investment to this country.  The euro is the currency of the Republic of Ireland.  Previously we had the Irish pound or the punt as it was known.  It is the money with which we trade and have in our pockets.  It is the currency we save, spend and with which we purchase services.  The future health of the euro matters personally to each one of us.  It is our currency and we want nothing more than is due to people, namely, to live in this country where we can find decent work, have a home, take care of our families, watch our children grow up in the company of their friends, see our children educated and have a livelihood in the country and as the cycle of life continues that in our elderly years we receive proper treatment and have a quality of life we deserve having contributed to the State through our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">A crucial tool available to us at present for which the treaty has implications is the firewall in the European Stability Mechanism.  Any country which ratifies the stability treaty will have access to it.  If any country does not ratify the stability treaty it will not have access to the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">This is a treaty on stability and is about ensuring a stable currency for Ireland; ensuring a stable euro.  It is about confidence abroad and maintaining and enhancing the influence which we have built up with many investors.  We have seen progress in that area in recent weeks and months in international companies looking to invest in the country but we must enhance our influence to attract those companies and to influence our European partners.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">The treaty itself is important.  What we are asked to do is reduce the underlying Government deficit to no more than 0.5% of everything produced in the economy in any year.  It asks for countries to abide by a common set of rules, but there is flexibility in times of crisis.  When the economy weakens, the country can support spending and jobs by borrowing and when the economy grows strongly, the Government repays public debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The treaty also asks countries to bring, over a period of 20 years, their total Government debt, including money borrowed in previous years, down to a safe level of 60% of the total output and if countries are in exceptional circumstances, these rules are suspended and Governments can borrow more to support jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">If that formula had been in existence and honoured over the past 15 years, we would not be in the present crisis, we would not be cutting back services, we would not have our tax going abroad to service a debt to ensure a reduced level of services, we would not have our people leaving the country as is happening and we would not have the level of unemployment that we are sustaining.  If the formula which this treaty puts into existence was in existence, we would not be in the present crisis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_929">I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews, for affording me the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on this important Bill.  No doubt this is one of the most important pieces of legislation which has come before the House during my brief time as a Member.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">On 31 May we will seek direction from the people as to the course this country must navigate, not only during the lifetime of this Government but for that of many generations to come.  As we embark on the campaign ahead of the vote next month, it is important that we foster reasoned debate and engage with the electorate in a responsible manner, not on the basis of empty rhetoric or misinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">What is at stake in this referendum is far too important to constitute a playing field for self-interested partisan political games, and yet elements of the Opposition - we heard it here today and yesterday - have already begun propagating untruths in an effort to mobilise against this treaty the very sections of society that stand to suffer most if the treaty, and its safeguards and assurances, are rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">It was interesting to hear earlier Deputy Mac Lochlainn refer to this as an austerity treaty.  If Ireland does not have access to the ESM which would severely weaken our ability to borrow funds in future at affordable interest rates, and if the Government is unable to borrow these funds, the budget deficits that we incur, most likely, would have to be eliminated immediately through cuts in public expenditure and an increase in taxation.  In a way, rejecting the treaty could lead to even more austerity and job losses than accepting the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">It has also been falsely claimed, for instance, that the stability treaty represents a further concession in our sovereignty to the European Union.  I agree in certain respects in that regard because it compromises our sovereign ability to be reckless and to be irresponsible, as has been demonstrated by previous Administrations.  It is simply a solemn agreement among independent democratic states to conform with principles of fiscal rectitude and good governance for the good of their people.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The concept that fiscal and economic criteria must be adhered to by member states of the European project is nothing new.  We saw it in Maastricht and in the six pack reforms which were introduced last year.  We have seen it on a number of the treaties that have already been approved.  Given our calamitous recent economic history, no nation more than the Irish should appreciate the potential benefits of enforceable fiscal guidelines that this treaty will introduce.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The auction politics engaged in by our predecessors have seen Governments espouse reckless unsustainable policies with a view only to the next general election and with a view to a return to office in subsequent elections.  State coffers have been grievously abused in order to purchase short-term electoral success without the slightest regard for the long-term national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Far from benefitting from these give-away budgets, it is the taxpayer who is now paying the price.  The nation's purse has been bled dry and the politicians who emptied it have retired from this House on their colossal pensions with the exception of a notable few, Deputy Martin and my constituency colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív.  It is difficult to assess where Deputy Ó Cuív stands in this regard - his comments yesterday would suggest he is opposing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Perhaps, if these controls were in place when Deputies Martin and Ó Cuív were sitting around the Cabinet table, we would not find ourselves in the position that we are today.  The disastrous economic policies pursued by the previous Administrations would have been flagged early in the form of the macroeconomic imbalances that would have shown up had these controls been in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_939">We are against the fiscal treaty for the economic reasons outlined already in this debate by some of my ULA colleagues, but also on the grounds of the attack that it represents on democracy.  Quite a fundamental shift is taking place.  It is really a fundamental attack on the basic democratic right to elect a Government and have that Government decide on budgetary and economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Of course, we are not naive enough to think that democracy is wholesome in our economy.  We live in a society which is not very democratic at all and which is run, as the Occupy protesters correctly pointed out, for the 1%, not the 99%, and the power of the 1% flows from their ownership of the key resources in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">We have a system of so-called parliamentary democracy where people can elect Members once every five years and put them under a certain amount of pressure.  At European level, there is not even this level of parliamentary democracy because we have a system where real power lies with the unelected European Commission and the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Limited and all as it is, the process that is unfolding with the fiscal treaty makes it even worse, and it is part of a process.  The six pack economic governance shifted important powers away from elected governments to the unelected European Commission, made changes in how voting rights were carried out etc.  This treaty takes that a step further and is a significant attack on basis democratic rights.  I will explain those points with reference to a couple of the articles in the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">First, there is the balanced budget rule, which effectively ties the hands of future Governments to the same economic policies as this one.  In essence, we are being wedded to neoliberalism and austerity.  It rules out Governments having the ability to run structural deficits, which could be used for investment in vital public works to engage in necessary public spending to reinvigorate the economy.  We must ask ourselves whether surely one of the most basic requirements of a democracy is that people would be free to vote for a Government and free to vote for different economic policies.  In essence, what we are getting here is the old Ford phrase - you can have any colour as long as it is black.  Now, you can have any government you like as long as it is neoliberal.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">It is true that this treaty is not unique in that regard.  It is part of a process where economic policy is being handed over to technocrats.  What we see is a conscious attempt to use the crisis that is unfolding to move economic policy out of the sphere of democratic discussion and turn it into a so-called technical question.  What we are being told is that neoliberalism should not be a policy choice as it is really about responsible behaviour.  That is the excuse we got to justify the removal of elected governments in Italy and Greece and to have them replaced by bankers, which is an absolutely retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The second key proposal which diminishes democracy is the mechanism for countries to be effectively placed into administration.  This comes under Article 5 of the treaty, which states that countries in an excessive deficit procedure have to put in place a budgetary and economic partnership programme, including a detailed description of the structural reforms which must be put in place and implemented to ensure an effective and durable correction of their excessive deficits.  These programmes will have to be endorsed and monitored by the European Commission and Council and, in essence, it is a surrender of budgetary powers to the Commission and to the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">While we do not have the time today to develop the points, similarly, Article 7 in essence creates a bloc for austerity within the EU.  It creates, if one likes, a sort of caucus of the austerity club where people are required to come together in advance and sign up to the idea of austerity.  It is an extension of the new form of voting which was introduced under the six pack, reverse majority voting, which means the Council-----</p>

          <p eId="para_950">Would the Deputy acknowledge that the Commission is comprised of Commissioners who are there by virtue of mandates they received from their respective Governments?  If the European Union member states keep electing right wing or centre right governments in the main, then there will be a right wing or neoliberal agenda in terms of how the Commission does its business.  Would the Deputy also acknowledge we now have a co-decision procedure where directly elected parliamentarians in the European Parliament co-decide with the Council of Ministers and with the Commission, and more and more of that agenda is done on a co-decision procedure in terms of the competences of the European Union?  Would she not agree also that the Stability and Growth Pact is something we have already signed up to, is laid down and was agreed by the citizens of Europe?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_951">I would not.  I would require considerably more than two minutes to unravel the undemocratic mess that is the European Commission and Council, and how people end up there.  The fact that a number of governments across Europe may be slightly more dominated by right wing elements is neither here nor there.  What we are talking about is enshrining the policies of those right wing governments that are currently in place in perpetuity in a new treaty by signing up to their very policies of neoliberalism itself.  That is, in essence, what is happening by signing up and handing over in that regard.  Obviously, the Minister of State disagrees but we do not have time in this debate to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">Article 7 of the austerity treaty tries to create a caucus of the austerity club where countries within the EU structures support the Commission's proposals for sanctions or fines on non-performing countries.  While I do not have a chance now to go into the detail of that, the new methods of voting which have been introduced, such as reverse majority voting and so on, are inherently undemocratic.  What it means is that the Council is presumed to agree with the sanctions unless a qualified majority vote against it.  What it really means is that the sanctions are presumed to be implemented and one would need a huge majority to overturn them.  If the peripheral nations still had their votes, they would not have a chance of defeating it if the major northern Governments were not in favour of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">We do not have the time to develop the points now.  The key decision making is being taken out of the hands of the European Council, to which the Minister of State referred, and put into the hands of this so-called austerity club.  It extends the process too far.  For that reason and the other economic ones, we will be opposing the treaty.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_954">I too have serious question marks over the lack of democracy in the European set-up at the moment.  I am afraid I cannot help having the impression that the Germans, who pay most into it, also have the most say.  One might say that is fair enough but they seem to have all the say at the moment.  It was interesting yesterday to hear that a strong member of the Bundesbank, Dr. Andreas Dombret:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_955">...urged troubled euro-area governments such as Spain to set aside short-term growth concerns and press ahead with budget cuts to win back investor confidence.  ‘Putting too much weight on short-term, demand-side risks misjudges the root cause of the current crisis, namely a profound loss of confidence in markets...  Taking consolidation plans too lightly might give some relief in the short term, but it also undermines the credibility of medium-term budget goals.'</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I do not like the sound of that.  Clearly, the Germans are in a very different position to ourselves.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_957">Turning to the German economy, Europe's largest, Dombret said it is in ‘remarkably good shape,' and growth should gather pace as unemployment at a two-decade low fuels domestic demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">It would be great if it does fuel domestic demand in Germany and if the Germans are encouraged to spend a bit more, as it would address some of the imbalances that exist in Europe, which are a huge problem for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I read a very interesting piece from Dr. John O'Brennan and Professor Seán Ó Riain from NUI Maynooth:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_960">Chancellor Angela Merkel has argued that such policies, combined with efforts to improve competitiveness, represent a strongly pro-European response to the crisis.  She argues that such measures will rebuild trust in finances and between governments and will require greater strengthening of the centre in Europe and deeper political union.  [The sad fact is that] this fiscal rectitude has historically been part of a much broader social and economic compact – the other elements of which are missing in the current European fiscal compact.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_961">A crucial element in those models was a focus not on austerity but on prudent egalitarian productive investment...  Where the bailout programmes have emphasised competitiveness through cost cutting and weakening social protections, the European model was based on quality production, worker participation and strong social protections and investments.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_962">The compact then is an attempt to manage Europe through the short term crisis by imposing discipline on government finances, betting that the process of "deleveraging" of debts will be easier to manage through states and citizens than through a restructuring of the financial system.  The additional social and economic measures that were crucial to the success of such fiscally disciplined economies as Germany and the Nordics are not part of the promised road to recovery [for ourselves].</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The authors also make the point:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_964">...the other elements that might make such an outcome more likely are missing, or suppressed.  In such circumstances, it is not surprising that the peripheral countries fear that the fiscal compact will simply quarantine the healthier economies in Europe from the difficulties across the eurozone as a whole.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_965">There are real dilemmas here – uneven development in the European Union is a serious problem and interacts disastrously with liberal capital markets and state deficits.  But it is striking how small a role has been given to European institutions such as the structural funds programme or the European Investment Bank in promoting an investment-led recovery.  Indeed, it seems likely that structural funds will go unspent in the current period.  The marketisation of continental European banking has fuelled a turn away from productive investment and the funds provided to European banks are still as likely to be used for financial trading as for productive lending.  The trillion or more in liquidity provided to banks comes with few strings attached in terms of the banks' role in recovery.  Policy decisions that could provide national governments with fiscal space to generate economic recovery, including rescheduling debt repayments, are largely ignored.  Cross-national investments in vital infrastructure for the knowledge economy could be encouraged further.  Institutional changes in terms of financial regulation, promotion of active labour market policies and industrial upgrading - vital to recovery across the periphery - could be advanced.  A politics of rule-making and rectitude, necessary in many respects, must be accompanied by a politics of society-building and recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The sooner we realise that it is not all about money and economics, the better.  Only then might we have a better chance of getting back to a decent level.  Those in the Government can talk all they wish about exports surviving through these times but they should hold up their hands and admit that they have done nothing for the domestic economy, where most of the population work and on which most of the population depends.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">It is difficult to offer a detailed alternative when during the past year we have continuously raised alternatives to the policies dealing with wealth, public spending, creating jobs and the national jobs plan.  I wish to deal with some points made during the debate.  Deputy Donohoe summed up the argument for the "Yes" side when he said, "Show me the money."  Are we to see posters in the campaign stating "Vote Yes for a second bailout", with the phrase "even though we will not need it" in small print?  I remember the posters from previous campaigns on EU-related referendums calling on voters to "Vote Yes for jobs" and those which stated "Europe is working".  However, Europe is not working.  Unemployment in the European Union is approaching 25 million.  In Greece the unemployment level is 24% and at an outrageous level of 60% among young people.  In Spain, unemployment is 23% and at an outrageous level of 50% for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">These figures are comparable to the mass unemployment at the height of the 1930s great depression.  Ireland and Greece have suffered an economic slump of 1930s proportions.  There has been a 6% fall in output in Greece year on year, totalling between 16% and 20% from peak levels.  The position of Ireland is worse with national output down by 24% from the peak, ten times the level during normal recessions.  We are committing ourselves to a binding fiscal treaty.  We need a proper, adult discussion on the crisis and its possible solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">People have lost their jobs and their homes.  Among the most vivid images from this recession and the attendant austerity are the pictures we saw in the newspapers this morning taken in an affluent area of the city.  A man of 71 years and a woman of 63 years were dragged from their homes by representatives of a bank that we own.  This was done by four burly bailiffs while the Garda protected the property for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.  These images will cause outrage among the people in the coming period because they are the images of austerity and recession.  I do not envisage the Government resolving the problems the images illustrate in respect of insolvency for homes etc.  The families who have virtually nothing left to live on after paying bills deserve a serious discussion on the pros and cons of the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">I call on Deputy "show me the money" Donohoe to reflect and question whether the options and alternatives were carefully weighted up when the previous Government adopted the blanket guarantee of the banks.  They were not.  We heard nonsensical views, including the view that there would be no cash in the ATMs unless we took action.  That poorly informed, inadequate discussion condemned and burdened the State with an unsustainable level of debt and disastrous consequences.  In addition we have been subject to four years of austerity which have collapsed demand, activity and jobs in the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The fiscal treaty will enshrine into enforceable rules a policy that is not working and that will prolong and deepen the slump in countries such as Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  It will prolong and deepen the recession and the levels of unemployment in the eurozone as a whole.  Austerity is not a solution; it is part of the problem.  Voting "No" is not an act of insanity since what the Government is doing is not working.  A sane person would stop and begin to examine seriously the alternatives.  I will campaign vigorously for a "No" vote in my constituency, Dublin South-Central, in the coming six weeks and I am confident the people there will vote "No" against this austerity fiscal treaty.</p>

        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_976">I will campaign and vote against the fiscal compact treaty because I believe the long-term interests of the country are best served by running our own affairs.  My opinion is not driven by nationalism or a dislike of Europe.  It is driven by the fact that I believe power should rest as closely as possible with the people.  The treaty is a further erosion and distancing of this power.  It will take more power away from the ordinary citizen and put it in the hands of unelected officials in the commission and judges in the European Union Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">In the past I have been a fan of the European Union but this was only until the leaders of France and Germany became the <i>de facto</i> leaders of the EU.  The reality is that no matter what system of rules are introduced into the European Union, Germany and France will do whatever they wish regardless of what suits peripheral states such as Ireland.  Germany broke the rules related to the Maastricht treaty at will.  Now, in order that it does not occur again, the same country that was most persistent in breaking these rules is putting the gun to our head so that future offenders will be punished.  As far as sticking to treaties is concerned, Germany and France do not give tuppence.  A French Minister, Pierre Lellouche, has stated that the bailout funds were expressly forbidden in treaties but that did not matter at all.  Germany will always do what is best for Germany.  When Ireland needed higher interest rates to cool down our over-heating economy, the Germans needed low interest rates.  Which got its way?  Germany did.  As a result Ireland was flooded with money which, along with light-touch regulation, inflated prices and knocked our economy completely out of sync with reality.  It remains there.  This should come as no surprise since many people, including Anthony Coughlan, warned from the outset that this would occur.  There is now talk of putting another belt on the straitjacket which has largely strangled this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">We are informed that we will face vast cuts in living standards if we do not vote for the treaty.  It is clear that if we vote for the treaty we will face even greater cuts.  As part of the treaty we are expected to reduce our debt to GDP ratio to 60%.  This is to be achieved by reducing debt by 5% per year over a 20 year period.  We must get our budget deficit down to 0.5% of GDP as well.  The only way we can achieve this without destroying our economy is by a vast write-down of debt, debt which was not ours in the first instance.  Unfortunately, this is something the Taoiseach will not consider.  To achieve this we must run the equivalent of budget surpluses of between €3 billion and €4 billion per year for the next 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">We are informed that the alternative to voting for the treaty is that funding would be cut off from the country and the banking system would collapse.  If someone puts a gun to my head, my instinct is to say, "Pull the trigger".  I do so on the basis of life experience which tells me that bullies are in fact cowards.  Pulling the trigger has consequences on both sides.  If funding is withdrawn from our banking system and our country collapses, many people throughout Europe would stand to lose tens of billions of euro.  This is a risk I do not believe those in Europe are willing to take.  Instead of working out how one can save the un-salvageable, Europe should work towards helping countries such as Ireland to exit the eurozone.  It does not suit anyone in Europe for Ireland to crash and burn under a mountain of unsustainable debt.  However, that is what will occur if we do not take radical action.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">This treaty will not create stability; it will create the opposite.  It will create the very thing that Angela Merkel is afraid of, that is, an environment where extremism will thrive and desperation will become the main motivation behind people's actions.  I will conclude with a recent observation by Paul Krugman, an excellent economist respected all over the world: "Rather than admit that they've been wrong, European leaders seem determined to drive their economy - and their society - off a cliff."  Between now and referendum day I will do my damnedest to make sure the Government does not let that happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">I respect his view although I disagree with it.  I would be interested to hear Deputies Flanagan and Joan Collins say whether they would consider us to have a better chance of running our affairs if the treaty is accepted or if it is rejected.  Does Deputy Collins believe we will have more or less austerity if it is defeated?  Many articles have been quoted from colleagues on that side of the House to support their case.  Mr. Krugman's ears must be very red.  In an article of his on 11 March to which rather less reference was made, Mr. Krugman said: "You may ask what alternatives countries like Greece and Ireland had, and the answer is that they had and have no good alternatives".  In other words, while he has offered a major critique of the strategy in the eurozone, he has formed the view that Ireland, among others, has little choice in regard to where it finds itself.  I do not accept that we are without choices, but I am strongly of the view that if this referendum is defeated, we will have more austerity, not less.  That is absolutely clear and without question.  We have a deficit of €15 billion and nobody willing to lend to us.  Were we to decide, as Deputy Flanagan advocates, to leave the currency, we would simply isolate ourselves from any prospect of recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">It is not for the optics that I acknowledge that the treaty is not perfect.  In fact, I do not accept it is the solution to the problems in the eurozone.  Moreover, I very much agree with some of the points made by Deputy Mick Wallace and others in regard to the huge economic imbalances that exist across the eurozone countries.  That is a major issue that must be addressed.  It may even be more at the heart of the collapse in Ireland than fiscal indiscipline ever was.  I agree with Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn that if the rules set out in the stability treaty had been in place for the past ten years they would not, on their own, have addressed or solved the problems that have arisen.  They would not have tracked the bubble which was, in fact, an indirect or perhaps even a direct result of the imbalances to which I referred.  The explosion of credit that emerged in the core of Europe after 2000 and the introduction of the euro was bound to have a differential impact on different countries given their varying economic circumstances.  Our economy simply was not in a position to withstand and should never have been exposed to that type of influx of credit in the uncontrolled manner in which it occurred.  I absolutely agree that fiscal rules alone would not have prevented the crisis.  However, that is not an argument against fiscal rules.  Rather, it is an argument that fiscal rules are not enough, that the fiscal discipline that is advocated is necessary but not sufficient.  It is certainly not a case for throwing out the rules as something that is not required.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">It is not difficult to ascertain the impetus behind this treaty.  The design of the euro currency in the early part of the last decade was incomplete and arguably flawed.  Member states thought they could have monetary union without any type of fiscal co-ordination, but there is no currency in the history of the universe that ever could survive in those types of circumstances.  Rules were set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, but they were ignored by many countries, not so much those on the so-called periphery but by France and Germany, among others.  What is now being proposed is, first, to take the rules from the shelf, dust them down and strengthen them, which is what was done last year.  The provisions contained in the treaty are the strengthened rules that were reintroduced last year.  Indeed, they are largely the same rules that have been in place since 1997, which have merely been dusted off and strengthened.  In addition, a decision was made to introduce corrective mechanisms where the rules are not applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">This is the main response the European Union has had to the crisis in the eurozone.  To reiterate, while I am of the view that it is necessary that this should be done, it is not sufficient because we have not yet addressed the macroeconomic imbalances that continue to exist.  Europe made a start on addressing those imbalances in the six-pack last year and made additional progress in this new two-pack set of regulations, but it has not done enough to address the risk that the same type of explosion of price bubbles could recur in periphery countries.  It is moving in the direction of addressing the issue, but it should be given just as much attention as is being given to fiscal discipline.  Unfortunately, that is not being done.  Nor is sufficient attention being given to the necessity for a growth strategy in Europe.  It will probably never be possible, despite what colleagues have argued, for a Keynesian, stimulus-type approach to be taken in one country within the eurozone.  It will be possible for it to be done in the eurozone as a whole, and I support that, but given the configuration of a system where there is monetary union and fiscal union, no single country will be in a position to stimulate its own economy without the co-ordination and co-operation of other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">That is not to say that Keynes is dead, as some have claimed.  Nor does it mean that neoliberalism is in the ascendant, as Deputy Clare Daly claimed, and there is no room for any other politics.  I strongly disagree with that.  However, when we have 23 essentially right-wing or centre-right Governments out of 27 in the European Union, there is a large political job to do.  One will not do that political job by cutting oneself loose from the currency or choosing not to engage in politics in Europe.  One will not succeed by abandoning any interest in whether the elections in France at the weekend, for example, will change the Government in that country.  We will not achieve our objectives by deciding not to make common cause with other Governments, whether on the left or centre-left, in other member states.  Instead we should be in Europe arguing with people, co-operating with people and making common cause with people.  There are many people elsewhere in Europe who are interested in hearing the type of debate that is taking place in this Chamber.  However, Deputy Flanagan and others are arguing that we should just look after ourselves.  He claims that is not a nationalistic position to adopt but I would contend, with respect, that he is being the very essence of a little Irelander.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">There is no future for this country on its own.  I have made the point to Sinn Féin Deputies in the past that sinn féin as a concept - ourselves alone - is ludicrous in the modern world.  We cannot solve all the major problems in the world, economic, financial and environmental, ourselves alone.  Deputy Flanagan might believe it can be done but that does not make it so.  What we must do is, for example, mutualise debt and deal with the necessity for restructuring it where countries have an overhang of debt.  I am strongly of the view that the debt must be restructured in some considerable respect.  That is a political fight in Europe.  It is a political fight with countries and institutions that do not want to see it happen.  If one believes in eurobonds and the mutualising of debt, let us go and argue for them.  Let us go and fight for them, talk to other people who might agree with us and talk to other countries in similar positions.  However, my colleagues across the House do not want that.  Instead they say we should forget about neoliberalism, that we will turn our backs and paddle our own canoe.  That will not work.  Let us be serious politicians, as I am sure my colleagues on that side of the House are.  As I said, I accept that fiscal discipline is necessary but I do not agree it is sufficient.  We must employ other economic instruments that promote growth.  The European Union has not, despite some welcome initiatives recently, been anything like as forthcoming or robust on the growth side as it has been on the fiscal discipline side.  Therefore, it is a considerable challenge to build a new strategy in Europe in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">One could ask why the new rules are being introduced.  The rules were strengthened and corrective mechanisms were put in place, but one might still ask what the treaty is about.  Again, there is much misinformation about this and perhaps genuine misunderstanding.  The treaty is about taking a different approach from simply sending the Taoiseach to Brussels to sign on the line to the new agreement, along with the leaders all of the other countries.  It proposes an additional step, whereby countries would anchor these rules in their domestic laws.  That is the difference because although the rules already are in place, the proposal is that they be agreed to in this House.  In other words, the Government does not simply agree to them when in Brussels, at some point after the referendum is passed, the Oireachtas will put them into domestic law through legislation.  The rules will not be inserted into the Constitution, although people thought that would be the case.  They will be put into law in our Parliament and the people will be asked to agree this should be done at some point in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">There has been much misinformation and misunderstanding about the rules.  For example, I refer to the notion that the corrective mechanism which would be invoked were the deficit rule, or debt brake, to be breached would be a deeply draconian regime that would be imposed on us without consultation and so on.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, intervened briefly on that point - I agree with him - because the idea that the Commission will come in as a-----</p>

          <p eId="para_997">I would not have allowed the Minister of State to interrupt me.  It was someone else he interrupted.  Of course, it is completely untrue that the corrective mechanism is the draconian regime suggested.  The obligation is that Ireland would support and implement proposals with which the Commission would come forward.  Such proposals would be country-specific, based on the particular conditions in an individual country.  Moreover, there would be a timeframe for the implementation of such proposals.  The Commission does not operate in the manner characterised by Members on the other side of the House.  There must be a high degree of consultation, as there always has been and as I believe there will be in the future.  The treaty states specifically, "Such correction mechanism shall fully respect the prerogatives of national Parliaments".  Consequently, Members will also have a responsibility in this regard.  Their role is set out clearly in the treaty and they must step up to the plate.  One might ask what this Parliament is doing about budgetary discipline.  Obviously, the Government brings forward the budget, but what responsibilities are Members, as parliamentarians, taking on?  They need to engage in self-criticism on how quickly, how carefully and in what detailed way they become involved in budgetary assessment as parliamentarians.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">On the 3% target, I again remind colleagues that Ireland is already committed in this regard.  I acknowledge Members opposite disagree with this and I certainly disagreed strongly with the decision taken in 2008 to provide the guarantee that led inevitably and inexorably to what happened last year in respect of the bailout.  However, the State has made a solemn commitment to reduce its deficit to 3% by 2015.  Moreover, the treaty provisions will not kick in for Ireland until at least 2015 because the programme of assistance will be in place until then.  It is true that Ireland would then be obliged to go further than the figure of 3%.  Were it to get out of the programme by 2015, it would be obliged to reduce the deficit further to comply with the new rules.  However, if one considers the proportionate reduction that would be needed beyond 3%, it pales somewhat when compared with what we have been asked to do and are obliged to do up to 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In respect of the debt brake, in a genuine spirit of debate I seek to discover the origin of the annual 5% reduction cited by Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, as well as the source of his figures of €2 billion or €3 billion per year.  On the reduction of the debt, Members should consider a country with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 100% - I acknowledge that Ireland's debt is somewhat higher.  As one is obliged to reduce the debt by one twentieth of the amount above 60% of GDP, in the aforementioned case one would be obliged to reduce it by one twentieth of 40%, which is 2%.  If such a country experiences growth of 2%, it is covering it.  Historically, the manner in which countries have dealt with debt and the way in which one eats into it is through growth.  One may argue that Ireland may not experience growth, but if that is the case, we will be back in the same position in 2015.  Ireland will not get out of the programme of assistance without growth.  Moreover, the European Union and the world economy will not get out of its problems without growth.  Consequently, no matter how one approaches the future, it is a given that growth is a necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">On sanctions, there is a belief abroad that the treaty states the European Court of Justice can impose sanctions on countries that do not implement the rules.  This is completely untrue.  The involvement of the European Court of Justice is confined to a circumstance in which a country has failed to put the rules into law.  A country cannot be brought to the  European Court of Justice under the treaty for breaching the rules, it can only be brought before it for failing to put the rules into law.  This point is not well understood.  People are suggesting Ireland will be brought to the court and fined unless it does this, that and the other.  However, the treaty does not provide for this.  The sanction in this regard would only apply were the referendum to be passed and Ireland then to fail to bring forward the legislation in, say, June.  That might occur, but it seems highly unlikely that were the treaty to be ratified by the people, the Government would not then proceed with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The treaty is about more than stability.  It is also about solidarity and trust between the peoples and governments of Europe.  I state to Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan and other Members that just occasionally Deputies may need to think about the perspectives of other peoples in Europe apart from thinking, as they must, about our own.  They represent the people and have a duty to them principally before anyone else.  While I accept this point, occasionally, they might think about how the world in which they live looks from the perspective of German, Finnish, Belgian or Dutch taxpayers and how they perceive what has happened.  It might be worthwhile to consider how they perceive what they have been called upon to do and why they might require a certain amount of mutual trust.  In this context, one might consider it to be not at all surprising that in response to further calls on their resources and them to vote in parliament to fund bailouts, they would seek to have people take the rules seriously by incorporating them in their own laws.  I repeat that this is all the treaty asks us to do.  It does not bring in new rules, but it commits countries to putting the existing rules into domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">As for the imbalances and all the other crucial issues that must be addressed, Deputy Mick Wallace referred to uneven development.  He is absolutely right in this regard and has put his finger on the real problem in Europe.  It is absolute necessary for the countries of the eurozone and the wider European Union to address now and in the future the question of how to deal with the fact that different countries have different levels of economic development and how to have in place a system and a strategy for growth that simply does not direct itself towards meeting the needs of the so-called core countries but that genuinely serves all the states of the European Union.  I have mentioned these are political questions of huge importance.  The outcome of the French presidential election at the weekend and the subsequent second round is of massive importance also.  These are big political questions and people are thinking about such issues in Europe.  The way to approach this issue is not to walk away and suggest the people concerned will only bring trouble to us.  I refer to the attitude that suggests it is all trouble, that we do not want it and, consequently, should vote "No".  It reminds me of the little boy holding back the flood with his finger in the dyke.  It is as though we can walk away from it and that such things will not matter to us, which is ludicrous.  I apologise, as I have tried to avoid using phraseology that sounds as though I am suggesting people are ludicrous.  However, one must be serious in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">If people are not convinced, they will be by the following point.  There is uncertainty almost everywhere one looks in the world, certainly in Europe.  Consequently, one should apply a test and balance risk.  One should ask oneself whether voting "Yes" or voting "No" is the riskier course of action.  It appears the Irish people will not take a punt on the idea that we should simply cut ourselves loose, sail out into the ocean in choppy waters, in the expectation someone will turn up to save us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">That is the sort of proposition that is being put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">I am of the view that we should remain at the heart of both the European Union and the eurozone.  We should also work hard - by means of the rules contained in the treaty and also through other instruments which need to be introduced - in order to strengthen the opportunities for growth in the European Union and those that exist for this country if it remains within the latter.  We must fight alongside those in Europe whose views are the same as ours.  We must argue in favour of our political beliefs and we must never give up.  The strongest argument in respect of this matter is, quite literally, a comparative risk analysis.  In other words, we must ask which course of action is more risky or uncertain.  If people apply a basic, rational level of thought to this matter, then it is obvious that there is only one way to vote.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_1008">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  This is one of the most important items of legislation to come before the House each year.  I understand the importance of allowing Members to have their say on what is happening in the area of social welfare, especially in the context of protecting the more vulnerable in society, such as pensioners and others.  In light of the difficult times in which we live, prior to the budget everyone was concerned that the Government, which is under severe pressure, would be in a position to protect the old, the vulnerable and the many people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits or pensions.  The Government faced a particular challenge in coming up with ways of achieving its goal in this regard, namely, maintaining existing social welfare rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">As it introduces austerity measures to try to reduce the budget deficit in the coming years, the Government is going to face another major challenge.  I am pleased the Minister is present because I wish to put it to her that when difficulties arise in the period ahead in the context of trying to find money to pay pensioners, there is one area on which she must focus.  This area has been neglected by successive Ministers but there has never been a more opportune time to take action in respect of it.  I refer, of course, to social welfare fraud.  I represent a rural constituency and I have heard some unbelievable stories about fraud of this kind.  The Minister has a great opportunity - probably better than those which presented themselves to any of her predecessors - to take up the challenge in this regard, particularly as the people are on her side.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Social welfare fraud is having a major effect on the economy.  I have been informed by people who want to obtain legitimate employment or to establish businesses in the area of construction or whatever that they cannot compete with those who are operating in the black economy.  It is not popular for someone who represents a rural constituency, where a small and open local economy exists and where people are used to getting work done for the lowest price, to say this.  However, the truth is that the Minister must tackle the problem of social welfare fraud because it is creating major difficulties for those who want to establish businesses and create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I must be careful with regard to how I frame my next point.  I understand that non-nationals are engaging in major abuses of the social welfare system, particularly those who fly into the country to claim benefits and who then fly out again.  The Minister needs to put together a team of investigators to examine the position in this regard.  We will never have enough money to pay benefits to genuine claimants if those who are engaging in fraud are not dealt with.  I do not wish to tar all of those to whom I refer with the same brush.  However, I have been informed about people who are working in other countries and who fly into Ireland to claim social welfare benefits.  Will the Minister indicate if the stories in this regard are true?  We have a responsibility to ensure fraud of this nature does not occur.  If necessary, people should be obliged to sign on three or four times each week to bring this type of fraud to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">There has been much discussion in this House and elsewhere with regard to wrongdoing in society.  Those who are fraudulently claiming social welfare benefits are committing a wrong against society.  I ask that in the coming months the Minister give consideration to the possibility of investigating social welfare fraud.  If it proves necessary to appoint people from other parts of the public service to the investigation teams to which I refer, this should be done.  In that context, I understand the type of pressure under which the staff of the Department of Social Protection are working at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Action must be taken to make it easier for those who are unemployed to take up training courses and return to mainstream employment.  I understand many businesses are prepared to take people on for two or three days each week.  There is no simple way of encouraging someone to work for two or three days a week, for ten days a month or whatever.  However, a large number of employers have shown a willingness to take on people who are currently on the live register on a short-term basis.  We could make matters much easier in this regard and thereby create benefits for the tourism industry, the agriculture industry and those whose businesses are seasonal in nature.  When businesses of the sort I have highlighted come under pressure at certain times each year, they should be able to liaise with their local social welfare offices or use the Internet to retain the services of individuals who are prepared to work.  A glorious opportunity exists to encourage even greater co-operation on this matter and employers' groups would certainly be prepared to put forward ideas in respect of it.  The Minister must take up the challenge that exists in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1014">I welcome the Minister and I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for sharing time.  I wish to touch on a number of different themes in respect of the Bill and to make a number of points to the Minister with regard to the social welfare system and the way it is administered.  I will focus on the Bill in the first instance, before proceeding to comment on some of the broader matters about which I am concerned.  I will begin with the changes announced by the Minister for the payments available to lone parents and their children, and specifically the time at which they cease.  As the Minister knows well, this is a very sensitive area to discuss but it is crucial to do so.  It is not the ambition of anybody in this House to deepen a person's poverty or leave people in a position where they feel they cannot look after their children.  We do not want to form a dilemma where people may have to take up a job that might not pay well - and will certainly not do so after tax is taken - and have to pay child care costs if they can find such a service.  More often than not people would have to turn down job offers because the preferred child care facilities are unavailable.  It is a very sensitive and emotive topic.  There are a number of reasons for supporting the Minister's actions and we will not make the final change to the threshold to seven years of age until there is an array of child care options available to people that the State can afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">I will discuss the trends for the number of lone parent payments paid out in comparison to other social welfare payments within the system.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has produced a very telling table detailing the number of different people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, as well as lone parent payments, over certain years.  Over the past 12 or 13 years the number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit has varied by year in response to what happens in the economy.  As we moved through the 1990s to the early part of this century the number of people in receipt of those allowances or benefits was quite low and became very low before it increased sharply.  It is telling that the number of people in receipt of different lone parent allowances was relatively unchanged across the period, regardless of the different job opportunities which existed in the economy, the conditions within the labour market or other factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">The sensitivity of that payment and the people in receipt of it in response to what happened in the rest of the economy can be compared to the different welfare payments, and it is very low.  That should provide an insight on the way the payment is currently being handled and how it was structured in the past.  It is not working in the way everybody would want, given that payments - especially like this - are more often than not intended to allow people to exit the payment system at some point if jobs or other facilities become available.  That has not happened with this payment so we should examine its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">I met different groups of people campaigning against the changes due to be made and became aware of the amount of stigma and negative social comment evidenced with that particular payment.  I am concerned about this, as are the people in receipt of the payment.  Speaking to people in the community and raising the issue of welfare fraud, a number of different areas can be given as an example.  Deputy Tom Hayes mentioned some of them.  More often than not the availability of the lone parent allowance and the way in which people access it is raised.  I know the vast majority of people in receipt of this payment meet the conditions and need it because of the circumstances of their lives.  I am also aware of a study by the Minister when she prepared the fraud action plan.  At that time a sample of different social welfare payments was investigated to ensure people in receipt of the payments met the required conditions, and just under one in three people in receipt of that payment did not meet the criteria.  That is unfair on the people who need the payment and the vast majority who are in genuine receipt of it.  It is also unfair on the people paying for it.  The kind of changes sought by the Minister, although difficult, should be supported in order to tackle issues that have been left alone for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">I will make specific points about the Bill.  There are provisions in the Bill relating to direct benefit schemes which are welcomed by people in the industry.  There are also absent provisions relating to direct benefit schemes, and over time if a lack of payments means a scheme is not viable, nearly all the funding currently available will be left to people in receipt of direct benefit pensions.  That means people who are due to receive the payment at a point in the future will be left out.  It seems the scales in this regard are weighted in favour of people receiving a pension as opposed to people who may receive the pension either soon or at a further point in the future.  I would like to see that addressed as the Bill moves through the House or in another piece of social welfare legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">Increased powers will be made available for social welfare inspectors dealing with rent supplement.  I am absolutely certain this is a significant source of fraud within the system and, more worryingly, I am certain this is a source of exploitation.  Tenants, particularly people in vulnerable positions, may be unsure of what homes they may be able to secure in the future and end up in substandard rental accommodation while in receipt of rent supplement from the State.  It is a significant collective cost for the taxpayer and these people are being exploited.  Unfortunately, I have come across examples of this in my constituency.  People are living in unacceptable accommodation but do not feel in a position to bargain as they are in receipt of rent supplement.  This Bill provides increased power and competence to social welfare inspectors so they can consider how the payment is being made, which is welcome.  I would like to see this power deployed in conjunction with local authorities so when people from the authorities are trying to ensure that private rented accommodation meets the criteria laid down in law, it can dovetail with the power required by social welfare inspectors who check the payment of rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">There is also the issue of social welfare benefits for people who were formerly self-employed.  People who worked in construction now fall into three unfortunate groups; they are people who have left the country, those who are hanging on by their fingertips and those who are unemployed.  As a result of the system of PRSI payments, those unemployed people may not be able to access a jobseeker payment, and if they can, it may be a greatly reduced payment compared to that received by many others.  When the people were working in the economy, they did not believe they could find themselves in such a position.  Many of them did not understand that if they became unemployed, the level of welfare benefit they would receive would be far lower than that received by people who were not self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I know the Minister has indicated she will examine the matter during her term in office.  We must consider how to overhaul the PRSI system so people who are self-employed can, first, understand the implications of becoming unemployed.  We should also provide more options to allow people to make payments into the system in order that those who subsequently find themselves unemployed are able to access higher welfare payments than are available at present and are in a position to meet their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">A debate is taking place on the implementation of a proposal for a single working age payment.  The Minister recently convened a seminar in her Department on the issue.  It was also the subject of a recent report by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, for which Deputy Ó Snodaigh acted as rapporteur.  I had an opportunity to read the committee's excellent report, which proposes moving from a social welfare system with many different payments, each of which has different conditions attached, towards one in which a much smaller number of payments would be made available at different points in people's lives, depending on age and needs.  The Government is committed to carrying out the necessary review as part of the memorandum of understanding.  Implementation of this proposal would make a significant improvement to the current system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Many of those who are concerned about the proposed reform of the social welfare system argue it should not be undertaken until the labour market improves significantly and people can easily find a job and thus leave the social welfare system.  I urge the Minister to use the coming period to plan for the implementation of such a system in future.  Many of the difficulties we currently face, for example, the poverty trap, are the very problems people previously thought we would never face again.  These issues cropped up in books on the social welfare system written in the 1990s, but until recently we believed we had put them behind us.  Structural change to the social welfare system is needed if we are to ensure these problems do not recur.  This is a highly complex task and the debate initiated by the Minister and joint committee is very welcome for that reason.  I hope it will be followed by a period of planning which will enable us to identify what needs to be changed in the system and to build on some of the improvements being made at present.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1024">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012.  I am surprised by the changes the Minister has made to the social welfare system because they appear to amount to a concerted attack on women in particular.  An examination of her proposals shows the change to the averaging rule has made the position of  many women much worse.  I refer to women who worked for a period before leaving the workforce to rear children and returned to employment subsequently.  The Minister's change will reduce payments for many such women because they will have a contribution average lower than 48 weeks.  This is a surprising change because if I were to check the speeches the Minister made while in opposition, I suspect I will find she argued the social welfare code penalised women for being forced out of the workforce.  I have no doubt she recognises, as I did while Minister for Social Protection, that while the system was correctly based on averages in its early years, it continued to be based on averages for much too long and became inherently unfair.  I could provide her with details of cases which support that view.  For example, I encountered a case of a person who, having worked for one week when she was 22 years old, left the workforce and subsequently returned to employment many years later.  Although she accrued plenty of stamps and contribution years, her contribution average was approximately 24 because of the week she had worked when she was much younger.  If she had a right to discard that week, she would have qualified for a full pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The previous Government had started to implement a decision to move to a total contribution system.  This would have meant a person's total contributions amounting to 30 years would receive a full pension irrespective of the average contribution figure.  While the averaging system was not great when my party was in power, at least it provided that if a person's contribution average fell below 48, his or her payment would not fall over a cliff, so to speak.  The Minister's decision to penalise those who left the workforce to do the important job of caring for children or elderly people before returning to employment subsequently predominantly affects women, although I have encountered cases of men who were caught by this anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The Minister then moved on to lone parents.  I believe 90% of one-parent families are headed by women.  While many people believe single parents make up a homogenous group, they include people whose marriages have broken down, people who never married and many others.  Single parents are a wide-ranging group of people.  All the surveys indicate they experience the greatest levels of poverty and disadvantage.  For the short time I was Minister for Social Protection, an informal group consisting of pensioners, lone parents and others used to meet in the Department every six to eight weeks.  Some well-heeled pensioners, including people who had incomes of €70,000, €80,000 and €100,000 with contributory and private pensions to match, are good at making a great deal of noise.  I used to impress on the pensioners in the group that statistics show lone parents are a disadvantaged group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">When I joined the Department there was considerable evidence that creating a distance between lone parents and the workforce was not good in the long term.  I was also swayed by the arguments made by my predecessor and departmental officials that the social welfare system was deficient in not requiring those in receipt of one-parent family allowance to engage with the labour market until their youngest child was 22 years old.  The evidence showed this was not the best system, although changing it would require putting supports in place.  I recall the Labour Party being highly critical of the measures I introduced to change the system.  I also remember pointing out that under the old system, a lone parent participating in second chance education could find herself in the same university class as her child.  The idea a person would be required to baby sit a child of 20 or 21 years did not stand up to logic.  For this reason, I was in the process of progressively reducing the age at which the lone parent payment ceased.  My proposal to reduce the age to 13 years was sharply criticised by the then Labour Party spokesperson on social welfare.  During the Committee Stage debate on the relevant social welfare Bill I listened carefully to the then spokesperson and later double-checked the position to ascertain the oldest age at which children move from primary school to secondary school.  I found that if I were to raise the proposed age from 13 to 14 years, I would guarantee that every child would have jumped the bridge into secondary school where the school day is much longer.  On foot of this finding, I amended the Bill on Report Stage to make this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">As Minister, I identified the four levels of child care support needed.  It is not needed for students who have completed the leaving certificate.  Although young people of that age need contact with their parents, they do not need a parent to be home at 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m., and the chances are young people in third level education would not have returned home at that time.  While it is important parents are available when children are in secondary school, informal arrangements can be made at modest cost for children to be cared for from the time they come home from school until the time a parent returns from work.  However, I did promise that as we were introducing this over a number of years, I would act in good faith as long as I was there, but there had to be child supports and after school arrangements made, particularly in areas where there was a high concentration of lone parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">When we look at the care that a child needs when in primary school and when we look at the time at which primary schools close, we come to a completely higher level of support.  The Minister suddenly decides in the budget, at a time when the jobs are not there anyway, that we must have a whole lot of one-parent allowance recipients on the dole queue, even if they do not wish to take up employment and they want to be full-time parents.  I think that is regressive.  I do not believe that the Minister has the child care arrangements in place to cover this.  Child care costs are quite expensive, so this is negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">It is interesting that when I spoke to the various representative organisations about the change I made, I think it would be fair to say that there was a certain amount of concern.  Some of them had been supportive while some of them were concerned, but they basically agreed that it was workable in the timescale I had outlined, as long as the Department honoured the commitment in respect of after school care and so on.  It is fair to say that the reaction of these bodies is totally different this time, and a new body, SPARK, has been set up.  That group would share my concerns that the child care arrangements are not in place at an affordable cost to make this possible.  I think the Minister will be well served by withdrawing this proposal and bringing it back when she has got the agreement of the one-parent family organisations on child costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">It would be interesting to hear what a court would declare if somebody challenged the constitutionality of this on the basis of the provision in the Constitution in respect of women not being forced by economic necessity to engage in labour outside of the home, to the detriment of their children.  It is a provision in the Constitution which I would like to see updated to state "parents" rather than women, but it is one which, in spite of the derision in which it is held by many, could come to the aid of women who feel this is exactly what the Minister is trying to do.  I would be interested to see what the Supreme Court would make of a case brought by a parent of children aged seven, eight and 12 and who is being forced to take up employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">We then have to add the Minister's decision on the CE schemes to all of this.  It is fair to say that in an objective world, we should never have given the two child dependant allowances.  It should never have happened.  I am sure at the time there was probably a big row and I have no doubt the Labour Party Members were roaring at us that we were in some way being unfair to one-parent families in the CE schemes, and the double allowance came in.  I often believe that if even a thing has a flaw, it is like giving a child ice cream and then suddenly taking it away.  If the child was never given the ice cream in the first place, he might not miss it, but he will sure miss it if it is given to him and then taken away.  Many people had come to depend on this level of payment and suddenly swiping €29.80 per child per week just like that was callous and disregarding.  The Minister then moved and said that those with a disability and one-parent families could not claim the part social welfare payment and the full CE payment.  There is a lot of logic to that, except we know that again we do not have the provisions yet put in place to facilitate the one-parent family to go on the CE schemes due to the child care costs.  While it is a perfectly rational decision for children over 14 and 15 and there is no significant child care costs, especially on a 19 and a half hour week or a week on and week off basis, it is completely different when young children are involved.  Since the one-parent family payment will now be confined to those with children under seven, this was an unnecessary move because the accessibility of one-parent families to the double payment would have been seriously curtailed in its own right, and effectively over time would only have been available where children were under seven and where there were significant child care costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">It seems the Minister is very determined to make targeted changes against women.  I might also say that she joined the rest of her colleagues in the targeting of rural Ireland when she changed the means disregard for farm assist from 70% to 85%.  Ministers tell us - all the experts told us too - that if the tax rate is raised to over 60% or 65%, it becomes a complete disincentive.  Under farm assist and most of these means tested schemes, the disincentive level is now 85%.  It used to be 70%.  In other words, it is effectively a tax.  People say it is social welfare, but it is the effective thing.  The amount taken out of every euro was 70% and now it is 85%.  I did not understand any of this until I went to rural Ireland, and I was shocked to find that when I went there, they took 100% of everything earned and then they wondered why there was no incentive for a person to improve his farming situation.  The Minister is now going back to this Dickensian view of social welfare and believes that it is quite right for her to take 85 cent out of every euro earned and that there is still some incentive to get involved in self-employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">A couple came into me recently and the husband was self-employed.  The Minister's good officials will know how much I argued against all of this stuff in my short time in the Department, and regretted that I was not there for a longer period to do more about it.  Every euro he earned from self-employment will take a euro out of his jobseeker's allowance.  However, if he or his wife was in employment, the Department would disregard the first €60 and take 60% of the balance.  What have we against self-employment in this country?  What is our hatred of self-employment that for one person, we give some kind of a break - although in reality it is high taxation - but for the other, we claw back a euro from every euro?</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">In the case of the CE schemes, it is ironic that the rug of the disability payment was pulled at a time when the partial capacity allowance was being brought in, and I understand the Minister is at last progressing on that.  The idea was that people in receipt of an invalidity pension would be measured for their disability, as it were, and allowed keep a proportion of the payment, depending on the severity of their disability, and to work in the commercial economy.  While that is being done for people who have a job, manage to make contributions and be entitled to a non-means tested payment, the exact opposite is being done for people with disabilities who never had the opportunity to get a full-term commercial job and have depended on schemes.  They are being told they cannot keep any of their disablement payment even though they are working for the rest of the payment for a very low wage and there are also other costs, such as the cost of getting to and from work if they do not own their own transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">I would love to have an opportunity to talk about pensions.  I want to ask the Minister what happened to the sovereign bonds and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1038">-----the idea of having Irish pension funds invested in Irish sovereign bonds instead of invested at a much lower and inferior rate in German bonds.  Since becoming Minister, Deputy Burton will have found that a great deal of the money in the banks derives from pensions, life insurance and bonds and that it was not as simple as was made out by the Government parties in the old days to burn bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">On the matter of the mortgage interest supplement, will the Minister abolish the 30-hour rule?  It is ridiculous that a person is disqualified from mortgage interest supplement purely on the basis that the person is one of a couple or an individual who works a number of hours even if the person's income and financial situation warrants the payment. Will the Minister say to the subprime lenders, to Permanent TSB and so on, that she will pay mortgage interest supplement on an interest only basis directly to them on behalf of the customer only if they charge or apply a low interest rate and that she will not be willing to pay it if inflated interest rates are charged.  That would save her a great deal of money that she could use to good effect.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1043">I am sharing time with Deputies John Paul Phelan and Tom Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on taking the lead on this issue and making changes to the social welfare system, which is in need of mindful and urgent reform.  This reform is just the first steps on the road to recovery for social welfare.  Many more changes are needed to make the system work better and to support those people who need financial supports to survive on a day to day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I will not say what I thought of the input from the previous Deputy across the floor of the Chamber, but the previous Government has left us with a legacy of reckless overspending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">Its electioneering tactics saw social welfare payments and benefits increased significantly to gain public support, with no thought for the future and how these massive bills would be paid for by the State.  One such payment was the €1,000 early childhood payment, which was withdrawn after three years as it was simply not sustainable in the long term. Now, unfortunately, many other payments are becoming more and more unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Our annual social welfare budget is currently approximately €21 billion, and savings have to be found, as this figure will only grow, especially given our ageing population and the increasing number of people who will draw the State pension.  Compared with the population in other countries, the Irish social welfare system is generous.  Our old age pension, jobseeker's payments and child benefit payments are considerable in comparison to those of other first world countries such as those of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom. Many people in low income jobs compare their financial situations to those of their neighbours who are not working and in receipt of social welfare.  The people in low income jobs feel aggrieved that they are taking home the same -  in some cases even less - amount of money as their neighbours who are not working.  This is why it is important to promote work and above all non-dependency on social welfare.  The majority of people in this country want to work.  They have a genuine work ethic and do not want to be dependent on benefits.  We need to work to break the cycle of dependency and offer people a way forward towards becoming financially independent if they are capable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I welcome the reform of the one parent family payment and the restructuring of age limits.  This is a difficult but necessary decision, and it will bring us into line with other countries.     The one-parent family payment cost the state €1.11 billion last year and we cannot afford this bill in future.  We have been fortunate in this country; up to now, lone parents received a payment for their child up to the age of 18, or 22 if they were in full-time education.  We seem to be the exception as the situation in other countries is very different.  In Britain and Northern Ireland, lone parents are obliged to seek work when their youngest child turns seven.  Our friends in Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland support this.  It is important that these measures are phased in over time and that existing recipients will not be affected until 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">I also agree with the Minister that other supports must be in place to allow this to happen, such as allowing more people to go on CE schemes, to have proper training places and, above all, proper child care facilities.  Many single parents were very young when they became parents, and some had to give up further education and training opportunities to mind their child.  It is important that these parents are now supported to return to education or re-enter the workforce.  It is also important that they are encouraged to reach their potential and enjoy new opportunities which may have seemed beyond their reach in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">This will also have a positive influence on their children in the long run.  That is why the Minister for Social Protection has introduced new schemes such as Pathways to Work, JobBridge and plans to expand CE schemes.  We do not want to see people living in poverty and we are committed to supporting those who most need help from the State.  Parents whose entitlements to one-parent family payment cease can apply for jobseeker's allowance.  They many also be entitled to family income supplement or back to education allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">I also welcome the special provisions for people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, that the one-parent family payment will remain until the youngest child reaches 16 years, after which the child will receive a payment in his or her own right.  For those recently bereaved, the one-parent family payment will be paid for two years or until the youngest child is 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">There has been much attention in the media recently surrounding the exceptional needs payments paid out by community welfare officers.  It should be noted that the majority of these payments are made in the greater Dublin area.  In my own constituency of Dublin South Central, across three community welfare areas, €1.9 million was given out in exceptional needs payments in the first six months of 2011 by the Department of Social Protection.  This figure included €22,617 on buggies and prams, €211,193 on communion and confirmation and €211,193 on adult clothing.  I reared five children and I used the same pram and the same cot for all five of them.  I do not understand how in Dublin South Central, the constituency with the largest number of single parent families, every time a new baby is born, a new pram is bought.  I accept that people often need a helping hand when unexpected expenses arise but the exceptional needs payments are now seen by many as simply another allowance.  This is where change and reform is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">I also support the idea of a single social welfare payment, which the Minister has already spoken about, that would target the individual needs of the unemployed and those in financial distress.  I am fully aware of the difficulties facing many people in my own constituency because of the downturn in the economy.  Many have huge personal debt because they have lost their jobs or are in negative equity.  For these people, this is their first encounter with the social welfare system and they want to get out of it as soon as they can.  We must support these people and help them get back on their feet.  The bottom line is that social welfare is not designed as a long-term solution, except in a small number of cases, where people are not capable of work or training, and have no other source of income.  We need to continue to reform the system and not commit another generation of young people to a life of dependency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">I recently made representations to the city council for a number of people I have on a housing list.  I noted to my horror that 37 flats are available in a flat complex in the inner city.  The housing officer told me the flats are ready to go but no one will move into them.  I am continuously meeting people at my clinics who are looking for houses but who will not move into flats.  I am regularly meeting young parents with up to four children who do not want to be housed in a flat, who only want to be housed in a house.  Many young people where I live, however, bought properties that are now worth less than half what they paid.  They are disillusioned with the social welfare situation where they are in negative equity while someone they went to school with has a house with a very small rent.  This must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I have worked all my life in my parish and my community and I constantly fear the young people I meet on a daily basis will see being a single parent as the only opportunity they have when they finish school.  These first steps to reform the welfare system should be welcomed by everyone.  We must ensure the poor and those most in need of help are looked after.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomBarry" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
          <p eId="para_1056">I welcome the chance to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012.  The major issues to be dealt with are the one-parent family payment and the phased reduction of the age limit of the youngest child from 14 to seven for the purposes of the entitlement.  The Bill also extends the list of bodies authorised to use the personal public service numbers.  The rest of the Bill provides for amendments to the Pensions Act 1990.  The changes require defined benefit pension schemes to hold a risk reserve, which is only sensible, to meet funding requirements in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">The rule on the lone parent allowance scheme is quite clear: the applicant must not be living with a spouse, a civil partner or cohabiting.  This is where it all breaks down.  The cohabiting element of this has been forgotten.  This part of the scheme is being abused left, right and centre.  Unfortunately it has become difficult to tease out who is genuine and who is not.  Once a person gets the entitlement, a suite of allowances with a financial value are also provided.  Apart from the €188 per week and €29.80 per qualifying child, there is the fuel allowance, rent supplement, medical card, family income supplement, back to education allowance and a half a dozen more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Essentially, however, the burden of proof needs to be moved.  I have spoken with social welfare officers and they are very frustrated by this.  They know people are not adhering to the rules of the scheme but they cannot prove it because it is very difficult to prove.  They need more people to tackle this situation and I am glad the Bill will give them more powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">I do not believe the report that stated fraud levels were between 2% and 4% as I believe they are much higher than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">That is not to take away from the genuine claimant who needs social welfare and for whom it is designed, but to identify these people.  The people who are not complying with the rules of the scheme are not only disenfranchising the taxpayer but also the people who actually need this money.  Disincentives to fraud will also help to reduce the long waiting lists.  The people who need to get onto social welfare schemes are being hindered by the amount of incorrect applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Social welfare is not meant to be a disincentive to work.  It is meant to tide people over until they get into the workforce again.  The problem, however, is that there has not been an exit strategy for them.  We know all about getting onto social welfare but I do not see a great deal being written about getting off it.  It is desperate, because when people get into the routine of taking these payments they become entitlements.  Their mindset is that they are entitled to the payment.  However, we are also entitled to get up and work.  This country needs people to work at present so we need to work our way out of this system.  One thing is certain - we will not get out of this economic mess by sitting down.  The entire system needs to change and people must comply with the schemes as they were originally  drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The jobseeker's benefit, as I have seen in my work, does not help people who want to get off it fast for periodical work.  If there is a job available for somebody for four weeks and if it takes eight weeks to get back on the benefit, it will not be worthwhile for the person to leave the social welfare system.  That is not the fault of the recipient.  We need to introduce measures whereby people can sign on and sign off quickly.  In this age of computers and information technology, it should be quite simple.  It is an absolute disgrace that this is not allowed because people want to get back to work.  The rules of the scheme state that one must be available and genuinely, actively looking for work.  Some people are not genuinely seeking work and they should be removed from the system.  As with the housing system, if one is offered work a certain number of times and one refuses it, one should be told one's payments will reduce.  I find myself doing all sorts of work in my job and that is fine.  One just adapts to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">What really got me thinking about this was an e-mail I received from a constituent.  It struck home.  Her husband is working and getting a reasonably good wage.  They have quite a large mortgage and as they cannot afford a child-minder she is at home minding her children, and is delighted to do it.  She says in the e-mail that they did all the right and sensible things: "We got married, bought a house, had beautiful children, and thank God for that, but we are being punished."  She concludes by saying: "We were standing outside our house the other day and there is a family in the house across the road.  They are on social welfare and the Government is paying for them to live in the same house as we have.  Their medical expenses are paid and they have all the other benefits.  We thought that if we got separated and I got a house with the children, how much better off would we be?  How sad is that?"  The system is also hurting people who genuinely wish to comply, be good citizens, to work hard and stick with it, because they see it as a two tier society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Our taxes are funding the social welfare scheme, and it is fundamental that our taxes be spent properly.  Most people would agree with that.  With regard to the mortgage problems I mentioned, it is worth noting that the Keane report has done considerable work on mortgages.  I have spent quite an amount of time on this with our pillar banks and solutions will be forthcoming, possibly as early as this summer, for people in arrears or on interest-only payments or in pre-arrears.  Pre-arrears was a new word for me.  It means they are struggling to meet the payments and are barely hanging on.  Hopefully, there will be some interesting developments in this area in the next few months which will help many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I smiled when I heard Deputy Catherine Byrne refer to the new buggies being distributed and so forth.  My children range in age from 12 to three years, which is a number of years, but we have had the same buggy for all of them.  In fact, the tyres on it are worn.  The last boy is three years old so he will no longer need it.  I doubt that many people on social welfare would have buggy tyres as worn as ours.  It is because we do not like waste; I cannot stand waste and have never put up with it.  However, when something is given and no value is put on it, waste is a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">On the issue of sharing PPS numbers, this is absolutely correct and should always have been the case.  I would go further and suggest that we should consider the use of biometric data.  If one has nothing to hide, one should have no worries about this.  Biometric authentication techniques such as retinal scanning is used by many employers on their employees.  It would ensure that people claiming social welfare are the people who should be claiming it.  It is a way of verifying their identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">When I first canvassed for election to the council a number of years ago, I did not know a great deal about the social welfare system.  It was late at night when we reached a house for our last call.  We were met by a lovely girl who had two children.  She told me she wanted the house across the road.  When I asked her what she meant, she told me that she had met somebody and wanted to increase the size of her family but the house was not big enough.  "I want that one across the road", she said.  She went on to tell me that the plumber had not called to fix the shower even though it had been damaged for quite some time.  The conversation went on for quite some time.  The girl who was canvassing with me had bought a house in the same estate and was listening attentively.  However, it turned out that the person we were talking to was getting married, which was fair enough, but they were off to Las Vegas for it.  I have never been to America.  Social welfare schemes are not meant to pay for flights to Las Vegas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">In conclusion, this Government is doing much good work in this area.  The Pathways to Work document is a fine piece of work while the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is a seminal document.  In time, as it works its way through each year, people will realise that this Government is really putting jobs at the centre of everything.  If we can create enough jobs and work towards growth, we will be able to tackle many of the problems in social welfare along the way.  We should not forget the entrepreneurs whose businesses fail.  They have nothing when they fail; there is no handout for them.  They are broke.  We must address this issue.  If we wish to encourage new business and entrepreneurial spirit, we must ensure there is a safety net for those people.  They are good citizens as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">I support the Bill.  It opens up a very sensitive area in our society but one that must be discussed thoroughly and fairly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_1070">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Sinn Féin will oppose the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  There are two parts to the Bill, one of which deals with pensions.  Overall, that part would be welcome but the fact that its provisions are tied to changes in the Bill to the one parent family payment means my party will oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Burton, that seven years of age is far too low to cut the payment.  However, what age does the Minister consider acceptable for a child not to have access to adequate child care?  If the Minister believes this, why does the provision still remain in section 4?  The simple solution is to remove it with immediate effect.  This morning the Tánaiste spoke about reform of the social welfare system.  This Bill is not about reform.  It simply seeks to attack not only lone parents but also the children of lone parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">There appears to be some confusion and inconsistency within the Labour Party.  Less than two years ago, the Fianna Fáil Government reduced the cut-off age for lone parent payments to 14 years.  Along with Sinn Féin, the Labour Party objected to this, on the grounds that the necessary supports and services were not in place.  Deputy Róisín Shortall outlined the Labour Party position:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1073">The problem is that the Bill is not about activation.  It is about cutbacks and the optics of doing something about long-term welfare recipients.  How can one call it activation when, in the first instance, there are so few jobs of any description available.  That is the big issue.  The jobs just aren't there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I find myself in agreement with most of what Deputy Shortall had to say on that occasion of the introduction of the legislation by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  That reality has not changed, but now a Labour Party Minister is dropping the cut-off age further to just seven years.  Where do they think these seven year olds will go after school?  Out-of-school child care provision is practically non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">We are emerging from a decade of child protection scandals but the Government parties have learnt little.  The Government clearly believes that a child does not need parental care and supervision beyond the age of seven.  The arguments being made are that this will cut the expense of the social welfare bill.  Realistically, how will it do this?  These measures will ensure that people who have part-time jobs will be forced into full-time employment.  Unfortunately, these full-time jobs do not exist.  There are not 90,000 full-time jobs available over the next three years.  Lone parents who are now in part-time employment want to ensure they remain there.  They want to support their families as best they can.  They want to both earn and learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I have been appalled by the comment that becoming a lone parent is a lifestyle choice.  I assure the Minister and others that becoming a lone parent is not a lifestyle choice.  More than 35% of lone parents are in that situation due to the fact that their relationship or marriage has broken down.  This country, unlike others, does not impose a statutory maintenance system.  This is a huge mistake which needs to be addressed immediately.  There is legislation in place that would ensure that the maintenance recovery unit could collect money and that people who abandon their children would be liable to pay their way.  This, of course, has not been done.  Instead, the Government has taken the decision to attack lone parents and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The Bill follows in the wake of the 2012 budget which was a targeted attack on lone parents.  It made cuts to their earnings disregards, payments while on CE schemes and qualified child payments.  The cuts to back-to-school allowance, rent supplement and fuel allowance also have a disproportionate impact on the children of lone parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">A 2011 report published by the UCD school of social justice demonstrates that even during the so-called boom years after-school child care provision remained sparse.  The report states that between 2002 and 2007 the proportion of households using non-parental child care for pre-school children increased from 42% to 48% whereas the comparable proportion for primary school children remained unchanged at 25%.  If anything, as the recession deepens the availability and affordability of these services is getting worse, not better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">The Government is continuing the policies and ideals of the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  I expected more from Labour.  These attacks on lone parents are due to the fact the Government presumes they will not fight back.  I can assure the Minister that she is wrong.  The Bill reveals the attitude of the Government to the most vulnerable and least well off in our society.  Reports have recognised, time after time, that lone parents are the most disadvantaged in our society.  It is a disgrace that the Government continues to target them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Likewise, we are resolutely opposed to the cut to jobseeker's benefit contained in the Bill.  The affected jobseekers have had their hours reduced as a consequence of the recession but the Minister is blaming them for their predicament.  She claims they are nervous about entering the world of full-time work, despite economists of all colours unanimously agreeing that any growth in full-time job opportunities is a long way off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">It is not good enough for the Minister to say she will not proceed with this provision if she does not get a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of such a service.  I see no sunset clause in the Bill, because there is none.  There is nothing to suggest the Minister will not proceed with these changes.  Unless the Minister can guarantee that such supports are in place she should not proceed with the relevant provisions in any shape or form.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
          <p eId="para_1082">I am disappointed by some of the inflammatory language used on both sides of the House.  Anyone who would suggest that those on social welfare benefit are in receipt of a suite of allowances should check his or her language.  Anyone who recommends the introduction of biometric scanning should have that costed.  We have 450,000 people on the live register and I would like to see how much biometric scanning of that number of people would cost and where we would find the finance for it.  This is a particularly insulting suggestion for those who are going through the turmoil of unemployment.  To suggest that there are not enough activation measures is to assume the Pathways to Work document was never launched and is not in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">Some of the challenges in the social welfare budget are stark.  While 450,000 people now depend on social welfare, the Minister was required to take more than €300 million out of the social welfare budget.  She has achieved a minor miracle in taking that amount of money out of the social welfare budget while keeping the basic rate of social welfare untouched.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Further reforms will be needed.  We will shortly be looking at next year's budget and at how we can target child benefit in order to focus on lower income families.  We must tackle the issues of employer's sick pay, social welfare for the self-employed and other initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I congratulate the groups that have campaigned on the lone parents issue in the last number of months.  I met some of them yesterday.  It is encouraging that a group of people who were once so derided and were the recipients of politicians' scorn are now so articulate and empowered to fight their corner.  Whenever I raised this issue with the Minister in the last number of months, as Labour Deputies such as Deputy Ciara Conway and others have also done, I have felt nothing but a sense of compassion and respect from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">My colleague, Councillor Jane Horgan-Jones, proposed a motion on this issue on behalf of the Dublin North-Central constituency council at the Labour Party Conference last weekend.  The motion pointed out that 18% of all families are now lone parent families, that lone parents are more likely than any other social group to be living in consistent poverty and that children living in lone parent families are experiencing deprivation and poverty more than any other demographic.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that when the impact of taxes, benefits and child care costs are combined the financial incentive for lone parents with young children to take up employment is lower in Ireland than in any other OECD country.  The motion also asked the conference to note that lone parent families are headed predominantly, although not exclusively, by women, and that this issue is therefore intrinsically linked to the struggle for gender equality in society.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that the single biggest barrier to the labour market for lone parents is the availability and affordability of child care, as mentioned in the 2009 ESRI report on female participation in the Irish labour market.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that lone parents of both genders often experience difficulty in accessing work, education and training opportunities because of a lack of good quality affordable child care and after-school care.  The Dublin North-Central constituency council was asking the Minister to refrain from imposing any further cuts to benefits for lone parent families and to address the issue of child care.  I am glad to say that is exactly what she has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Many of those who have campaigned against this measure have said seven years is too young.  The Minister agrees with that.  She has said she will proceed with the measure to reduce the upper age limit to seven years only in the event that a credible pathway to the delivery of such a system of child care is in place by the end of this year.  If that is not forthcoming the measure will not proceed.  This is a Minister who listens and who understands the social welfare system and the nature of unemployment and child poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">All sides of this Parliament must launch a war on child poverty.   The one issue we have consistently failed to tackle effectively in recent years is creeping child poverty, which is deepening and getting worse.  It is something on which we must launch a war. The Minister understands the position, which is why I commend her for her clarification on payments to lone parents.  I caution all sides of the House to avoid the inflammatory language being used in the debate.  Those in receipt of social welfare payments desperately need the payment and deserve greater leadership from Deputies in the Chamber.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1089">In her statement to the House last night the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, highlighted the fact that despite improvements to the one-parent family payment in recent years, a large proportion of lone parents and their children still experienced poverty.  I can vouch for that statement, as every week I meet many lone parents struggling to meet basic household expenses such as the cost of food and heat.  That has always been the case for lone parents who have been given just enough financial support to get by.  However, they need more than this.  They need structural supports and engagement in order to provide a better quality of life for themselves and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">In Galway last Saturday I spoke about how the social protection system, as constructed by successive Governments, was passive and allowed many people to drift into long-term unemployment.  Previous Governments did not seem to care how they felt, having been cut adrift, disenfranchised and stripped of self-esteem and self-worth.  The system had let them down.  The system, as inherited by the Government, has also let down lone parents by failing to provide a mechanism whereby they can engage in training opportunities and re-enter the workforce.  Many lone parents whom I have met, including many whose children are fully grown, regret the lack of opportunities afforded to them as they were raising their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The changes in the Bill to the one-parent family payment which will ensure that from 2014 new recipients of the one-parent family payment will receive it until their youngest child reaches seven years of age have caused concern.  I accept that seven years is too young an age for a child to be left without adequate child care facilities if his or her parent has to return to work.  That is why we need safe, affordable and accessible child care arrangements to be made before lowering the age requirement.  I was heartened to hear the Minister speak about a multi-departmental approach involving the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills, aimed at providing affordable and accessible child care services for lone parents.  I fully support the adoption of this approach, as I strongly believe that if accessible and affordable child care services are not in place by 2014, the proposed change from ten years to seven should be deferred until such time as appropriate child care facilities are available.  That will not be easy and it will require cross-departmental co-ordination, political will and creative thinking.  Perhaps the use of rooms in primary schools as potential locations for child care facilities could be an option to be explored with the Minister for Education and Skills.  There would be advantages to accommodating child care services in the same premises in which the children in question are schooled in the morning and early afternoon.  Parents would not have to worry about transporting children from school to another location which would cut down on costs, worry and hassle.  I accept this would require further engagement with and flexibility on the part of the Department of Education and Skills, but I hope all Cabinet Ministers will do their utmost to support the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, as she moves the social protection system in a more progressive direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">The Bill could be one of the most influential pieces of social welfare legislation in the history of the State if it results in better outcomes for single-parent families.  That is the objective of the Minister in making changes to one-parent family supports.  It is not easy to change the ethos of an entire system, one which was handed over to the Government in such a state of disrepair and neglect.  The Opposition, in its quest for populist headline grabbing, is intent on muddying the waters and focusing on the aspect of cost alone.  It does not see an opportunity to introduce reform in anything.  It seems to believe that blindly increasing all thresholds is the answer to all the problems in the social protection system.  As usual, it is wrong and misguided; it is misrepresenting the complexity of the issue for the public.  What the country needs is structural change in the social protection system.  People need to be helped up, not a hand-out.  The best way out of poverty is through a return to paid employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">I am encouraged by how the Minister has consistently linked her vision for the Department of Social Protection with making social welfare recipients job-ready when opportunities arise.  Lone parents will not be left behind.  I accept that the provision of adequate child care is critical.  I call on relevant Departments and Ministers, in particular the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to support the Minister in assuring people that there is a child care plan which will be in put in place and that the Government will be remembered for how it supported lone parents in a way they had never been supported previously and delivered the outcomes required by all, including lone parents.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_430">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1094">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the Bill.  I was amused by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív's expression of horror, shock and surprise at the things the Minister was allegedly setting out to do to decimate the entire welfare system, leaving people high and dry, suffering and in poverty.  Creating confusion for the people in looking for Dingle is one thing; adding a "v" to the Irish alphabet is another, but pretending not to know about how we arrived at our current position is stretching the imagination, even for some of those on the far side of the House.  We should always remember that those in receipt of social welfare payments do not become eligible for such payments deliberately.  There is a popular myth that people deliberately wish to be unemployed and apply for a social welfare payment.  That is not so.  I am amazed at the experiences in other parts of the country because – I speak as a former incumbent of the Department – I have not seen the evidence of the ready availability of payments that others have seen and it is not because I do not engage with my constituents, because I do.  There is great folklore, as well as a great many urban and rural myths, most of which are grossly inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">One of the issues that has created a serious problem in terms of the burden placed on the social welfare system is the lack of housing.  The previous Administration decided to dismantle the housing system over a period of many years.  There was a time when people on low to middle incomes could rely on the availability of local authority houses as starter homes.  They paid differential rent which gave them security.  It was a simple system which worked very well and small and large families were accommodated.  Then a change was introduced.  The powers-that-be decided that there would be no more local authority houses built, or if there were, they would be difficult to obtain.  As a result we have reached a point where there are approximately 100,000 families on local authority housing lists.  A further 10,000 families have not been allowed onto the lists because of the intricate application forms that have been filled in.  As a result, those who find themselves in such a predicament are vulnerable.  When they receive their social welfare payments and having paid their rent, there is very little left.  I have dealt with as many such cases as anyone else in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The Minister is in a difficult position and I have the utmost sympathy for her.  There was a splurge of spending that continued uninterrupted for 15 years, during which time elections were bought on a regular basis by the amount of money that could be forked out beforehand.  I recall one election where cheques appeared to every parent in the country in respect of child benefit in order to sweeten the electorate for the election.  Such nonsense has eventually come home to roost and has created awful problems.  It has created problems for those who now must take responsibility to ensure there is some payment available to those who find themselves in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">In all the cases I have dealt with over the years, single parents themselves want to go to work.  They do not need any encouragement.  They wish to have independence and the independence of a job is all they require.  They want to go back to education and try to do so, and in most cases they do.  However, the position is getting tighter now and it is more difficult to do that.  I have the utmost sympathy for those who find themselves in that particularly difficult position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">In times of significant financial stringency and stress, the tendency is for everybody to look around and say everybody else must suffer.  He or she must cut, the person to whom they are speaking must cut, and everybody else must suffer a little more.  That is fine, and I understand it.  That is a human reaction.  However, there are those who are extremely vulnerable in society at present who must watch every cent.  No doubt there are those who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment who are in the same position and we must accept that, but the financial situation and the situation in respect of resources that must be spread wider and thinner is the problem.  There will be such a situation until such time as there is some kind of economic recovery in terms of growth and a return to better times.  All we can do in the meantime is hold out the hand of friendship and the sympathetic ear and be there to recognise and examine the cases for those who find themselves in a difficult position.  There is no sense whatever in giving the impression we do not hear their voices, which is a dangerous place to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Those of us who were here in past stringent times learned a great deal during that period.  What we learned most was the need to keep society on board.  We need, in particular, to keep the vulnerable in society on board and to indicate clearly that we understand their position and do not enjoy a situation whereby persons receive reductions in their payments.  By and large, I can understand the kind of measures the Minister has to take and I accept them.  A short simple answer is, there is no money.  That is a sad situation.  That did not come about over one year's negligence.  It came about over several years' continuation in the same direction with the result  the economy has imploded and now, unfortunately, everybody must pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">Incidentally, somebody mentioned earlier the self-employed do not qualify for any payment.  That is not true.  In fact, Deputy Ó Cuív spoke about it.  He should know.  I recall, when I had some responsibility in that Department, changing the position so that the self-employed, instead of having to show a P45 or income details for the previous 12 months, merely had to show it for the past three, four or five weeks because it was clear the income the person received the previous year was gone and there was no sense in assessing as means against the individual what he or she had earned in the previous year, and that was done.  Lo and behold, despite the good times, those who came after decided to change that back again.  The innocence expressed on the Opposition side of the House a few minutes ago about some of what is now happening is well feigned because some of those changes took place in the not so distant past when individuals on the Opposition side of the House had particular responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">I do not have time to go into the area of mortgage and rent support.  It is a significant problem at present.  It is a considerable administrative problem as well.  It is most repetitive and difficult to administer.  It is difficult to qualify for.  Rent support is brought about simply because another Department over a long number of years failed to fulfil its obligations by providing housing for those who could not provide houses for themselves out of their own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">I will finish on a matter that has caused many of us problems, that is, the difficulty now arising which some of us flagged several years ago when we saw the downturn coming in the economy and we pointed out to the then Minister that it was time to transfer more staff from other Departments into the Department of Social Protection to ensure applications were processed.  One must remember the time involved in processing applications is lengthened considerably by having to go back over the same process repeatedly, which often is what happens in almost everything those in that income bracket now must face.  That is sad, but that it is the way it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_1104">I realise full well  the Minister has a difficult job and if she is told to cut a certain amount to try to make it work, it will not be easy.  Obviously, I do not agree with the fact she is told to cut so much in the first place.  I would have rather seen the money raised through a higher increase in the tax bands for the better off.  It is unfortunate the Government has decided to cut this Department's funding so much but since it is doing so, it is a fairly impossible task not to hurt many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">There is little doubt one-parent families seem to have taken the severe brunt.  I was glad to hear the Minister is thinking of rowing back a little on it.  That is positive.  I am not one to criticise a person for changing his or her mind.  Those who cannot change their mind cannot change anything.  I hope the measures will alleviate problems for many vulnerable persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">Recently, I met two women in Wexford who asked to see me - a girl called Deirdre who had been working continuously for 14 years and a girl called Ruth who had been working continuously for ten years.  They had lost their jobs and become single mothers in a short space of time.  They told me their stories, even about accessing social welfare benefits.  It took Ruth eight months before she could get anything and she found it difficult to make progress in getting the money she thought would naturally be there for her if she ever lost her job, given she had paid tax for so long.  Deirdre is still trying to get help.  She admitted the father of the child was paying her a small sum of money and as a result, she has not been able to access the benefit.  She was told they did not believe her figures because she could not possibly be living on the small amount of money the father of the child was giving her, and that problem is still not solved.  There are so many in a difficult place today, and these are only two problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">A big problem as a result of the austerity measures implemented has been that not only have people become poorer, which is a natural result in a recession and we have come a long way down from the 2006 and 2007 levels of living standard, but also our society has grown much more unequal in that time.  It is interesting to look at comparative figures for Ireland and Europe in regard to the numbers at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is determined as having to live on less than 60% of the average income.  I studied certain graphs which demonstrated that in 2007 the percentage of the population in Ireland that was considered at risk of poverty or social exclusion was 23% whereas the European average was 20%.  In 2010 the European figure had risen by just 0.2% whereas Ireland's had risen to 29.9%, which is frightening.  Households with dependent children are even more at risk of poverty or social exclusion.  In 2007 the European average in this regard was 19.6% and the figure for Ireland was 24%, but while the European figure has remained pretty stable since then, the figure for Ireland has increased from 24% to 34%, which is also frightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Single adult households are taking the brunt of the recession in Ireland.  The percentage of such households at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2007 was 56.4% and it is now 62.7%.  In other words, 62.7% of people who live in single parent households are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is an incredible figure for a developed country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Many of the less well off have been hit by the austerity measures but, sadly, it has developed in a very uneven way.  We have seen the wealth of the top 10% grow in the past four years.  I cannot help thinking that many of the measures introduced are something of a paper exercise.  We sometimes do things that amount to false economy.  We all accept the statistics that €1 spent on a child in a developed country saves the State close to €7 before the child becomes an adult.  Therefore, it is not planning for the future to fail to take care of the young people who most need our help.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">In addition, the spending habits of those on lower incomes and on social benefits are beneficial to the domestic economy.  People on lower incomes are inclined to spend all their money - they have to - so the domestic economy suffers when they do not have the money to spend.  I would suggest 80% of the people in this country, perhaps 90%, have less money to spend now.  However, the fact people from the lower strata have been hit the most by the measures in recent budgets has exacerbated the problem for the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">I could read out the list but Members have heard it all before.  The list of areas where the less well off have been hit includes one-parent families, old people on fuel allowance, those on back-to-school and clothing allowances.  It amounts to too much unfairness.  I find it regressive.  We need to start working towards tackling the level of inequality in our society, which has to be a primary aim if we want to make this country a better place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1112">I thank the officials from the Department for the briefing on Tuesday.  That briefing is useful in helping us to understand some of the sections of what is proposed, although, clearly, the political decisions and consequences are an entirely different matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">I want to deal with the obvious issue, which is where the focus of attention has been, namely, the provisions in regard to the age where the lone parent payment will not be paid, which could apply to children as young as seven.  The Minister told us this is intended as a reforming measure.  It is essential we see the totality of the package proposed because if we do not, it is very difficult to see how it is a reforming measure.  I will not dispute the Minister's good intentions in this regard.  However, it is completely unwise to proceed with this in legislation until there is a guarantee of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">It is illegal to leave children as young as seven on their own.  In many situations where the household is headed by a lone parent, there are older children, but, even at that, it would depend on the age whether it is appropriate.  I have put down an amendment seeking the removal of this section until child care is put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">If a person is put on a jobseeker's payment he or she must be available for work.  Not only that, the person must be available for a Tús scheme, for example, or a course or any other job activation measure that has been more or less presented.  Therefore, child care needs to be provided not only for those who go to work but also to cover those who are caring for children who are below the legal age at which children can be left on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">The child care issue is hugely important and I know the Minister believes that too.  However, with respect, and maybe it is with a lot of respect, the Minister could be reshuffled into a different portfolio-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1118">It would need a crystal ball to say the Minister will argue this.  It is dangerous.  The Minister should delete this section of the Bill until child care provisions are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I listened the other night to Mr. Jim Power, the expert and chief economist who told us we were going to be in for a soft landing and who haggled with Professor Morgan Kelly about this four or five years ago.  Essentially, Mr. Power talked about lone parenthood being a lifestyle choice.  I hope we do not get back to that kind of nonsense.  One would want to have masochistic tendencies to select a lifestyle that is leading in the poverty stakes.  The one group that consistently comes out as the most at risk of poverty is households that are headed by a lone parent.  It is part of the reason I believe the Minister wants to change that.  However, let us see the total package if we are going to proceed along those lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The Government said it wants to protect the headline rates.  However, many other things are affected by the fact the headline rates are protected and, given the social welfare budget has been cut, some of them are causing serious pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">I want to ask the Minister about an issue that is not in the Bill, namely, community employment schemes, in particular the training allowance and the materials allowance.  I confess I have a vested interest since I am on the board of the County Kildare Centre for the Unemployed.  It is somewhat ironic that this is a service for the unemployed.  I do not believe these centres can continue to operate if the current situation prevails.  What is in the Bill in this regard?  Will there be any change?  Will the Minister make a note of it and come back to me?  Perhaps I will discuss the matter with her again.  I am concerned that since it is not in the Bill, there will not be an opportunity for a review.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1125">The area of domiciliary care payments is probably an administrative matter as well.  It appears a review is carried out somewhat frequently, perhaps every few years, in the case of those who qualified under the Department of Social Protection rather than under the old system administered by the health boards.  It is costing people a good deal to get the required evidence for the review.  One individual informed me that it would cost approximately €1,000 to get an expert to give her a psychological report.  It may be that €1,000 is on the high end in this case but the fact that the process costs people money raises questions.  Is a review necessary in all cases given that it depends on whether a child has a profound, mild or moderate disability?  Clearly the position will not change in certain situations.  I raise the matter because it is causing much angst and concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">I echo the point made by Deputy Wallace on the unequal society we are creating.  The Nobel prize winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, has identified that this is the scenario that prevails prior to a large crash.  If we are to reform our society and economy, at the least we should keep the imbalance and try not to make our society more unequal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">I agree with a point made by Deputy Bernard Durkan on housing.  I realise the Minister has discussed this issue previously and I have raised this matter with her in respect of my area.  I hope the Minister will be able to make a change in this area.  There are almost 100,000 individuals or families on the housing waiting list nationally but there is an unequal distribution throughout the country.  The six counties at the top of the list account for 43% of those on the housing waiting list while the bottom six counties account for 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">In most cases rent assistance is the only option.  This is a terrible poverty trap and I realise the Minister intends to do something about it.  However, it is a case of the quicker, the better because it is a Hobson's choice whether one keeps a roof over one's head or goes for a job.  For those who are out of work for a long time, most jobs on offer are at the lower end.  There is a serious poverty trap as a result.  I realise the Minister is aware of this.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to do something in the case of particular parts of the country.  Kildare North is a particular location with a problem in this regard.  All the Deputies from Kildare North have seen, daily and weekly, people being forced to move further down the county, having to take children out of school and so on.  This is a serious concern and I hope the Minister will be able to address it in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">I am aware the Minister has a difficulty and that hers is one of the big spending Departments.  The only way to deal with this constructively and to reduce the social welfare budget in a significant way is by getting people back to work.  The issues are inter-linked.  The lack of an ability to invest in initiatives that will return something to the economy and at the same time take people out of the social welfare system is a problem.  I believe we will grapple with the social welfare system year after year until we get to the heart of the problem, that is, the need for work.  I know of almost no one who receives the jobseeker's benefit or allowance who has no wish to work.  Most of these people were gainfully employed up to two or three years ago.  This demonstrates the desire of these people to work if nothing else does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">There is a great deal in the Bill, much of which relates to pensions.  There are some welcome measures to ensure a more secure pension environment.  I am somewhat concerned about the transition arrangements especially in respect of pension funds that will not survive.  What will happen to the people associated with those pension funds?  This is a serious concern which may come to the fore in the coming year.  I do not approve of some other measures in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will withdraw section 4.  Unless one has a certain imbalance, one cannot argue it represents a reforming measure.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyMcLoughlin" eId="spk_440">
          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</from>
          <p eId="para_1131">The Department of Social Protection is one of the most expensive Departments in terms of spending.  The costs for 2012 will amount to €20.5 billion.  Spending on social welfare has more than doubled in the past decade while the number of weekly welfare payment recipients has increased by the order of one and a half.  In 2000, social welfare cost €8 for every €100 generated by the country.  By 2010, this had rocketed by 100% to €16.70 for every €100 generated.  During the same period, the number of people in receipt of weekly welfare payments, who account for the bulk of the social welfare budget, increased from somewhat more than 900,000 to almost 1.38 million, a rise of 52%.  The number of one-parent family payment recipients has risen by 25% during the past decade.  The figure stood at 90,307 on 31 December 2011.  The cost of the scheme is estimated to be €1.06 billion for 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">Considering these sobering facts about the costs of social welfare, any related Bill before the House must deal with reform.  The Minister has set out such measures within the Bill and this is paramount.  For certain applicants from 3 May 2012, the maximum age limit for the youngest child for receipt of the one-parent family payment will reduce to 12 years of age.  The limit will reduce further to ten years in 2013 and to seven years in 2014.  There will be no changes for existing customers in 2013, after which revised phase-out arrangements will come into effect.  The Bill continues the special provision for recently bereaved lone parents to receive the payment for a period of up to two years.  Where domiciliary care allowance is being paid in respect of a child with a disability, the one-parent family payment will remain until the youngest child reaches 16 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Until 2011, the one-parent family payment provided long-term family support until children were 18 years of age, or 22 years in the case of those in full-time education to lone parents, without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training.  Legislation came into effect in April 2011 to reduce the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the one-parent family payment.  The changes announced in the 2012 Budget Statement and contained in the Bill continue the reforms of the one-parent family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">I understand the Minister stated last night that she would consider the area of child care in respect of these measures and I welcome this.  Consultation between Departments can ensure the relevant child care measures are in place to ensure lone parents can be supported if they are required to attend college, training or work.  Section 3 provides for an increase in the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions required to be eligible from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1136">Shared full-time posts and travel between schools is a long standing feature of the primary system. There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources. The new arrangements I announced last December are designed to address the limitations of the current arrangements and will operate from September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">Schools are being empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools.  This school led process has resulted in over 96% of the overall GAM allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">Aside from the reforms to the GAM, the allocation of resource hours for individual pupils vary from year to year. This is because of the ongoing individual assessment of pupils through the NCSE must operate on a later timescale. The new arrangements involve the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">All indications to date are that the new clustering arrangements being made by schools will have the desired effect on the ground. My Department will continue to work with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible. As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1159">The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">A Value for Money examination of small schools has been carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future.  I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities will present as a particular challenge particularly in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy and will inform how the Government approaches the outcome of the Value for Money Study.</p>

            <p eId="para_1174">Shared full-time posts and travel between schools is a long standing feature of the primary system. There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources.  The new arrangements I announced last December are designed to address the limitations of the current arrangements and will operate from September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">Schools are being empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools.  This school led process has resulted in over 96% of the overall GAM allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">Aside from the reforms to the GAM, the allocation of resource hours for individual pupils vary from year to year.  This is because of the ongoing individual assessment of pupils through the NCSE must operate on a later timescale.  The new arrangements involve the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">The indications to date are that the new clustering arrangements being made by schools will have the desired effect on the ground. My Department will continue to work with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible.  As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1179">There is significant debate around the relative importance attached to rankings criteria and on their capacity to fully capture the quality of what is on offer in higher education institutions.  The Times Higher Education World Reputation rankings are a new set of rankings in its second year and are based on reputational surveys only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">As the Deputy will be aware, the catastrophic reputational damage caused to Ireland by the inept economic management of the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party government is perhaps the most influential factor affecting Ireland's international reputation.  The current Government has embarked on a conscious strategy to improve our reputation abroad since taking office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Despite some decline, Irish universities continue to figure prominently in world rankings.  Irish institutions are featuring in the top 1% in the world.  In 2011, two Irish institutions were in the top 200 and another three in the top 400 Times Higher Education World University ranked institutions out of some 15,000 universities worldwide. Moreover, the overall performance of the Irish system was highly ranked; 17th place overall and 6th place globally relative to our GDP.</p>

            <p eId="para_1208">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">I wish to advise the Deputy that the Five Year Plan prioritises new school building projects, including the new primary and post primary schools that I announced in June 2011, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established. The Deputy will be aware of the demographic challenges that we are facing. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level. The Deputy will therefore appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, that I announced on 12 March last, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The progression of school projects to construction, as set out in the Five Year Plan, to meet future demographic demand is the main focus of the Plan. In view of the funding constraints, it is not possible to progress all projects within my Department's building programme concurrently. Accordingly, it was necessary to prioritise school building projects already progressing within architectural planning in the context of the Plan, taking into account factors such as the funding available and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs.  School building projects have not been withdrawn from the school building programme. In relation to school projects that are currently within the Department's architectural planning process but have not been included in the Five Year Plan, such projects will continue to be progressed through the various architectural planning stages up to tender stage. However, I am not in position to provide an indicative timeline for the progression of those projects to construction stage at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">The Deputy will appreciate that the announcement of the Five Year Plan represents a major change in how the school building programme is publicised. The Plan, for the first time, gives details of the schools that will progress to construction over the duration of the Plan. Those schools included in the Plan, many of which were included in previous announcements, now know when their project is likely to commence construction and they can make plans based on these timelines. Details of previous capital project announcements together with details of  projects listed in the Five Year Plan may be viewed on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and this is updated regularly.</p>

As the Deputy is aware I recently announced an initiative to replace rented prefabs in schools.

            <p eId="para_1219">One of the elements of the Croke Park Agreement is that teachers will provide an additional hour per week to facilitate a range of essential whole school activities, at the discretion of school management. The central purpose of the additional time requirement is to provide for activities such as parent-teacher meetings and school planning meetings to take place without reducing class contact/tuition time and to eliminate the current incidence of school closure arising from these activities.  Following discussions involving the Department, school management bodies and unions, a document clarifying how the additional time is to be used was forwarded to all schools for implementation. It is specifically stated in the implementation document that the additional time should be scheduled outside normal school hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_1221">The funding provided to Active Flag was €116,000 per year for the past three years.   We have allocated €80,000 to this Initiative in 2012.  Recognising the contribution of physical activity to the health and wellbeing of children and to increase the physical activity levels of school children, in 2009 the Department of Education and Skills launched the Active School Flag (ASF) to motivate and reward schools which strive to achieve a physically active and physically educated school community. The ASF aims to complement the existing PE curriculum in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">A part-time co-ordinator was appointed to the programme in 2011. A significant element of the co-ordinator's brief is to promote the ASF in schools. Specific measures to promote the programme include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1223">a mailshot to all schools aimed at promoting the programme;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1224">the attendance of the co-ordinator at conferences;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1226">a revision of the ASF website and application documents to facilitate easier application for the flag;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1227">making presentations about the ASF to teachers at education centres around the country;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1229">promoting the ASF via the HSE-funded Get Ireland Active website;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1230">presenting to final year student teachers regarding the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Since September 2009, 875 primary schools, 125 post-primary schools and 4 Youthreach Centres have registered for participation in the programme. Some 110 schools have been awarded their flags in 2010 and 2011. It is expected that another 200 schools will have been awarded an ASF by the end of this current year.  The high level of participation by schools in the programme in its first three years is indicative of the desire of teachers and schools to ensure that children are as active as possible. Active, enjoyable engagement in physical activity at a young age plays an important part in the development of habits that will contribute to good health and wellbeing in the long-term.</p>

            <p eId="para_1235">I wish to advise the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the overall number of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts available for allocation to schools this year.  10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) throughout the school year, subject to qualifying applications being received.  This figure represents a modest increase in the number of SNA posts allocated in recent years from 9,824 in 2007 to 10,442 in 2008, 10,342 in 2009 and 10,543 in 2010.  It is considered that with equitable management and distribution of these resources that there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require care support to attend school, in accordance with my Departments criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">It should also be noted that no reduction has made to the overall number of SNA or Resource Teaching posts which will be available for allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year.  This is representative of the Government's commitment to protecting services for children with special educational needs, at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1238">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department's website. However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0007/2012. The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeals Board was 23 March, 2012. The first meeting of the Appeals Board takes place this week and the Boards of Management of the applicant schools will be notified as soon as possible of the outcome of their appeal. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The final staffing position for all primary schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">A wide range of actions to improve access to third level education are being progressed through the implementation of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2008-2013). Key achievements to date include the development of access and lifelong learning plans for all higher education institutions funded by the HEA. These include plans for the continuation and development of programmes of work with young people and adults in schools and communities, particularly those in areas with high levels of socio-economic disadvantage and unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">In 2011, the core funding model for higher education institutions was developed to include a targeted access element, the allocation of which is now linked to the number of students from target access groups participating in each higher education institution.  A range of initiatives, including additional academic supports and targeted teaching and learning strategies are being developed by institutions with the aid of this funding as part of their access and lifelong learning plans.  Work has also advanced significantly on the development of broader routes of access, such as the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The principal financial support made available to students from disadvantaged areas to facilitate access to third level education continues to be the means-tested student grant. Other financial measures to support broader access and participation include the provision of the special rate of maintenance grant for students from welfare-dependent families and the availability of the Student Assistance Fund at college level to assist students in particular financial difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">From the academic year 2012/13 onwards, a number of existing scholarship schemes for higher education will be replaced with a new single scheme of bursaries based on merit but targeted specifically towards students from disadvantaged areas.  The bursary, at €2,000 per year, will be an extra support and incentive to recognise high achievement for students who are from disadvantaged families and attending DEIS schools.  Those students to whom bursaries are awarded will also be entitled to apply for student grants.</p>

Poverty is one of wide range of issues which impacts on the learning capacity of pupils and which requires interventions from a number of Government Departments and agencies.   My Department has adopted a leading role in influencing interventions to help pupils obtain the maximum benefit from education provision.  The targeting of resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage remains a key priority for my Department. DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Disadvantage, was launched in May 2005 and remains the Department of Education and Skills policy instrument to address educational disadvantage. DEIS focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years).</p>

            <p eId="para_1253">I fully acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools will be challenging for schools. However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">My Department provides some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation. The allocation process at post primary level also include an appeals mechanism which is set out in the circular 0009/2012 and is available on my Department's website. For the coming school year the existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1259">An analysis was carried out on all of the areas in which new schools are to be delivered to determine the language of instruction of the schools.

            <p eId="para_1265">A new dedicated staffing schedule will apply to DEIS Band 1 schools from September 2012, ensuring that these schools operate their entitlement to more favourable pupil teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior schools, 22:1 in vertical schools and 24:1 in senior schools under DEIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">In addition, 140 Band 1 and Band 2 schools will retain the more favourable pupil teacher ratios under previous disadvantage schemes for the 2012/13 school year.  In March, letters issued to all DEIS Band 1 and 2 schools informing them of their staffing allocation for the 2012/13 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">A range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for schools for 2012/13 including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. As the teaching allocation to schools is enrolment based, increasing or decreasing enrolment will determine whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">I wish to clarify that changes in enrolment also contribute to the number of legacy posts allocated to DEIS schools from year to year. Some DEIS schools concerned seem to be under the impression that my decision of 21st February 2012 implied that they would retain their current number of legacy posts which is based on 30th September 2010 enrolment, whereas, the staffing allocation for 2012/13 school year, including the allocation of legacy posts is based on enrolment of 30th September 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The allocation process also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in primary circular 0007/12.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">For the coming school year the existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact in a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation. The closing date for submission of appeal was 23 March, 2012.  The Staffing Appeal Board which operates independent of my Department met on 18th April and will notify schools directly.  The final staffing position for all schools at primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p>

Pathways to Work points out that at a time of reducing resources the Government is committed to maintaining the resourcing of a significant number of Training and Education places in 2012.

            <p eId="para_1278">Apprenticeship student numbers have reduced substantially in recent years and as a principle HEA seeks to have the funding follow the student,  therefore the allocation has been substantially reduced in apprenticeships to meet other areas of growing student demand.

Regional clusters will allow programmes of teaching and learning to be better planned and coordinated, resources to be used more efficiently and  more flexible student pathways and better progression opportunities to be put in place.

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1300">My Department's policy on educating children with autism is centred on an inclusive, child centred approach promoting the use of a range of autism specific interventions including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), TEACCH and PECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">Under this approach, each child can benefit from a number of different interventions to ensure the optimum individualised educational programme for him/her.  Educational intervention for children with autism needs to be child-centred and tailored to meet the needs of each child, rather than matching the needs of a child to one particular or exclusive intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">This view is informed by advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the Inspectorate.  An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA.  The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.  However, the Department does not accept — based on research, advice and best practice — that ABA should be the only intervention used.  It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children. The Deputy will be aware of the ABA pilot scheme which was funded by my Department for the past decade.  The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available.  The establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 450 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. All of the centres which participated in this scheme, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  These schools operate in line with my Department's policy.  Following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  It is my intention to continue to support this transitional process.</p>

These commitments are contingent on delivery of the required flexibilities and reforms to public service delivery. Allowances paid to teachers form only a part of the overall remit of the review.  It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to comment on any specific subset of allowances, pending the outcome of the review and its consideration by Government.

However the economic circumstances of the country are such that the staffing moratorium introduced across the public sector by the previous Government in 2009 has to be maintained.  In contrast to other parts of the public service the higher education sector has been given significant latitude within this moratorium relative to other areas of  public expenditure.  An Employment Control Framework is in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies, through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts.</p>

Due to my decision of 21st February last, to retain posts from previous disadvantage schemes in DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 primary schools, it was necessary to generate alternative savings within the primary education budget.  This has been achieved by bringing forward to this year 1.5% of the 2% reduction in overall capitation funding originally scheduled for 2013. Given the scale of our economic crisis, these necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures cannot be revisited.

            <p eId="para_1315">I welcome the publication of the Educational Research Centre (ERC) report on PISA 2009 which summarises all of the valuable research that the ERC and experts from Statistics Canada have completed on the achievement of Irish students in PISA 2009 and I note that the report confirms the analysis of the PISA 2009 data that was carried out by the ERC and Statistics Canada on behalf of the Department in 2010.  The report confirms the possible reasons that were given by the ERC to explain a portion of the decline in achievement recorded in 2009, including higher numbers of immigrants, higher numbers of students with special educational needs in mainstream classes, a drop in early school leavers, greater numbers of the students tested in Transition Year and the exceptionally low performance of students in eight schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">The additional data in this report, which suggests that student engagement with the test, as distinct from student ability, may have been an important factor in the decline, is a further piece of valuable information that helps us to understand the PISA 2009 outcomes.  The report also confirms that in Ireland, as in other countries throughout the OECD, socio-economic status is strongly correlated with educational achievement.  This is reflected in the differences recorded between student achievement in different types of second-level schools and is one of the key reasons why my Department targets additional resources on schools within the DEIS programme.  I am glad to note also that the ERC report endorses many of the actions that I included in the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy issued last July.  The detailed recommendations in the ERC report will be of great assistance to me and my Department in implementing the actions in the Strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1320">As a result of Budget 2012, Circular 70/2011 provides that teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date.  Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011.  The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.  Pending the outcome of the public service-wide review, and subject to very limited exceptions, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries appointed on or after 1 February 2012.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances.  Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.  The information sought in respect of statistical data on the number of newly qualified teachers who have emigrated following changes in the payment of allowances is not available in the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1322">Actions to improve access to third level education are being progressed through the implementation of the six-year National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2008-2013).  Key achievements to date include the development of access and lifelong learning plans in all higher education institutions funded by the Higher Education Authority. These include plans for the continuation and development of programmes of work with young people and adults in schools and communities, including those with disabilities.  Recently published data from the HEA, based on information collected by 27 higher education institutions, show that 6.4% of new entrants to higher education in 2010-11 indicated they had one or more disabilities.  This figure is a measure of the progress made in recent years, as previous estimates by Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) in 1993-94 indicated a participation rate of 0.65% of all undergraduates.  A target specific to the participation of students with disabilities included in the National Access Plan was to double the number of students with sensory, physical and multiple disabilities in higher education by 2013.  This target is related directly to the number of approvals for these categories of disabilities through the Fund for Students with Disabilities and 96% of the mid-term target (for 2010) was achieved.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities allocates funding to further and higher education institutions to provide personal and academic supports to ensure the participation and retention in education of students with disabilities.  The number of students supported by the fund has increased very substantially over recent years, rising by 200% between 2005 and 2010 (from 2,032 to 6,097 students supported).</p>

            <p eId="para_1327">Also, from time to time Missions may incur significant expenditure in relation to their premises or for upgrading of essential infrastructure.  These costs are not included in the annual administrative costs as detailed in the table as they are a charge on the overall budget of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1473">The purpose of the windfall gains provisions in sections 644AB and 649B Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, introduced by section 240 National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 and amended by section 25 Finance Act 2010, is to apply a higher 80% rate of tax to the profits or gains from land disposals where those profits or gains are attributable to a relevant planning decision by a planning authority rather than to any value attributable to the work of the landowner.   "Relevant planning decision" is defined in the provisions as meaning (i) a change in the zoning of land in a development plan or local area plan from non-development land-use, that is from agricultural, open space, recreational or amenity use or a mixture of such uses, to development land-use, that is to residential, commercial or industrial uses or a mixture of such uses, or from one development land-use to another, including a mixture of such uses, and (ii) a material contravention decision by a planning authority in relation to a development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">In the case of rezonings, the 80% rate applies where there is a disposal of land following its rezoning where that rezoning takes place on or after 30 October 2009 (the date of publication of the relevant Report Stage amendment to the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009, which as indicated earlier introduced the windfall gains provision) and in the case of material contravention decisions, the 80% rate applies where there is a disposal of land following a material contravention decision where that decision is made on or after 4 February 2010 (the publication date of the 2010 Finance Bill).</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The 80% tax rate applies in respect of disposals by individuals or companies as part of their land dealing/developing trade or as the disposal of a capital item.  It only applies to the part of the profits or gains that is attributable to the relevant planning decision.  Any part of the profits or gains that is attributable to other factors, such as construction operations on the land or the expectation that the land would be rezoned, or benefit from a material contravention decision, in the future (‘hope value') continues to be taxed at the normal income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax rates, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on the basis of the available details from corporation tax and income tax returns for 2009 and 2010, the latest year for which the necessary details are available, there is no record of any such profits or gains having been returned.  However, the Commissioners have indicated that the existing database does not include details of capital gains returned via the CG1 tax return because these are not captured in electronic format and, consequently, that if windfall profits have been returned using this medium it is not possible to centrally identify the relevant details.</p>

            <p eId="para_1478">As the Deputy is aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  I can confirm to the Deputy that both banks have achieved their 2011 targets.  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks, the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plan and meets the banks to discuss any issues of note.  The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">The overall target for lending to SMEs includes lending to the construction sector.  The Government is conscious that the construction sector, in common with other sectors, needs access to credit.  The remit of the Credit Review Office which was established to review decisions of the banks to refuse credit includes the construction sector. All loans to the construction sector are included in the construction sector lending returns. In his most recent quarterly report, the Credit Reviewer notes that whilst each banks' balance sheets have contracted during 2011, the monitoring of these figures show that no sector or geographic region has been adversely disadvantaged by each of the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1597">The Deputy will be aware that AIB, as part of its announcement of 8 March 2012 of a voluntary severance programme, stated "as required under the bank's partnership principles with IBOA, a consultation process will begin immediately with trade union representatives."  It went on to state that "AIB will not be making any further public comment until the consultation process with staff representatives is concluded."   As these discussions are continuing, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commissions, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on some of the issues raised in these questions which form part of these negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">In any of my public pronouncements on the issue, I have been at pains to point out that all parties involved in this most sensitive of issues for individuals need to be treated with utmost consideration and respect and this most certainly includes the State which has contributed in excess of €20bn to the bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">It is deeply regrettable, for all concerned, that the proposed action of shedding some 2,500 jobs has had to be taken but it is an inevitable consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system to render it fit to better serve personal and business customers throughout the economy.  The Deputy will be aware that operational matters such as service levels being provided by the bank do not form part of my remit and, accordingly, are a matter for the bank in the first instance.</p>

         if, in view of the cash flow problems caused to businesses by payment of value added tax he will consider putting in place a mechanism whereby payment of VAT to Revenue for debtors accounts not yet settled could be delayed for a reasonable period of time or until payment is received.

            <p eId="para_1601">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislative provisions for the payment of VAT as set out in the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The general position is that the VAT Directive defines a supply for VAT purposes, the time of supply and when the tax authority becomes entitled under law to claim the tax.  Section 76 of the VAT Consolidation Act requires a trader to furnish a return with the appropriate remittance to the Collector-General within 19 days of the month immediately following a taxable period but section 78 of the Act extends this period to 23 days in the case of electronic remittances and returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">Section 80 of the VAT Consolidation Act allows a VAT-registered person to opt to account for VAT by reference to the amount of money which the person receives where:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1603">the person's supplies of goods or services are almost exclusively (at least 90%) made to unregistered persons.  This would apply in practice mainly to retail outlets, public houses, restaurants, hairdressers and any similar type of business, or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1604">the person's annual turnover (exclusive of VAT) does not exceed or is not likely to exceed €1,000,000 a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">Two thirds of registered VAT traders avail of this option and therefore account for and pay VAT to Revenue only on their cash receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">In the event that exceptional or once off factors giving rise to tax payment difficulties arise for otherwise viable businesses, they are encouraged to be proactive in approaching Revenue on how those factors will be overcome and timely compliance quickly restored.  Revenue has published extensive information on its website on the matter of handling tax payment difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1727">These appointments were made to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue at a time of significant staffing reductions.  Since January 2008, Revenue staffing numbers have reduced by a net amount of 852 full time equivalent staff (-13%).  Despite the appointments set out in Tables 1 and 2, since January 2008 the numbers serving have reduced at Principal level by 39 (-26%), Assistant Principal level by 110 (-22%), at HEO/AO level by 123 (-11%) and EO/SO level by 245 (-12%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions, in line with Government policy to reduce public service numbers.  However, I recognise the need to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue while meeting the existing Employment Control Framework allocations.  I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to consider reducing Revenue's target staff numbers over a longer period of time, whilst at the same time allowing Revenue some scope to replace critical skills and experience.  This request is under consideration.  In the meantime, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the replacement of some critical posts in Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">It has been stated repeatedly that the intention of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is to return to sovereign debt markets as soon as market conditions permit.  In late January the Agency re-engaged with the bond market and extended the maturity of some €3.5 billion of debt which was due for repayment just after the end of the EU/IMF Programme.  This is a significant first step in terms of managing Ireland's post-Programme funding requirements.   The steps necessary to position the NTMA for such a return include continued progress in the reduction of the budget deficit in line with the targets agreed in the EU/IMF Programme, together with the implementation of policies that will see Ireland return to sustainable economic growth.  Of course, resolution of the wider euro area sovereign debt and banking crisis is also a critical factor. The NTMA remains in regular contact with a broad range of market participants, and conditions permitting, is seeking to gradually extend its presence in the short-term debt market before seeking to raise longer-term debt.   The NTMA will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">The Deputy should also be aware that the NTMA has reached agreement with the pensions industry on the structure of a new type of bond which will facilitate the creation of long term annuities based on the Irish Government bond yield curve.  The NTMA stands ready to provide these bonds to the pensions industry as soon as the industry is in a position to invest in them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1769">Officials in my Department have no role or statutory authority to undertake "fire safety checks" or sign off on "fire stopping" in new school buildings.  Works in connection with the design and construction of a new school building or which involve the material alteration of existing school buildings are likely to require a Fire Safety Certificate.  Responsibility for issuing this statutory approval rests with the Building Control Authority (i.e. Fire Officer) in the relevant Local Authority.  Generally a Fire Safety Certificate application is made by a Fire Safety Consultant, Architect or Engineer who is employed by the school and who is familiar with the Building Regulations and the procedure for applying for the Fire Safety Certificate.  The applicant is required to demonstrate that the development complies with the Building Regulations.  A Fire Safety Certificate is granted based on the design and information submitted.  When the building project is finished the relevant consultant is required to issue a Certificate of Compliance certifying that the building(s) has been constructed in accordance with the Fire Safety Certificate and the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Issues of health and safety are a matter for the school Board of Management (BOM).  If the BOM is aware of potential health and safety risk associated with "fire stopping", then they should contact the consultant who issued the certificate of compliance.  If they are still not satisfied then they should contact the Building Control Authority in their Local Authority.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1778">The staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year are set out in Primary Circular 0007/2012 which is available on my Department's website. This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools. The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs. There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools. The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc. Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours. The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.  All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process in the new climate of a fixed ceiling of teacher numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The Deputies will be aware that Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative in 2005.  As already announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS Band 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed, including the 38 posts from 15 non-DEIS schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">The staffing circular 0007/2012 also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation. Schools that are due to lose 3 or more posts as a result of a combination of the budget and reform measures will be able to apply to the Staffing Appeals Board with a view to seeking to have a portion of the loss in posts deferred to the 2013/14 school year.  The first meeting of the Appeals Board takes place this week and the Boards of Management of the applicant schools will be notified of the outcome of appeals as soon as possible thereafter. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until later in 2012. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1786">My priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access to undergraduate higher education courses despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances. As a result, no changes were made to the eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in Budget 2012. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.  Nevertheless, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to any maintenance payment under the Student Grant Scheme. Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level.  This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold.  The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.  Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.  Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">In addition to this, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  Also the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.  While it is regrettable that any changes need to be made to student support, I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students and allow us to maintain the high level of supports provided to undergraduate students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">As you are aware a new student contribution charge of €2,000 was introduced in higher education with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year.  This charge replaced the previous Student Services Charge (€1,500) and applies to all students who benefit under the ‘free fees' scheme.  The contribution will increase to €2,250 with effect from the 2012/13 academic year.  Conscious of financial pressures on families tax relief provisions were put in place so that second and subsequent siblings will not have to bear the full cost increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_1818">The sectors covered by the JLCs are characterised by a large number of small employments in which collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">In many of the sectors covered by JLCs there is no effective alternative mechanism by which employees and employers can engage in collective bargaining at local level on equal terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The Duffy/Walsh Report concluded that the main justification for the JLC system lies in the absence of any other fair system of determining pay and conditions of employment, beyond statutory minima, within the sectors concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 was published on 22 December 2011.  The Bill has completed Second Stage in the Dáil and is currently awaiting Committee Stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to reform the Joint Labour Committee system.  The reform of the legal framework for underpinning this system is aimed at increasing employers’ ability to retain and employ workers, particularly in sectors hard hit by the prevailing economic circumstances, including the Hotel and Catering sectors, and to facilitate necessary cross-sector adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">In addition, the Bill provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the EROs and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The fact that the process of making EROs was found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with the identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of this process, only underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the Duffy/Walsh report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">The commissioning of the independent review of the ERO and REA systems was one of the undertakings given by the last Government in the context of the EU and IMF-supported financial assistance programme for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">When enacted, this Bill, will implement the programme of reforms to the JLC/REA systems agreed by Government in July 2011. It will radically overhaul the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">The principal measures in the legislation include:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1828">JLCs will have the power to set a basic adult rate and two additional higher rates, based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1829">JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates. In order to recognise the special status of Sunday working a statutory Code of Practice will be prepared by the LRC following submissions from employers and trade unions. This Code will provide guidance to both parties in the sectors covering EROs on the compensatory arrangements, including such additional amounts as are reasonable, for Sunday working and on the procedure to apply in the event of disputes concerning the varying entitlements to Sunday working.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1830">As regard overtime, a new statutory Code of Practice on Sunday Working will be prepared by the Labour Relations Commission to provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives in sectors covered by Employment Regulation Orders, on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1831">Companies will be able to derogate from EROs in cases of financial difficulty. For this to occur, the Labour Court must satisfy itself that specified criteria have been met. Such derogation will be granted, for up to 24 months, in cases of proven economic difficulty, following consultation with the employees;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1832">In setting rates, JLCs will have to take into account a series of economic and industrial relations factors;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1833">The burden of compliance and record-keeping requirements for employers in these sectors will be reduced;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1834">Providing for Ministerial involvement in the supervision of JLCs and in the making of orders to vary or revoke EROs;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1835">Providing for use of civil remedies rather than an exclusive reliance on criminal sanctions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1836">The Constitutionality of EROs and REAs will be restored through the inclusion of robust principles and policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">From the beginning of this process I have been determined to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable workers and providing reforms that would make the systems more competitive and more flexible so as to allow the creation of jobs in these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">From an employer's perspective, the overall effect of these reforms will be to substantially reduce the burden of record-keeping and compliance.  This Bill will make the long-established minimum wage setting mechanisms fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and will eliminate rigidities that are considered to have had a negative impact on competitiveness and jobs in the affected sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I fully appreciate the concern felt in regard to the situation at the company in question.  I know that last year, some 70 full time jobs were lost at the company due to the loss of a longstanding overseas contract.  I understand that due to the company's reduced level of activity, their current business model is not viable and a decision was made late last year to close the Irish operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">Since the company's arrival in Ireland in 2002, Enterprise Ireland has made several contacts with the company in an attempt to establish a relationship and assist in the development of the business. However, the company has not, at any point, made an application for assistance to Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Specifically in 2011, Enterprise Ireland met with the company on five occasions.  Three meetings held early in 2011 were initiated by Enterprise Ireland with a view to encouraging the company to draw up a development plan involving new product research, introduction of Lean practices, building management capability, etc.  Enterprise Ireland also arranged for An Bord Bia to attend one of those meetings to explore any potential for the company through that agency.  However, the company did not progress any of the possibilities discussed at the meeting and a development plan did not materialise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">It goes without saying that Enterprise Ireland is anxious to preserve the maximum number of jobs in Castleblayney.  Enterprise Ireland has been provided with a profile of the Castleblayney facilities. It is a high care facility capable of being used in the manufacture of meals, all meat products, fish, sandwiches or salads. The profile of the facility has been circulated to a number of Enterprise Ireland clients who may be interested in expanding their cooking facilities and who have the resources to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Enterprise Ireland's Food Division is actively following up with these clients and the agency's Consumer Foods team has also offered to meet with prospective buyers in the UK identified by the company to outline the supports available to the Food Sector in Ireland.  A meeting has been scheduled for 25 April between Enterprise Ireland and Castleblayney Enterprise Centre to discuss future possibilities for the site.</p>

            <p eId="para_1846">Workers at the Lagan Brick factory in Kingscourt, Co Cavan have been involved in a protest outside the company's premises in a dispute over the decision by the company to close its operation on 15 December last with the loss of 29 jobs.  The union wanted to retain maximum employment at the plant and secure satisfactory redundancy terms for any workers that would lose their jobs. Subsequently, representatives of the company and the trade union SIPTU attended conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 10th and 16th January.  These talks were reconvened on 6 February following consideration by both sides of an examination of the trading position of the company undertaken by an independent expert.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">Following the 6th of February hearing, SIPTU stated that it would be seeking the intervention of the Labour Court in the dispute, following the failure to reach agreement in the LRC talks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">However, I understand that Lagan Brick subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the company did not intend to pursue further negotiation with worker representatives in this matter.  I understand that, in a ballot conducted on Thursday 1st March, SIPTU members in Lagan Brick voted almost unanimously to take strike action in response to the company's decision not to attend the Labour Court, and that seven days' notice of strike action was served on Lagan Brick by SIPTU on 2nd March. Official strike action began at Kingscourt on 10 March and SIPTU has signalled its intention to continue the action until a satisfactory conclusion is reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">I regret that the company has decided against pursuing a negotiated settlement and has declined to attend a Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice.</p>

The allocation of €84m in 2012 should provide for costs of ensuring 5,000 people are offered placements with community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations.  The 12-month duration on Tús is designed to ensure that the benefits of these work placements are offered to the greatest number of those eligible.

To this end, each company is required to apportion indirect elements of its corporate cost base to Tús in line with arrangements for other programmes the company delivers.  These costs will include board, legal, accounting, audit, management, including a proportion of the CEO/manager salary, stationary, insurance, communication, rents, and other office costs.  In limited cases, some element of the service fee may be used to offset the salary costs of employees assigned to work on Tús or engaged specifically for duties relating to the management of the initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_1908">I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after reaching State pension age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working will play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future.  It can be also beneficial to the individual and I am working to create the conditions where people who wish to continue working past State pension age can continue in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">Under current legislation, there are three different categories of State pensions available to older people from my Department.  The State pension (transition) is payable to people aged 65 years who have retired from work and who satisfy the necessary retirement and social insurance contributions conditions.  For those who satisfy the qualifying conditions, it is payable for 12 months until they reach age 66 years.  The State pension (transition) is being abolished with effect from 1st January 2014 with State pension age being standardised to age 66 for all.  The State pension (contributory) is payable to people aged 66 years or over who satisfy the social insurance contribution conditions required for this payment.  A person in receipt of the State pension (contributory) pension can work and earn an income (no limit) without it affecting their pension.  Equally, a person who had been getting the State pension (transition) from age 65 years up to age 66 years can, from age 66 years when they transfer to the State pension (contributory), work and earn an income (no limit) and continue to get the State pension (contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">The State pension (non-contributory) is payable to people aged 66 years or over who satisfy a means test.  In this instance, a person can earn up to €200 gross (less PRSI, superannuation and trade union subscriptions) per week in insurable employment without it affecting their pension.  Cash income from employment is assessed as part of the pensioner's means.  This earnings disregard of €200 each applies to pensioners and their spouse/partner in employment.   Any income earned in the instances outlined, may be liable for income tax and all social welfare pensions are taxable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">My Department is committed to an on-going programme of service modernisation.  A key element of this programme is to eliminate, as far as possible, all paper from the administrative process and to store, retrieve, and process records in an electronic format.  Significant progress has been made across the Department in the use of scanning technology and automated business processes which use large-scale scanning facilities are in place in the Department's headquarter buildings.  The necessary machinery and system functionality to accept and process scanned images is being extended to the Department's local office network on a phased basis.  These facilities will be used initially to assist the claim registration and client identification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">As regards the signing on process for jobseeker clients, the initial focus will be on the introduction of scanning facilities to automate the weekly declaration process for clients involved in casual/part-time work.  A scanning solution, aimed at delivering administrative efficiencies in this area, is in development at present, and the possibilities for extending scanning facilities to other areas of work , including the area mentioned by the Deputy, is kept under constant review.  In relation to the UP11 form, which is issued to people signing on by post, I would like to assure the Deputy that the processing of these forms is dealt with as a priority.  The Department is not aware of any issues in relation to staff failing to key in client details on time.  Occasionally, in individual circumstances a form may arrive late due to postal delays and in these circumstances the Department seeks to rectify the problem without delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">I can inform the Deputy that Ireland's salmon rivers are managed by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) on an individual basis, with the available surpluses (if any) of salmon calculated annually.  The annual surplus of salmon available on the River Maine is divided between the commercial and recreational anglers.  The following table is for the Deputy's information, outlining the surpluses since 2010 when the river re-opened to angling and commercial fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">I am advised by IFI that any extension to the recreational angling season would need to be based on scientific analysis of available surplus, catch returns, counter information, run timing, exploitation rates etc.  However, as I have already stated the River Maine has only reopened since 2010 and a longer time series of data may be required to support such an analysis.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2109">Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation's (ComReg) website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  The general area of Rathmore, County Kerry is covered under the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Broadband services under this Scheme are available since October 2010, from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all NBS designated areas, including Rathmore.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">In keeping with State aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is an affordable, scaleable product, which currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6Mbps download and 1.2Mbps upload subject to a maximum contention ratio.  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, the NBS service provider, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to <i> nbssupport@three.ie </i> or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">I should add that my Department also has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and feel that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at <i> nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie</i>, with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  Where a customer has unresolved problems with their NBS service, they can contact my Department, which  will then liaise with 3 personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy their service performance issues.  The combination of private investment and State interventions in broadband provision means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission’s “Digital Agenda for Europe” target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, is currently finalising its deliberations which are expected to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high speed broadband generally.  The next steps, following completion of the NGBT report, will be to bring the report to Government before consulting with the wider public for their views.  Building on the work of the Taskforce, it is my intention to publish a National Broadband Plan for Ireland later this year, which will set out a range of policy commitments and actions aimed at accelerating the rollout of high speed broadband across Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2117">Issues relating to television coverage in specific areas of the country are an operational matter for RTÉ.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTÉ to rollout a digital TV network to the same extent as the analogue TV network.  RTÉ has informed my Department that the current analogue TV network covers 98% of the population and that its new digital TV network called Saorview will also cover 98% of the population.  In addition, RTÉ is launching a new ‘free-to-air' satellite service, SAORSAT to cover the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  It is my understanding from RTÉ Networks Limited that SAORSAT is now available, which means that Ireland has a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.  Further information on SAORSAT is available on <i>www.saorview.ie</i> and also <i>www.rtenl.ie</i>.</p>

My Department has no role in the internal operations of Local Development Companies and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company as the employer, to manage.  There are 11 Local Development Companies in the catchment area referred to.  The salaries for the Chief Executive Officers of these companies ranged from just under €75,000 to some €95,000 at the end of 2011.  The average salary was some €86,000.  There have been no individual salary increases in 2012.  The employer pension contribution amounted to an additional 10% of the salary.  The data in relation to expenses are not readily available; however, I will arrange to have information relating to the programmes funded by my Department forwarded to the Deputy.  There is no Deputy Chief Executive post within the companies.</p>

Funding under this Programme may be made available to local authorities to fund major refurbishment works to dwellings with serious structural defects, for older units, and also to remediate run-down urban estates.  However, there is no provision under the Programme to make exchequer funding available for the remediation or refurbishment of private housing stock.  The independent Pyrite Panel, which I set up in September 2011, is due to report to me shortly and I will give early and careful consideration to the report and any recommendations it may contain.  I understand that Dublin City Council continues to pursue legal action to recover all losses suffered as a result of pyrite damage to its housing stock.</p>

            <p eId="para_2210">The overarching objective of the water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements that will ensure we have a world class water and wastewater infrastructure that meets all environmental and public health standards, can attract foreign direct investment and support job creation and maintenance in key sectors such as pharma-chem, IT and food and drink.  It is estimated that the programme for the installation of metering infrastructure, commencing later this year, will provide some 2,000 new jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  Further consideration has been given since then as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the functions.  The outcome of this analysis is that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">It will be a matter for Irish Water to determine the staffing and skills required for the new organisation.  The analysis underpinning the decision to establish Irish Water as an independent State owned subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Group was based solely on their capabilities to undertake the task.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">The skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.  In the initial phase, Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities.  It is envisaged that these arrangements would end in 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">The proposed public utility model represents a major change with significant implications for local government, the water industry in Ireland and its many stakeholders.  These are key issues to be addressed in developing the implementation plan for Irish Water, and will involve close co-operation with local authorities, staff and the Unions to ensure that the change is managed well.</p>

            <p eId="para_2256">On the 7 February 2012, I secured approval for the appointment of 2 Assistant Garda Commissioners, 8 Chief Superintendents and 23 Superintendents, a total of 33 appointments to senior Garda ranks.

In seeking these promotions, I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks, and to maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the strength of An Garda Síochána in all ranks on the 29 February 2012, the latest date for which figures are available, were as set out in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_2281">Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect in the current challenging economic climate and reductions in staff numbers. In that context the Courts Service has to prioritise the delivery of front line court services, in particular supporting court sittings, while at the same time providing the best possible services to court users.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the existing vacancy, coupled with other staff absences, has resulted in some delays in dealing with civil proceedings in the District Court office. The Service has indicated that measures are now being put in place to seek to address the delays and it is anticipated that all of the arrears in civil proceedings in that office will be cleared in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2284">In March 2011 the Government decided to significantly reduce the number of Office Holders for whom official transport would be provided by An Garda Síochána.  One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">In the context of the proposals considered by the Government prior to the taking of its decision, a comparison was made  between the average cost of providing Garda transport to an Office Holder under the arrangements in place at that time and the average costs associated with the provision of transport for Ministers of State in 2010.  This was the main basis on which it was estimated that potential savings of in the region of €4 million could be realised in a full year under the proposed procedures.  Moreover, account was also taken in this process of the fact that official transport requirements would only arise in the case of former Office Holders in very limited circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.  I am aware that they have led to significant savings within the Garda Vote and I also understand that overall they have considerably reduced the level of expenditure on Ministerial transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_2348">The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan both identified the requirement to address the age profile in the Defence Forces.  The key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army is under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment.  These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">I am satisfied that the existing age requirements for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force are appropriate and I do not propose to make any changes in this area at this time.</p>

The first person named indicated that he was unsure if he wanted the inspection to proceed and the following day the second person named contacted the official involved and stated that the inspection would not be allowed to proceed. This was deemed a failure to co-operate with an inspection and as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme resulted in a 100% penalty being recorded against the direct payments in 2011.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2370">I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 to 168, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">The establishment of an effective discussion group model similar to that successfully employed in the dairy sector was a key recommendation of the report of the industry-led Beef 2020 Activation Group which was set up to advise on the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  The Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) giving effect to this recommendation was devised following extensive consultation and in collaboration with all industry stakeholders.  The purpose of the Programme is to address the significant challenges to farm-level profitability by providing a financial stimulus that will encourage participants to improve the technical efficiency of their beef enterprises by focusing on the key profit drivers (such as breeding, animal health, financial and grassland management) thereby growing the overall output value of the beef sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">In common with other measures supporting primary agricultural production, the BTAP will be administered and managed by my Department.  The Programme will be delivered directly by my Department utilising facilitation services provided by Teagasc and private consultants.  The Programme is open to all applicants meeting the eligibility criteria and independent operators are free to act as facilitators provided that they hold a B.Agr.Sc. degree (Level 8), or equivalent, and have engaged in the relevant FETAC-accredited training in facilitation.  My Department does not have a contract either with the applicants or with the facilitators, who are paid directly by the applicants. Applicants are free to choose a facilitator who best suits their farming situation either from Teagasc or a private consultant.  A list of all approved facilitators is available on my Department's website.  I understand that some 55 non-Teagasc consultants have submitted applications on approximately 2,200 farmers whose eligibility is currently been examined in my Department.  No tenders were required for the operation of the Programme as outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">It is not accurate to suggest that any particular software is used to run the programme.  Participants in the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), must be members of HerdPlus, a service provided by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation which generates genetic evaluation and breeding performance data.  As the Deputy will be aware ICBF is an industry led co-operative which receives some support from my Department to assist it to maintain a national database of cattle breeding information which is of vital importance for the future development of the nation beef herd.  I am convinced that this on-going work will be of major importance in leading to the development of high quality animals which is required for the future success of the Irish beef industry, but it does not preclude the use of proprietary farm software for a range of purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">My intention is that this Programme will run over 3 years subject to funding and that it will be subject to ongoing review over that period to ensure that it is meeting its objectives.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_573">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2376">I remain fully committed to continuing to implement the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS 4) under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  The scheme, together with the Agri-environment options Scheme (AEOS), is designed to encourage farmers to go beyond basic good farming practice and to farm in a way that benefits the landscape, biodiversity and water quality.  Both schemes have proven to be very popular with Irish farmers and confirms their commitment to farming to the highest environmental standards, a commitment that fits very comfortably with the vision of smart, green, growth as set out in my Department's Food Harvest 2020 strategy statement.  There are over 45,000 participating farmers in both schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">However, despite my commitment to the agri-environment schemes, my Department was faced with a serious challenge in terms of managing a substantial reduction in budgetary resources in 2012.  While €1,312m has been provided in the Department's Vote for 2012, this represents a 19% decrease in funding compared to 2011.  Under the circumstances, I had no option but to take some very difficult decisions and to announce a reduction to REPS payments to achieve an aggregate saving of 10% on expenditure.  I decided that the most equitable means to achieve this saving, and in a manner consistent with the regulations governing the scheme, was to reduce the transaction costs of participating farmers.  These costs, which represent the cost of engaging with the scheme and which have been paid up to this point, are optional for Member States.  It is not proposed to reduce the rates for the various measures under the scheme which are calculated on the basis of actual costs incurred and income foregone by the farmer.  The proposed cut is subject to the Commission approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">I want to highlight the fact that despite the budgetary constraints and pressures that I have outlined, I have made provision of €243 million for agri-environment schemes in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2454">Historically there has been no statutory regime of professional qualification or certification for driver testers in Ireland.  The Road Safety Authority (RSA), as the agency responsible for driver testing, has therefore set its own criteria for assessing the driver testers it hires.  However, last year, in line with EU requirements, I signed Regulations which will for the first time provide a statutory regime setting standards which must be met by driver testers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 transpose into Irish law certain requirements under Directive 2006/126/EC.  These include the creation, from January 2013, of a statutory regime under which the RSA will have responsibility for ensuring that all driver testers will have to satisfy standards of professional expertise in a range of areas.  Driver testers will have to demonstrate personal driving skills and knowledge, as well as communications and teaching skills.  In addition, there will be procedures to monitor professional standards and ensure periodic training for those already qualified as driver testers.  This represents a significant change, and puts the professional qualifications and standards of driver testers on a statutory basis for the first time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">Driver testing is a function of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), and I have therefore referred the Deputy's query to that agency for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply has not been received within ten days.</p>
