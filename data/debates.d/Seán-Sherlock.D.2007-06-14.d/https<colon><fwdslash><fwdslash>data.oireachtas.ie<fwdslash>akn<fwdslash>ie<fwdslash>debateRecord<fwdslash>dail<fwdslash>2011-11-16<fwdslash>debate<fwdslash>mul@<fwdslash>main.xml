          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Thousands of students and their families are marching to Leinster House today.  Those students are deeply concerned about their future, about the Government's plans, its commitments and promises.  They need answers and they need clarity.  In advance of the general election the Tánaiste and his party made many commitments.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, brazenly went to Trinity College, four days before the election, to sign the USI pledge on fees, as did the Tánaiste.  During the election campaign the Minister, Deputy Quinn, promised to reverse the €500 increase in the student services charge.  The Labour Party was opposed, he said, to third level fees either by the front or back door.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The increase in the student contribution charge has not been reversed; in fact, the Minister will not even say whether or not it will be increased.  To do so would be an act of deep cynicism by the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_4">Does the Tánaiste agree it would be a very negative and retrograde step if the Government were to increase those charges, given the centrality of participation in third level education?  What we witnessed in the last decade was a dramatic and significant expansion of third level participation and a transformation of the research landscape.  If we are to achieve recovery we must maintain that.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The Minister, Deputy Quinn, would not comment yesterday on the third level fees issue in advance of the budget.  However, he did say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The politics of promises, if you like, in the present economic situation are such and are on a scale that I don't think any of us fully realise that no such promises can be given and any such promises would be misleading.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">He said that yesterday, yet four days before the election he could sign any pledge students put before him.  He can promise all he likes before an election but he cannot state clearly what he intends to do days in advance of a budget.</p>

I am also acutely aware of how unemployment affects families and young graduates leaving college.

          <p eId="para_21">The programme for Government commits to undertake a full review of third level funding with a view to introducing a funding system that provides third level institutions with reliable funding but which does not impact on access for students.  The Higher Education Authority submitted a report on the sustainability of the existing funding framework for higher education to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, last Monday.  The report examines the interrelationships between funding levels, the scale of growth and the maintenance of quality in the system.  The Minister is considering that report.  It will help to inform the consideration by Government of the policy options in respect of the funding of higher education.  In regard to what may or may not be in the budget and the Estimates, that has yet to be finally determined by Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">I asked the Tánaiste a simple question, namely, whether the Government intends to reverse the increase in the registration charge and to reintroduce third level fees.  A simple "Yes" or "No" would be appreciated.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, said recently that he has no regrets in regard to he pledge he signed, which was done not on behalf of the new coalition Government but on behalf of the Labour Party.  That is deeply dishonest politics.  It is deeply cynical politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Ní raibh freagra ar bith ón Tánaiste ar an cheist seo.  An aontaíonn sé go bhfuil nasc idir fáil ar oideachas agus saoirse na ndaoine?  An aontaíonn sé leis an méid a dúirt Thomas Davis, "Educate that you may be free."?  Má aontaíonn sé leis sin, an dtacaíonn sé leis an cheart bhunúsach gur cóir go mbeidh fáil ar oideachas ag gach saoránach?  Labour's election manifesto stated: "We refuse to go back to the days when only the relatively wealthy could count on going to university or when a family could only afford to send one of their children to college."  In the days before the general election the Tánaiste famously signed a pledge, pledging to oppose the reintroduction of fees.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, was photographed signing the same pledge.  Is this worth anything?  Is this just another broken promise by the Government to add to the ever-growing list?  Third level high quality education is a vital prerequisite to kick-starting economic recovery.  Access to education should also be the right of every citizen.  The existence or absence of this right is an indicator of the type of society we have.  Does the Tánaiste accept that any increase in college fees or additional cuts in student supports will ensure that third level education is not an option for thousands of young people in the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I agree that third level is very important both for the individuals who benefit from it and for our economic recovery.  That is why in the capital programme announced last week the Government has front-loaded projects that provide for the building of schools and the improvement of our education system.  The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties many families have in financing their children through education.  Some 44% of students in the State do not pay either tuition fees or registration fees because they are in receipt of grants.  The remainder of students do not pay tuition fees and there is a registration fee.  I contrast that with the situation in Northern Ireland where the Deputy's party is in government.  The student fee for a student in Queen's University is €3,837.  Given all the Deputy has said, including his quoting of Thomas Davis, with which I agree, can he explain why it is acceptable to charge a student in Belfast €3,837 and he is complaining about the student registration charged down here which is approximately half of that amount?</p>

The Government is committed to supporting education as was reflected quite clearly in the part of the budgetary process that has already been made public in which we clearly indicated our commitment to the education system through the provision of funding for additional schools to meet the needs of children for school extensions and for the capital programme in our educational system.  The Government's continuing commitment to education will be reflected in the budget.  It will be done within the constraints under which we must operate, but there can be no doubt about the Government's commitment to education and doing the very best for the education system and for our children and students given the difficult economic circumstances we have inherited.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_81">I contrast the Government's actions with its words on two issues.  When it came into power, the Government handed over political and economic clout where it should have retained it and in another area it retained political power where it should have handed it over.  It handed it over on the issue of the EU and the IMF, on which we have sacrificed our sovereignty.  However, it retained it where it promised it would hand it over, which is on the issue of political patronage.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">The promises made by both parties in power during the general election campaign about an end to cronyism completely evaporated in the programme for Government.  I do not know why they evaporated, but they did and we need an explanation.  Recent reports indicate that the spoils of war have just moved from this side of the House to the other and there has been little change.  Twenty recent appointments to semi-State bodies have been given to people closely linked to Fine Gael and Labour.  Five out of six judges have similar links and it is no coincidence.  It is also no coincidence, having been a Member of the Houses for some time, that I know an enormous number of the people who have been appointed, not because of their merit or the commercial atmosphere but because they have political connections which involve them in interactions with me and other Members of the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The system set up by the Government, which was to encourage and invite public applications for appointment to semi-State bodies, appears at this stage to be a sham because the Minister in charge has the power to make an appointment and does not have to take any notice of the applications or recommendations made to him or her.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">All of the appointments by Government to State bodies have been appointments based on merit.  The Government will continue to work to ensure we get the best possible people to participate in the work of State bodies.  Ultimately, however, the decision on appointment to State bodies and boards is a matter for Government.  The Government will exercise that power and will stand over decisions made by it in that regard.</p>

We are surprised at the degree to which the Government has been resisting our calls for a wider, more expansive debate on these very important issues and on which many Members wish to contribute.  A tendency and a pattern has been developing with regard to all the budgetary announcements.  The fiscal plan was published outside the House as was this capital programme and the comprehensive spending review will be published outside the House.  Despite all the talk of Dáil and parliamentary reform, nothing is changing in respect of these matters of such importance.

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
          <p eId="para_507">Last week I set out the Government's capital spending programme for the next five years.  It was part of a series of important announcements leading up to budget day.  It commenced with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, publishing the medium term fiscal statement on 4 November and tomorrow I will announce a series of reforms in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">As I emphasised last week when launching the capital review, the level of expenditure is based on what we can afford.  In that context, we have prioritised the investments that are most needed in our economy and in our country.  Other desirable projects will have to be put on hold until the public finances are repaired.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Our priorities as a Government are clear and are evident in the published plan.  In summary, they are jobs, schools and health care.  It is also based firmly on the fact that we are effectively at the end of a major phase of Exchequer funded capital investment.  Over the past decade, €70 billion was invested in infrastructure and the productive sector.  Judged by a range of measures, the quality and quantity of the country's stock of infrastructure has been considerably augmented in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">While the plan presents the quantum of funding available over the medium term, it is also grounded in the reality that we need to reduce spending.  Nobody in the House does not understand that.  We know that this must be an over-riding objective.  We need to reduce our deficit, regain our national sovereignty and put ourselves in a position where we have more resources available to make choices ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">However, until then, we must make some stark choices, focus on key needs and delay or cancel some projects which have been planned for some time and which we would have been delighted to go ahead with if the resources allowed.  For this reason, I am delighted that the Government is in a position to part-fund the construction of the new children's hospital with some of the proceeds from a new licensing arrangement for the national lottery which will involve an upfront payment in exchange for a longer-term licence.  I will bring the details of this proposal to Government early in the new year.  It is expected, subject to planning approval, that construction of the hospital will start in 2013 with initial enabling works to start next year.  As I already said, in the absence of this innovative approach to funding the national children's hospital, it would have been a real struggle to meet the necessary funding requirements for what most Members of the House regard as a very important national facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">This capital investment report is primarily about allocations through the public capital programme over the coming years.  In addition to this, the Government is determined to maximise the use of all available resources to promote growth and job creation.  The Government is pursuing a strategic investment strategy, which brings together a number of strands of non-traditional funding, through NewERA and the strategic investment fund to be developed into a strategic investment bank over time.  Last week the strategic investment fund announced a new fund of up to €1 billion for investment in new and existing infrastructure in this country primarily aimed at the commercial semi-state sector.  Other funds will be announced in the coming months and years.  We will also pursue the PPP approach to deliver public infrastructure alongside more traditional procurement where it makes sense and offers value for money.  Of course, I acknowledge that the private funding market for PPPs is very challenging.  Bank credit is in sort supply internationally and our sovereign debt situation presents challenges and difficulties.  I have asked my officials to actively engage with private institutional investors to see what might be possible to match our immediate funding requirements with their long-term income stream needs.  A series of meetings has been organised to progress this matter.  My officials are also in consultation with our European counterparts to explore best practice and similar initiatives in other jurisdictions.  This work is being given immediate priority in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The capital review represents the findings of a Government-wide review of infrastructure and capital investment policy led by my Department.  While I have been upfront that the level of resources available to us does not match the investment of recent years or, indeed, our ambition as a Government, it remains the case that this plan sets out a significant tranche of investment over the next five years — investment designed to facilitate economic growth and build our social infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The potential negative consequences of reduced capital spending are tempered by recent improvements in the economy's infrastructure, perhaps best illustrated by completion of the new motorway network.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Despite very difficult budgetary parameters the capital investment programme for 2012-16 will amount to approximately €17 billion.  In 2012, the allocation will be €3.9 billion, reducing to €3.3 billion in 2013 and stabilising for the remaining three years at €3.2 billion annually.  As indicated, the profile of capital spend will now see an increasing share of our scarce resources focus on and allocated to jobs, schools and health care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Creating jobs remains a top priority for Government.  A range of reforms of activation and training are in progress and the review commits major resources to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  While the need to address fiscal targets will require some reduction in the funding for research and development, we are ensuring that our direct supports to industry will be maintained in excess of pre-recession levels when total capital expenditure was, as a full quantum, at its highest.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">This will enable the IDA to deliver on its Horizon 2020 strategy, targeting the creation of 105,000 new jobs and achieving 640 investments in the years 2012 to 2014.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to support the growth and development of Irish enterprises in world markets.  Its science technology and innovation budget will increase the number of high performance start-ups supported to 95 in 2012 and includes a new fund of €10 million to attract overseas high performance start-ups.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">While the Science Foundation Ireland budget has been marginally reduced, the €156 million allocation will enable it to significantly enhance commercialisation opportunities emanating from SFI-funded research, in particular through the enhancement of the technology innovation development awards programme.  Some €27 million will be provided for the programme for research in third level institutions and will go towards research in the areas of energy, the biosciences, arts, humanities, social sciences, medicine, pharmaceuticals, food and health.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">An additional 70,000 pupils in school at primary and secondary level need to be provided.  I have, therefore, allocated €2.1 billion specifically for the delivery of an additional 40 schools and the expansion and renovation of an existing 180 schools.  This level of investment has squeezed out other possible investment in third level areas but we are in the business of prioritisation and the money must be put where it is urgently needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">In addition to our plans to develop the national children's hospital, health capital investment has been sustained, an area I was most anxious to protect.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">This review maintains existing planned levels of health capital investment into the medium term at €390 million a year or €1.95 billion over the period of the plan.  This investment will allow for the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital and the national project for radiation oncology.  For too long focus on mental health services has fallen off the table.  I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, am anxious to ensure this will not continue to be the case.  Our focus on primary health care is a key component of our strategy to deliver care locally which will take pressure off the acute hospital sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Despite investing €5 billion in improving water services in the past decade, environmental infrastructure continues to be an issue.  Consequently, alongside structural reforms to the water sector, water services investment will be a key focus of the programme.  In the years to 2016, in excess of €1.6 billion of Exchequer resources will be committed to the water services area.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Office of Public Works allocation of €500 million includes funding for the flood relief programme, the necessity of which we were reminded of only too recently.  In recent years the State has spent heavily to incentivise households and businesses to enhance energy efficiency.  We will continue a level of support in the short term and hope to find other funding mechanisms for medium-term support.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">While the motorway network is almost complete, the Government is still allocating significant funds to the transport area.  Among the main priorities over the medium term will be ensuring adequate maintenance of the national road network to protect the value of investment.  It is necessary to put on hold some of the large scale projects that had been announced previously as they are not affordable.  It is our job to ensure our public finances can be restored to allow these projects emerge in the not-too-distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The departmental envelope, however, will allow the commencement of the linking of the two LUAS lines which will incorporate a line extending to Broombridge in north-west Dublin.  The railway safety programme, replacement buses, particularly for Dublin, and the upgrade of existing quality bus corridors will also be delivered.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">Over €800 million will also be invested in programmes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, a significant increase on the programme signed off by our predecessors, bringing major economic and environmental benefits.  It is important to note the agrifood sector's contribution to the economy has been largely resilient.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">While there have been calls to continue with a high level of capital investment to give a stimulus to the economy, the need to reduce public expenditure and close the deficit is an inescapable demand on the Government.  The Government's medium-term fiscal statement sets the parameters for budgetary policy in the coming years.  As a result of this and in the context of setting the overall path of fiscal consolidation, the public capital programme has been scaled back.  However, the Government is providing for a level of funding that will not constrain the capacity of the economy to grow.  This is the normal benchmark for deciding on the appropriate level of infrastructure investment.  Between now and 2016, average public capital spending will remain broadly in line with the European average, despite the tight fiscal constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">A wide range of programmes and projects will be funded and €17 billion is still a remarkable amount of money.  The areas with an increased share of the overall capital allocation compared with the last capital review in 2010 are education, health and enterprise.  This reflects the priorities I set and those set by the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the Minister being present in the Chamber.  He has given a strong overview of where he sees the capital programme over the next five years and how jobs, schools and health care will be key and central parts of it.  This speech is not, however, connected to last week's announcement about the capital programme.  There is an element of rhetoric to the Government's claim that job creation is to the fore of its agenda.  If €1 million of capital spend supports 12 people in employment, the proposal to take €750 million, a considerable amount of money, out of the capital infrastructure spend will see direct job cuts of approximately 9,000, notwithstanding the removal of the stimulus effect such spending would have.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Minister displayed an aggressive approach to assisting with finding other sources of funding.  The programme refers to the capacity of developing a fund of €1 billion.  In other parts of the programme, however, it is made clear public private partnerships, PPPs, will not be possible.  On the one hand the Minister has created an expectation that he will be able leverage €250 million from the State pension fund to create €1 billion.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_228" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_537">Yes, but on the other hand the Minister claims there is no appetite for Government debt through PPP projects.  He has not taken an imaginative approach to dealing with each project in turn.  As such, many capital projects have been shelved.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Government has not shown little ambition in prioritising the fund for the capital programme.  The PPP model has been set aside with little effort made to attract potential international investors with the prospect of investing in a recovering economy.  The failure to put in place a credible funding mechanism to complement Exchequer funding has resulted in a complete gutting of the capital spend and all the impact that this will have with job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Looking at the basic population statistics, one knows there is a need for capital investment.  Ireland's population continues to grow rapidly with the 2011 census showing an increase of 341,000 people since 2006, an annual rise of 1.6%.  Ireland is expected to have one of the strongest population growth rates in the EU over the next several years.  While this will be a large long-term economic advantage for the country, it will undoubtedly place pressure on the State's infrastructure resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">In his various statements, the Minister has made guarded compliments of the previous Administration for the significant investments it made in rail, road, water services and so forth.  There is a clear need to continue this.  Excess activity in the construction sector in the past is regularly sited as a primary contributor the country's economic crisis.  While this is true, an often overlooked fact is that considerable construction industry expertise was built up which was capable of delivering major projects such as the interurban motorways, the Aviva Stadium, the criminal courts of justice and the National Convention Centre.  The last tranche of motorways was built at €4.5 million per kilometre which compares very favourably with European norms.  With reduced tender prices, there is an opportunity to achieve a greater volume of output.  The scaled back capital programme is bad for both short-term and long-term economic growth.  It will lead to a further drain of world-class expertise and skills from the State.  These skills will unfortunately now be put to use in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The State has already committed considerable resources to several capital projects which have now been shelved by the Government.  Up to €150 million has so far been contributed to the metro north project, €40 million to Thornton Hall prison, €35 million to the DART underground, €18 million to metro west, €4 million on extending the Luas to Lucan and €2.5 million on the M20.  Given the degree of work already done on many of these essential infrastructure projects and their potential for sustaining jobs in the short, medium and long term, it is inexplicable that the Minister and the Government have not shown greater imagination in seeking funding for these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Minister indicated it is reasonable to expect that there will be investment in infrastructural projects.  I appeal to him to do that on a project by project basis.  It is my understanding that there seems to be an appetite for that, perhaps not directly but in the next year.  Because of the crises enveloping the world there are not many other locations that do not have risk attached to them.  The medium term view from the investment community is that there will be a desire to invest in capital projects that have their own revenue-generating schemes.  It beggars belief, therefore, that the Government has shelved these major infrastructural projects that have their own capacity to generate revenue and suggested that this NewERA fund, without the appropriate information accompanying it, will be the solution to the creation of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I do not buy the Government's stance that it is serious about creating jobs.  We have not seen the effects of that.  We heard about 105,000 and 120,000 jobs in the Minister's contribution.  We heard all of that from Fine Gael in the run-in to the election.  Thankfully, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, poured cold water on the NewERA proposal because he is a realist.  He did not involve himself in the propaganda in advance of the election and he is owed a debt of gratitude for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We will have to work on a project by project basis to get people back to work.  We must look to small enterprise and stimulating activity in the economy.  This announcement does the opposite.  It puts a damper on economic activity and infrastructural investment and acts as a disincentive to investment from outside this State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_545">I thank Deputy Dooley for sharing time.  I refer to the capital infrastructural development plan and in particular this Government's commitment to the A5 dual carriageway from the Monaghan border to Derry City linking Monaghan to Donegal and to the north-west region.  We have seen in the publication of the Minister's investment plan last week a betrayal of the people of the north west in terms of a commitment given by this Government to fund that project jointly to the tune of £400 million, in conjunction with £400 million committed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as part of the St. Andrews Agreement, to build that road by 2015, a commitment confirmed by the previous Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, when he attended two North South Ministerial Council meetings.  Just eight months ago he recommitted at that meeting that the money would be spent.  Now we have a situation where the Minister and his fellow Cabinet members will travel to a meeting in Armagh the day after tomorrow following which they will try to sell to the people of the north west the message that he is now giving £50 million, the first £25 million of which he will not be given until the year in which cars should have been driving up and down the dual carriageway with the second £25 million not being provided until the year after the road was supposed to be finished.  The Minister will try to sell that to the people of the north west as a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It is rarely in generations that we get an opportunity similar to the one presented to the north-west region recently where two jurisdictions, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are willing to come together and co-fund a project that will see the north west get the same type of infrastructure that has been delivered across other main arteries in our road network in recent years.  This project could not have been contemplated until the Northern Ireland Executive was set up in 2007, the very year this agreement was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The Minister's Government must reconsider this decision.  He should have a debate on the floor of this Dáil later today or tomorrow because it is unacceptable that his Cabinet will travel to Armagh on Friday without dealing with what was a solemn commitment to the people of the north west.  He should do that on the floor of this House before he goes to Armagh to break that commitment.  I want an assurance from the Minister that that will take place either tonight or tomorrow, that he will work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure it continues to ring-fence the £400 million it had set aside for this project and that he will find a way to give the £400 million this country promised to ensure that the north west does not lose this project which will benefit future generations.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">This plan as announced will do two things.  It will lock this State into growth stagnation and will also condemn this State to many more years of very high levels of unemployment.  The Minister's Government, and I have heard his arguments about fiscal rectitude and balancing the books, much like the previous one, fundamentally misunderstands the critical role of capital investment and stimulus in respect of economic recovery, not just in terms of getting people back to work but enhancing our competitiveness and making us match fit for foreign direct investment but also for indigenous enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Instead of the kind of ambitious, thought out investment programme we require what we have seen is what my colleague, Deputy Peadar Tóibín, accurately described when the Minister announced this programme as a debt for competitiveness swap.  Vital infrastructure projects will not see the light of day and our economy will be measurably weakened.  All of that will mean a higher cost to our citizens and to business and we will continue to see a truly depressed domestic sector.  The Minister's commitments in terms of capital investment, much like the fiscal statement, resign it and us to critically high levels of unemployment for years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I will go through some of the areas the Minister has identified as critical.  Despite his trumpeting of the figure of €17 billion over a five year period next year's budget has been cut by €755 million down to a level of €3.9 billion.  That will fall further in 2013 to €3.3 billion, €3.2 billion the following year and so on.  As the Minister trumpets the figure of €17 billion it should not be lost on him, us or the general public that a substantial cutback is in play.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I turn to the matter of health.  The Minister states that close to €2 billion will be invested in health capital spending from 2012 to 2016.  The truth is that more than that needs to be done.  The health capital spend for the next four years amounts to more than €1 billion less than the annual cost to the State of the Anglo Irish Bank debt.  That is ironic, and indefensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Minister's capital programme for health is short on detail.  The commitments to fund the National Children's Hospital and to expand radiation oncology are welcome but there is very little detail of how and where——</p>

          <p eId="para_554">——vital primary care centres will be provided.  That is a long-standing and overdue commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">From the point of view of health service users the capital programme is critically undermined by the savage spending cuts that continue to be imposed.  For example, the HSE is retreating from care of the elderly as shown by the closure of care homes in Abbeyleix, Dublin and Athlone in the past year.  Much of the existing health infrastructure — hospital wards and beds in public hospitals — goes unused because of the Minister's recruitment embargo and spending cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">What appears to be in an investment is too little and it is undermined by other elements of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In respect of transport, the previous speaker eloquently made the case for the construction of the A5 motorway.  Some of the Minister's colleagues on the benches opposite have become deeply concerned about matters in the North, including expenditure commitments.  Perhaps the Minister will inform them that whereas the commitment from up the road to fund the vital A5 project is still intact, the Government has retreated from its long-standing commitment to people in counties Derry and Donegal and the entire north-west region.  I ask him to make this clear to his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Projects such as metro north and the Navan to Dublin rail line would have significantly increased competitiveness and trade in the mid-east and north-west regions.  The metro west project and extension of heavy rail to Navan and the Luas to Lucan and Bray have been deferred.  The Government has missed a major opportunity to invest in job creation and, if I may say so as a Dubliner, make the capital city a better place to live, visit or do business in.  Thankfully, not all public transport projects have been scrapped and the BDX Luas link-up is set to proceed.  Given the substantial investment already made in the metro north project, the decision on the link-up is cold comfort to taxpayers as it will not provide anything close to the benefits of metro north.  By taking these regressive steps, the Government has again shown its lack of vision and placed the country at a disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The allocated budget for the improvement and maintenance of roads for 2012 has been reduced by €120 million on the 2011 Estimates and will continue to decrease in subsequent years.  This news will not be welcomed anywhere in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">On education, the Government has committed to constructing 40 new schools, with an even split between primary and secondary schools, while renovations or extensions are to be carried out on 180 schools.  As the Minister is aware, this investment is but a drop in the ocean when one considers the type of investment required at primary and secondary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Sinn Féin's pre-budget analysis and submission sets out much more ambitious targets which can be met.  The Government has put on ice the Grangegorman campus development by postponing it indefinitely.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the project has a long history.  Launched in September 2010 under the banner "Grangegorman — Building Dublin's Future", it was supposed to provide cutting edge mental health facilities and a state-of-the-art campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The project also promised to deliver 4,500 construction jobs and more than 1,000 permanent jobs post-construction in retail, maintenance and so forth.  Having been put on ice by the Government, will we now use the by-line "Grangegorman: Freezing Dublin's Future"?</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The report is lamentable in respect of broadband as it does not give any commitment to provide Exchequer funding for next generation broadband.  Instead, it states simply that the next generation broadband task force is due to report by the end of the year and aims to assist in identifying future infrastructures.  This type of <i> laissez-faire </i>attitude to the delivery of next generation broadband is nothing short of scandalous.  I am interested in hearing how the Minister will defend the Government’s position on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The water network is portrayed in the report as environmental infrastructure.  The report also notes that the allocation of €500 million to the Office of Public Works will include funding for flood relief.  Water services, including access to clean drinking water and proper drainage and sewerage services, are not environmental infrastructures.  The State is still at a stage where we require water infrastructure for reasons of human health and health and safety.  The provision made for flood relief programmes is inadequate.  In parts of this city the system is so antiquated that homes are regularly flooded in sewage and foul water.  The Government must revisit these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I hope I have made clear to the Minister in the short time available to me my party's serious disappointment with this grossly inadequate plan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_565">The Government, at the behest of the European Union and International Monetary Fund, is pursuing the economics of the madhouse.  It is bad enough that tens of billions of euro are being poured into the vaults of banks and pockets of bondholders but the price being paid for this policy is mass unemployment and extreme suffering among some of the most vulnerable sectors of society.  It is not, however, only the moral injustice of this approach for which society is paying the price because, critically, we are robbing ourselves of the means to deal with the unemployment crisis and put the economy back on a sound footing which would allow us to recover and develop a sustainable economic future.  Nowhere is this issue more sharply focused than in the question of capital investment.  The State needs to play a key role in investing in our future and prioritising capital investment if we are to have any chance of getting out of what increasingly appears will be a 1930s style economic meltdown in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The policy of recapitalising private banks with a view to producing a flow of credit to small and medium enterprises, about which the Government argues it is seriously concerned, has been a catastrophic failure.  It has utterly failed either to produce a flow of credit to the SME sector or provide relief for mortgage holders whose circumstances are massively depressing demand in the economy.  If all of this were not bad enough, the one other possible avenue for moving matters forward and getting us out of the current mess, namely, State investment in key, strategic projects both in infrastructure and other areas where we could generate real wealth and employment, has been closed off.  State investment is even more important in light of the fact that the other key feature of the recession across Europe and specifically in this country has been the decision of the big players in the private sector effectively to go on strike and refuse to invest.  Given the collapse in private sector investment, who will make the investment that will get people back to work?  Only the State can fulfil this role but instead it is cutting capital investment at the behest of the EU and IMF.  There is no way forward if the Government persists with this approach.   I find it somewhat laughable that the Minister speaks about the improvements in our infrastructure in recent years.  Money has been spent on infrastructure and there may have been some improvements, but he only has to look at the floods last week and the devastating impact they have had on many parts of the city to realise how bad our water infrastructure is and how criminal it was that we did not invest in rehabilitating that water and drainage infrastructure.  That will cost not only the victims of those floods, but society in general, if we do not invest in that.  I suggest the Minister reads <i>Ulysses</i>, because James Joyce complained a hundred years ago about the failure of the Office of Public Works to invest in the water infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">Education is key if we are to have any chance.  The construction of a new DIT campus in Grangegorman has been scrapped when we should be investing in that area.  In my own constituency, the IADT in Dún Laoghaire is 1,000 students over capacity because it was expecting new buildings, but the construction of these new buildings has now been shelved.  This is disastrous.  We have 96,000 people on the housing list, and the Government's policy is to stop building social housing and lease properties from private landlords instead.  This will be more costly for the State and will cripple the possibilities of economic growth, development and recovery if the Government persists in going ahead with these cuts in capital expenditure.  We need to increase investment in capital expenditure and that means telling the troika to get lost and to stuff their monetarist mantras.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_570">The Minister stated that the three objectives are jobs, schools and health care.  When this €17 billion is spent, it looks as if about 50,000 of the 447,000 currently out of work will be positively impacted by this investment, which is incredibly disappointing.  We all understand that there is a very constrained financial situation imposed on this State at the moment.  With the very limited time available, I would like to focus on one or two issues and I regret we do not have a lot more time.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The balance between capital spending on roads and public transport in recent programmes has improved in recent years.  On this particular occasion, it has been skewed dramatically in favour of roads as opposed to public transport.  There is twice the Exchequer spend on roads than on public transport, and that is very regrettable.  I would like to deal with one particular issue that could bring competitiveness if we invest correctly.  The State will recover from the city outwards and this particular city region is the biggest city, especially when counties that border it are included.  Since the Dublin transport initiative in the early 1990s, in which I was involved, the interconnector and what has become the DART underground has been part of every capital programme.  It would link the 19th century railway lines, which all terminated on the periphery of the city.  They were never networked.  That network would produce an absolutely astonishing result.  Barry Kenny of Irish Rail has said that it would be a "game changer".  It will treble the rail capacity from the current 33 million passengers per annum to 100 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The money invested from Structural Funds in the early 1990s was based on various themes.  One of the reasons for investment in public transport, such as the Luas and other projects, was because it would make this area more competitive.  Congestion was causing a serious impediment to doing business in this region.  The one project that could have pulled all that together and been a real driver of competitiveness was the DART underground, or the interconnector.  I think it is absolutely criminal that this is not going ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">We have to be imaginative about some of these projects.  Even in the dark days of the 19th century, money was put into the railway system.  Most of it was put in from private funds.  There may well be scope in the pension funds to invest in something that would produce a return like this particular project.  Part of the reason for proposing the new children's hospital at a site on the Mater hospital was due to the public transport improvements to be made.  They are now being downgraded from the capital programme and that is very regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">If we are going to recover, we have to give ourselves the best possible chance.  By not investing in some of these big capital projects, such as DART underground and metro north, we are reducing the capacity of that part of the country that has the numbers and needs that extra lift in competitiveness.  We are reducing the chance of an early recovery by virtue of that one particular decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">I want to make a point about the A5, which was mentioned by previous speakers.  It is important to realise the complexity of that particular project, which will bring investment to the north west.  It is important to state a few facts.  The Fianna Fáil Party, in its programme for Government, did not have one single penny for that capital project.  Sinn Féin produced a pre-budget submission yesterday that did not make one reference to the A5 programme.  It is important that we get a bit more illumination on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I would like to acknowledge the role played by Deputy McDonald's colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  Once this debate emerged last week, there was much grandstanding, jumping up and down and noise made about a project being shelved, even though it is not being shelved.  Obviously, it is being reprofiled due to the economic situation, but it is important to say that this project is still alive.  There is a critical meeting this Friday of the North-South Ministerial Council that will decide on how we move forward with the project.  I acknowledge the role Deputy Mac Lochlainn has played in having a little bit of calm about this.  Ultimately, it is sensitive to a region, it cuts across jurisdictions and parties and the mechanisms towards which we aspire through the North-South Parliamentary Forum will be critical to developing integrated projects.</p>

We explained that our commitment is ongoing.  I have another bilateral meeting with the Minister, Sammy Wilson, in advance of the North-South Ministerial Council on Friday, and it will be formally discussed there.  The Taoiseach has indicated the Government's commitment to build this road and assist in its building over time, but in truth, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure now.  Bluntly, we do not have £400 million sterling to allocate to this project, and that is understood.  The Taoiseach has said we would be prepared to make a contribution of the order of €25 million per annum in the latter stages of the project, in the two years 2014 and 2015, from the unallocated reserve, and that will be done.</p>

I am shocked the Government did not move more quickly to stop Wexford County Council from buying the land for something that we cannot afford to build.  The county council talks about spending over €12 million on land for that project before Christmas, although we cannot actually build the bypass.  We are well aware of the fact that there is a shortage of money.  It is pure nonsense to spend €12 million on land now.  We have better things to be doing with €12 million.  This project cannot go ahead in the next 20 years.  If we are going to spend any money on this, we should consider an inner relief bridge, which will do the job, and forget completely about the 14 kilometre bypass.</p>

Even if I accept that logic, I cannot see why the Government has axed the metro north project.  I would like the Minister to give us some more detail on this.  The cutting of this project does not save billions.  In fact, it is the only transport project that is ready to go; within a matter of weeks or a couple of months we could have hundreds of people employed on the enabling works.  The cost to the State over the next five years is only about €700 million, which is not excessive given that it would put to work thousands of construction workers.  This is true; the Minister's staff can advise him.  It is the State's contribution.  The project is a public private partnership with two operators still in the pipeline.  How can the Minister justify this given the impact it would have on the northside of Dublin in terms of job creation, economic stimulus and so on?  It seems absolutely bizarre.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">In the same context, what revisions is the Minister making in light of the new economic projections?  We can save him money out in the north county — money that could be spent on the metro north — by revisiting the greater Dublin strategic drainage study.  The Minister has confirmed his Government's desire to spend €2.5 billion on a new monster sewage treatment plant for north County Dublin based on projections made a number of years ago for dealing with waste water up to 2040.  It is the assertion of many residents and environmentalists in the area that cheaper alternatives could be found through the development of more localised plants.  Why is the Government confirming that this project is to go ahead when it could save money and have a greater environmental impact by treating waste water on a more sustainable basis?  We would prefer the Minister to revisit that and divert the moneys back to the metro north.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I was hoping we could broaden the debate.  Anybody can come in here and advocate projects.  I can give the Deputies another list of projects they could add to that.  It is great, and they can read about it in the local papers if they want to.  We are all advocates for everything.  I had hoped that we might move to a different kind of debate — a debate about economic sustainability and making real choices.  There are people who are concerned about cuts on the current expenditure side.  I have heard some loud voices over the last number of weeks arguing for deeper cuts in current expenditure — in social welfare, health and education — to lessen the cuts that must be made on the capital side.  However, all the voices I have heard here are saying they want everything.  People want to spend on every single project and cut back on none.  Nobody has stood up and said that one particular project is the one we should——</p>

          <p eId="para_605">We can have the mantra of Tommy Cooper economics: "Just like that."  It will go away "just like that".  Tell the bondholders to go away.  Tell the ECB we do not need its money.  The problem is that we do need its money.  There is nobody else funding us.  People are not fools; they want realistic debate.  They will come to any committee to hear realistic debate.  It is not an option, as the people of Greece and Portugal know, to tell the only people who are funding our gardaí, nurses and doctors to take a hike.  That is not an option.  Let us be realistic about making choices.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Let me deal with the specifics.  We cannot afford the metro north in the medium term.  We made choices in that regard.  Of course it is a laudable project; we would love it.  I would love to stand up, as some people in the past stood at these benches, and announced hundreds of millions here and hundreds of millions there.  There was no end to what could be announced.  However, we are living in different times.  We have made strategic decisions to focus limited capital on jobs, schools and health care.  For that reason, we are building 40 additional schools.  Deputy McDonald says that is a drop in the ocean.  We would love to build more, but we have not the wherewithal to do it, unless the Deputies would like us to cut deeper or tax more, because we cannot borrow more.  These are the choices that people understand we are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Specific points were made about the metro north.  It is not affordable in the medium term, but it is on hold.  People say we have spent a lot of money to date.  Yes, we have.  The previous Governments did, but we are not in a position to go ahead with it in the short term.  Of the three big infrastructural projects — the metro north, the DART interconnector and the Luas line BXD — the Luas project, which will link the two Luas lines, will go ahead, but the metro north is not affordable, as we have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">We are spending €1.6 billion on water.  I agree entirely with the point made by Deputy Wallace.  When I was Minister for the Environment I made a specific instruction on the matter.  While engineers seek to build more dams and carry out more big projects, blocking the leaks is the priority.  It is shocking and unacceptable that even after spending more than €1 billion we still have leakage from our mains of the order of 40%.  I hope this will be the priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I will discuss local issues, including the New Ross bypass, with Deputy Wallace separately.  I have made clear to my colleagues from the minute I went into my current Department that they should not spend money on projects that will not go ahead.  I will examine specifically the land purchase issue to which Deputy Wallace referred and perhaps I will respond to him privately.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">I have answered the issue raised by Deputy Daly on the metro north project.  I do not have an answer on the specifics of the alternatives of various engineering solutions to deal with waste.  That is an appropriate question to pursue with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">The Minister is right.  It is a question of choices.  In our budget submission we will put forward a programme of asset and wealth taxes that could be utilised to pay for measures to put people back to work and to put jobs back on the highest point of the agenda again.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I have a particular question relating to the new children's hospital.  Before the election, many Deputies on the other side of the House, including the Minister for Health, came to the people of Crumlin to discuss the children's hospital.  They said that the new Mater site was not a good site, nor one they would support.  We all seek the best for our children and to make the best resources available for them but this is a matter of part funding the construction of a new children's hospital.  The licensing will be examined in future but we do not know what type of licence will be put out for the national lottery and we do not know what protection will be given to the State in this regard.  On the radio on Sunday morning I heard an advocate of the children's hospital suggest that they have sorted out the traffic problems, that there will be signage from the Naas Road to the Mater site and that if there are any problems on the way to the hospital the emergency services will be able to respond and get people from any given spot to the hospital etc.  The person concerned appealed for ordinary people to donate €100 to build wards and so on.  There is a significant question mark over all of this.  We need the best for our children and at present there are three hospitals in place which, to my mind, can deliver this.  There has been significant investment in the Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin in recent times, including new wards, operation theatres etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The question of metro north should not be an either-or situation and I have no wish to pose it that way.  However, I raise the issue because people do not see the rationale of the new Mater site or the proposal to put it there.  What is the intention of the site at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin if the Mater project goes ahead?</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_616">I will be as concise as possible.  I have a macro question and a micro question.  I will not waste time on the debate we have held many times here except to ask the Minister about the larger macro picture.  Notwithstanding previous differences we have had in debates on this issue, is there not some recognition on the part of the Government and euro leaders that in the wake of the significant downgrading of growth prospects in Europe we should start to raise our voices against the merits and sustainability of the austerity policy?  Should we not be shouting from the rooftops that it is not working?  It has been tried and it is not working.  In fact, it is robbing us of the investment funds we need to get things moving again.  I will not labour the point but it seems the evidence is piling up in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Minister asked where we could we get the money.  Let us set aside the larger European questions of bondholders and so on.  Does the Minister not agree that the collapse in private sector investment means that we should get hold of the capital available in society which is not being invested?  To answer the Minister's question, does this not mean we should tax the small minority that have the capital and wealth but who are not investing it and who, frankly, in many cases got this wealth through questionable means?  This vast wealth which has been built up in this country is distributed among the top 5%.  Why will the Minister not consider wealth taxes to get from that small minority the investment funds that we could then put into developing infrastructure and strategic industry, instead of cutting the strategic investment area, a policy which will be so damaging for out economic future?</p>
          <p eId="para_618">My last question relates to a parochial issue but it is symptomatic and it relates to what Deputy Daly said as well.  The question is not simply parochial and it seems to me the Minister should examine this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_620">This is a question.  In some cases we are going ahead with capital projects that people do not want and the justification for which is questionable while in other areas there are projects that people want and the value of which is not disputed by most people but which are not proceeding.  The waste treatment plant in north Dublin is one example.  The local authority in my area is proposing to spend €35 million on a new administrative headquarters for the library which no one asked for and no one sought.  Yet there are empty buildings in public ownership which could be used for the same purpose but the local authority will not give one third of that money to develop the tourist infrastructure on the seafront, such as Dún Laoghaire baths, which people have been crying out for and which could attract tourists to the area or to the Carlisle Pier.  Will the Minister examine seriously such matters because it is a waste of money?</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_621">I will deal with Deputy Collins's point on the children's hospital first.  Whatever Deputy Collins's view on the merits of the location, that is settled.  The Government said it would carry out a review and we brought in an international panel to review it.  We can review forever or we can do something and I believe it is time to do something.  I disagree with the Deputy's point that the existing pattern of children's hospitals is enough.  According to world best practice, we need a national tertiary children's centre for our children comparable to the best in the world and this is what we will have.  We will fund it through some money from the capital programme and augment it from a different type of licensing regime.  It happens that the national lottery licence expires at the end of this year and it is my intention to extend the An Post licence for one or one and a half years until we get a different licensing regime in place, which will probably be longer in duration and with a requirement for an upfront payment which could be applied to this important infrastructure.  This is a novel and important way of dealing with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The future of the hospital in Crumlin is a matter the Deputy should speak to the Minister for Health about.  I simply do not have the answer because I am dealing with the overall capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I enjoy my interactions with Deputy Boyd Barrett but we hold fundamentally different views on how to deal with the issues.  Our fiscal path is working despite all the volatility and we are returning to growth at a level of approximately 1% this year and with projected growth of 1.6% next year.  Next year we will project into a growth path that will be jobs rich and we will start creating jobs again and this is important.  Growth based exclusively on exports which is not jobs rich is not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Deputy is right — we must strike a balance between what we take out of the economy without stifling growth yet we must live within our means.  The notion that we have the resources for a stimulus such as that undertaken in the United States is simply fanciful.  We do not have the resources and no one is giving us money to invest other than what we can garner ourselves.  We have tried to be creative as we were with the jobs initiative earlier.  People objected when we put a levy on pension funds to generate some money to give hope and confidence to the tourism sector, precisely the sector that Deputy Boyd Barrett instanced, and we are examining other innovative methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I wish to refer briefly to other mechanisms for funding  I am open to examining, with an open mind, any funding mechanisms which will put vital infrastructure into this economy.  That is why I referred to in my speech last week and again today to the importance of public private partnerships.  They are not all dead ducks.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">We are impaired as a sovereign nation and because of that some PPP projects are in difficulty.  However, a number of investment funds now see Ireland as a recovering economy and a good place to invest.  We need to give them the wherewithal to do that as long as it makes sense for the Irish taxpayer and creates value for money.  I have asked my Department to be proactive on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">As part of the development of the strategic investment fund the first tranche announced last week is €1 billion.  It will leverage €350 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is being managed by an Australian management outfit which is confident it can leverage that into a billion euro fund.  It is the first of many funds we want to create to invest in job creation endeavours in this economy and we will lay those plans out into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Capital is mobile and can leave the economy readily.  We found that out in the immediate aftermath of our economic difficulties when there was an enormous flight of capital.  That is a reality of which the Government has been mindful.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The final point on value for money is a good point.  The Green Party caused me some angst when it was on these benches.  A minority party, comprising 3% of the Government, wanted to dictate local policy.  Even if I do not like local democratic policy in a particular place, if that is the will of the people who are elected to make decisions it is up to the electorate to decide.  Somebody at the centre should not be saying, "I know better."  We need value for money.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">The Minister said he has no options but he does.  Instead of cutting €750 million from the capital fund he could keep it as it is and make savings in other areas.  Sinn Féin produced a document which makes a similar type of adjustment, reduces the deficit to GDP ratio and is not contingent on bondholders or the policies we advocate on the banks.  The Minister could implement these policies tomorrow morning but has decided to follow the same track as Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">It cut capital spending over three years by approximately 50%.  The amount spent was reduced from €9 billion to just over €4 billion.  The Government is planning to take out 25% over a short period.

          <p eId="para_636">——the loss of some 7,500 jobs?</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Minister referred to the jobs plan last June.  The Government injected an additional €32 million in capital spending and dressed it up with other measures as a jobs plan.  The Minister must acknowledge it is an anti-jobs plan given that 20 times the amount of capital spending is being sucked out than was put in in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The A5 is not a parochial issue.  I am very proud of being from Donegal and I challenge the Minister to examine the investment in public and private infrastructure made in Donegal over the past decade.  Transport 21 was flawed and I said so at the time because it put the north west to the very tail end of the project.  When things went wrong we were left with absolutely nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Deputy McHugh referred to the lack of rail services.  Donegal is one of three counties which does not have a rail service.  We did not receive the same type of investment in the past.  The issue is not just a road to the north-west end of Donegal.  Rather, it is about creating a competitive region.  An area with the highest level of deprivation and huge structural unemployment problems needs to have a dual carriageway.  It would lift the competitiveness of the region and reduce employers' transport costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The Minister mentioned the project is being deferred but gave a political commitment that it will be fulfilled at some time in the future.  He also gave a commitment that a sum of €25 million will be injected in 2014 and 2015, a figure which is too small.  Over the next 48 hours the Minister, along with the Taoiseach and others such as the Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, will be centrally involved in getting the project back on track.  A unilateral decision was taken by the Government which has put the project at risk but it can be brought back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Can the Minister give me a commitment as to when he envisages the €350 million required for the project from the State will be allocated?  Does he acknowledge this is not just a commitment from the Dáil but is part of an international agreement, the St. Andrews agreement?  I was centrally involved in it, in terms of the peace dividend.  I could read out the letter from the Taoiseach in which he committed to the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I want to hear the political commitment to the project and start the money will be extended in 2013 and 2014, as the Minister said.  I would like to hear that additional money to the €25 million promised will be allocated.  When will the entire amount be allocated?  We on this side of the Border cannot plan for a major infrastructural project at a cost of approximately €1 billion where three contractors have already been appointed if we did not know from where and when 40% of the funding was to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I commend the Minister and his officials on putting together a multi-year plan.  It is very useful.  I read through the document in some detail and there are some great ideas in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">My concern with the plan is that there is no detail which allows me, as a Member of Parliament, to understand why particular things have been allocated.  The Minister picked four pillars and there is reference to €200 million and €1 billion.  The total amount is €17 billion over the term.  However, there is no cost benefit analysis or decision criteria.  I cannot find any reference to the projected number of jobs and there is a fairly thin section on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I welcome the focus on labour-intensive work, which is exactly right.  It is impossible for me to read the document and decide whether it is a good idea because it is essentially a list of ways to spend money.  It reminds me of the Fianna Fáil smart economy document which was complete nonsense and comprised a list of vanity projects and a waste of money.  There was no strategic thinking.  There is strategic thinking in this document but it is missing any details which would allow me, other members of the Opposition or economic think tanks to get under its skin and understand why the Government has made particular decisions and decided certain things should not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The nicely produced document looks like a <i>fait accompli</i>  by the Minister and his officials, and he is presenting it to the Parliament and people as what is going to happen.  We will discuss this issue in Parliament next week and potentially the following week.  Will the Minister immediately release the detail behind these decisions, such as cost benefit analyses, decision criteria and things which were considered and not included, in order that we can have a well-informed debate?  Is this a <i>fait accompli</i>?  Are we discussing this in terms of input to the plan or is the Minister telling us what is going to happen while we provide general reactions to that?</p>

          <p eId="para_648">I will be as brief as I can.  I am interested in considering and will cost any proposal from the other side of the House.  We will give Members the facility to do that — they may already have been invited to do so — in a Chinese wall way, whereby proposals may be costed before they are submitted on the floor of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">In terms of the capital spend, we are charged with making political decisions in terms of what is affordable within the total volume of expenditure.  That is what Government does.  We must address our enormous deficit and return to affordable patterns of expenditure.  The projected deficit this year will be of the order of 10.3% and our target for next year is 8.6%.  By international standards, that amounts to an extraordinarily high level of borrowing to fund the Exchequer.  In addition, we have an overhang of crippling private banking debt which was imposed on us by the previous Government.  We have worked might and main to limit that as best we can, and have already achieved reductions in the applicable interest rates.  The Taoiseach is in Germany today putting forward our case in this regard.  We are working on ideas all the time to reduce the quantum of debt on the State so that we can restore equilibrium and return to making rational decisions for ourselves without being overseen by others.  That is the general approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I would love to be able to say that we could proceed with the A5 project, but the reality is that I do not have the necessary STG£400 million to match the contribution of the Northern Ireland authorities.  Going ahead with that project would mean having to abandon other critical infrastructural projects elsewhere on the island.  We must be very careful in all of the choices we make.  Other projects which were expected to proceed, such as the completion of the M11 to my home constituency, will not happen within the timeframe that was originally envisaged.  The south east will be as deprived as the north west in that sense.</p>

I met with Northern Ireland's finance Minister, Mr. Sammy Wilson, to discuss the matter in advance of our announcement on the A5 project.  We will have a bilateral meeting on Friday in advance of the full North-South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh.  Dialogue is ongoing in that regard.  There is an understanding that this may be done on a phased basis and that some bottlenecks are more critical than others.  To clarify, I stated incorrectly that the €25 million allocation is for 2014 and 2015; in fact, it is for 2015 and 2016.  I wish it could be more and that we had the wherewithal to proceed with that project and with others, including metro north.  However, the funding is not available within the envelope with which I have been charged with crafting an expenditure pattern on the capital side.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Deputy Donnelly asked about cost benefit analyses and whether the plan that has been announced is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  There is a rationale behind the decisions we have made and every single project has been subjected to voluminous analysis.  I cannot provide all of that information to the Deputy because it is a matter for each line Department.  It is certainly feasible that a committee of the House might choose to analyse the projects that have been frontloaded and deferred in specific Departments and perhaps come up with an argument against the choices the Government has made.  I will send the Deputy a note on the principles underlying those  decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The plan is not a <i>fait accompli</i>, but it represents the Government’s decision in terms of the envelope of expenditure.  To put it bluntly, our economic situation and that of our European partners is changing so rapidly that nobody would be foolish enough to say with certainty that a five-year plan will be implemented without change.  We may well amend some of the details of the plan, hopefully to add more to it in the mid-term review rather than having to finish it earlier and cancel certain initiatives.</p>

When does the Minister envisage that the remaining GB £350 million will be provided?  He has said he is politically behind the project.  Will the funding be forthcoming in 2017, 2018 or 2027?  The Government must have some idea of when the remainder will be given.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">The Minister has called for a discussion based on economic sustainability.  That has been the focus of debate as politicians from Dublin, in particular, focused on the capital projects that may or may not go ahead.  It will come as no surprise to anybody that I am particularly interested in metro north.  Members on this side of the House based our proposals, as Opposition parties, on information provided to us by the previous Government.  The problem is that there was no substance behind the budgetary headings in the capital budget.  We have had to deal with that legacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">We must be realistic in our approach to the capital budget, which has had to be reduced significantly.  The bottom line is that the resources simply are not there.  I support Deputy Donnelly's call for further information on the rationale behind the plan, particularly in regard to the projects we are likely to revisit in the coming years, such as metro north and Thornton Hall.  These are projects in which there has been significant investment by the taxpayer over a period of years.  A failure to provide a concrete rationale for these and other decisions that will be made in the coming years would be regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">On a positive note, I welcome the commitment to proceed with the Luas BXD project, which will have an important impact on transport provision in the capital.  Will the Minister outline the decision that has been made in regard to investment in the Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fleets?</p>

          <p eId="para_666">The idea is that we would consider how to get a better commercial take and how to front-load money.  We expect the amount of money we can front-load will more than cover the component required for the national children's hospital.  It is not notionally linked to it: it will guarantee that the national children's hospital will proceed.  We have a choice to make.  In the plan Deputy Dooley's Government produced there is an element for philanthropy and we need to make a call on how robust that component might be in the current climate.  Regardless, we are determined to build the national children's hospital in the timelines provided, assuming that planning permission is granted as expected.</p>

We have recapitalised banks that were owned and we have a shareholding in them, but the volume of investment is not entirely our money and we need to make rational commercial decisions on lending.  We are considering mechanisms to leverage additional resources through public-private partnerships.  The banks, including AIB and other Irish banks, may well partner international banks, including the European Investment Bank in some of the projects that might proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I agree entirely with Deputy Alan Farrell on the Luas BXD line.  It did not make sense to build two Luas lines that did not interconnect.  If one were to pick a project, it makes sense that it would at least be a unifying project.  I regret that metro north will be postponed.  To deal with the point about the economic case studies, these are in the line Departments and not in my Department.  Enormous volumes of analysis are done on these big projects.  Deputy Farrell also mentioned the money spent on Thornton Hall and the Minister for Justice and Equality is beside me.  Very few of us on this side of the House were not shocked at the quantum of money used to buy a field.  It was a peculiar way to go about a project to say "I have €40 million to spend.  Who will sell me a field?"  We cannot simply apply the logic that as we have wasted so much we should carry on regardless.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_685">That Dáil Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 23 March, 2005 and by Seanad Éireann on 24 March, 2005, as amended by the Resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann on 1 June, 2011, pursuant to the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004, be further amended as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_686">1. by substituting the following paragraph for paragraph (I):</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_687">‘(I) the tribunal shall report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis not later than 9 March, 2012 setting out:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_688">(a) the number of parties granted representation,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_689">(b) the progress which has been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_690">(c) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas;'; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_691">2. in paragraph (IV) by substituting ‘31 May, 2012' for ‘30 November, 2011'."</p>
          <p eId="para_692">This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into allegations of collusion by members of the Garda Síochána or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal was established in 2005 and is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former president of the District Court.  The Oireachtas established the tribunal in light of Judge Peter Cory's report in a genuine desire to get at the truth both in the interest of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity and in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The House will recall that on 1 June I proposed an amendment to the Smithwick tribunal's terms of reference to afford the Dáil the opportunity to consider the state of play with the tribunal's work and to establish a timeframe for its completion.  That proposal was consistent with the chairman's previous indication to me of a timeframe for his work.  I do not believe it would be helpful to the work of the tribunal to rehearse again some of the arguments which arose in this House at that time.  Suffice it to say that it is clear that the tribunal has been making substantial progress in its public hearings and there is now an appropriate mechanism in place for this House to be informed of the tribunal's progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I put it clearly on the record of the House that if, for any reason, it did not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, then the chairman could report to the Clerk of the Dáil that circumstances had arisen which required the timeframe to be extended in order that the House could consider the matter further.  I also gave the House a solemn assurance that the Government's response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  I am happy to be able to tell the House that today's motion follows through on my assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The chairman, in accordance with the resolutions of the Oireachtas in June, presented his interim report on 29 June 2011, in which he reported that good progress had been made in the tribunal's work to that point.  The tribunal's opening statement, which the chairman submitted with that interim report, sets out fully the background to the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Deputies will be aware that the tribunal chairman wrote to the Clerk of the Dáil on 5 October 2011 setting out the circumstances which have arisen since June and which led him to seek a six-month extension for the tribunal's work.  The chairman stated in his letter that the tribunal had heard 105 witnesses to that date and has continued with other aspects of its inquiries.  I welcome the progress the tribunal is making and I am pleased that this House is being kept informed of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The Government has considered the extension sought by Judge Smithwick and proposes that the Oireachtas should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal to conclude its work and to present its final report to 31 May 2012.  This is fully in line with the tribunal chairman's request.  The motion also requires the chairman to prepare and submit a further interim report by 9 March 2011 on the state of play of its inquiry at that date.  It is my view that it is appropriate that the Oireachtas should be kept apprised of the tribunal's progress and the interim report fulfils that.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Furthermore, I believe that it is in the public interest and in the interests of those most directly concerned by the tribunal's work that it should get to the truth and report as soon as possible.  That is the objective of the motion before the House.  As the establishment of this tribunal was previously agreed by all sides in the House and as the need to establish the truth relating to the circumstances which led to the murderous atrocity which resulted in the tragic death of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan has not previously been a matter of contention in this House, I found it surprising that this morning on the Order of Business the Technical Group, including my constituency colleague, Deputy Ross, opposed today's arrangements for the taking of this motion.  The Government hopes that the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the timeframe set out in the motion.  However, if an unanticipated difficulty subsequently emerges with the target date for conclusion, I have no doubt that the chairman will report this, following which the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to consider the matter further.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Government respects and defends fully the independence of the chairman to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour.  I am confident that the tribunal will fully discharge its responsibilities and that this motion will assist in that endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I commend the motion to the House.</p>

I compliment Judge Smithwick and his team on the manner in which they have carried out their work to date.  It is clear that the work they did in private session, ahead of the commencement of the public tribunal, was worthwhile and necessary.  Since commencement of the public hearings we have had a clear and coherent narrative on a dark chapter in the life of this country.

          <p eId="para_705">I share the Minister's concerns in regard to the manner in which the taking of this motion was opposed this morning.  We are talking in this regard about people's lives.

Like Deputy Calleary, we believe that an issue to which we will need to return at a later date is the establishment of a process which will enable people on all sides who lost loved ones during the course of the conflict to obtain the answers that will bring them comfort.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">While on the last occasion we discussed this issue in the House there was support for the work of the tribunal and the ongoing work of Judge Smithwick, Sinn Féin expressed opposition to a timeframe being put on the work of the tribunal.  However, the Minister stated on that occasion that if the chairman of the tribunal requested more time he would grant such request.  That request has since been received and true to the Minister's word the timeframe is being extended.  Sinn Féin supports the timeframe now being put in place at the request of the chairman.  We also acknowledge that the Minister has stated that if such timeframe requires further extension he will consider it.  For this reason, we support the motion before the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_708">I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  However, I would like in the first instance to respond to the Minister's remarks in regard to the Technical Group.  What the Minister said was not necessary, fair or warranted.  A member of the Technical Group sought to raise an important issue this morning, namely, the protest of students in the city today in relation to broken promises by the Government, many of which promises the Minister was elected on.  That is the matter which the Deputy wished to raise.  He was not objecting to the taking of this motion.  I did not speak to the Deputy prior to his raising the matter nor have I since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">As a member of the Technical Group, I want to defend our record.  We are not in any way undermining or opposing this worthy motion.  It is a pity the Minister introduced those remarks into his speech, which I am sure was prepared before today.  However, that is not surprising having previously heard the Minister make nasty remarks across the House to Members.  What the Minister said, could not be further from the truth.  I and other members of the Technical Group and Opposition were not aware that the time for raising issues is lost when a number of votes have been called.  The matter was raised given the importance of the issue and for no other reason.  We are all fully supportive of this motion, which seeks to meet the request of the imminent chairperson, Judge Smithwick.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">On the last occasion Judge Smithwick raised the issue of extension of the timeframe, the Minister raised eyebrows to it.  The tribunal is taking a long time to complete its work but it is dealing with a sensitive issue.  I accept other tribunals are also dealing with sensitive and important issues such as fraud and so on.  However, in this instance traumatised families are involved.  They have paid the ultimate sacrifice in terms of the murder of the two RUC officers concerned.  It has been suggested that there was a mole in the Garda Síochána.  The good name of the Garda Síochána must be cleared.  I understand the tribunal has so far heard from 105 witnesses and that it has a small number of staff, unlike other tribunals, current and past, which are lengthy and often present reports which one would need a great deal of time to read or an assistant to carry them from A to B.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The Technical Group supports the motion.  We wish the tribunal a speedy conclusion.  It is hoped all the witnesses, of which there are a number, will be listened to.  As I stated earlier, the ultimate sacrifice was the death of the two RUC officers on that perilous day as they returned home from the Republic, as was the case in respect of so many other tragedies in the North.  It is important the tribunal is given the time it needs to complete its work.  The Minister stated that if further time is required, that will be considered.  However, I do not believe that will be necessary.  I believe those involved are interested in bringing this matter to a conclusion and in clearing the names of particular people.  It is hoped that if wrongdoing is discovered it too will be outed.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_712">I thank Deputies for their contributions.  It is important that we do not forget the events that lie behind this tribunal.  Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan, two unarmed policemen, were targeted in a well planned ambush by an IRA murder squad.  They faced a hail of bullets and both were shot in the head at close range.  In short, they were victims of a cold-blooded execution.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The tribunal is carrying out an important inquiry to establish the truth behind suggestions that gardaí or other State employees colluded in those killings and it must be allowed to carry out its work without hindrance.  It was always my intention that that occur.  I would like at this point to respond to Deputy Mattie McGrath.  We must remember that this tribunal was established in 2005.  When I took office more than €8 million of taxpayers' money had been spent on the tribunal, with no public report of any description to this House as to progress being made by it.  As a consequence of the steps taken in the motion passed in the House at the beginning of June, we received a progress report at the end of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">It is important that tribunals engaged in serious work, as is this tribunal, cannot carry on their work indefinitely, without ever reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas as to where matters stand.  While it would be entirely wrong for the tribunal to pre-judge the outcome of any issue which is the subject matter of its inquiries, it should inform the House where matters stand.  Taxpayers are also entitled to know this.  That was the purpose of the motion in June.  The timeframe then prescribed by the motion was based on a timeframe indicated to me by Judge Smithwick as the appropriate timeframe for conclusion of the tribunal's work.  It then turned out that Judge Smithwick had a different view subsequently.  That view has proven correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">However, the motion preceded the commencement of the oral hearings of the tribunal.  It has held extensive oral hearings and some parts of the oral hearings have been reported in the press. It would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to refer in any shape or form to any selection of the evidence reported to have been given.  It is of the utmost importance that the tribunal independently completes its oral hearings and its inquiries and produces a report.  It is my hope that it will now be able to fulfil the timeframe indicated to the Clerk of the Dáil by Judge Smithwick.  There is a very real public interest in the tribunal completing its work in reaching the conclusions appropriate to the evidence heard by it and the inquiries conducted by it, both in the national interest and very much in the interest of the bereaved families of the two RUC officers who so tragically died.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Nevertheless, having expressed the hope that the tribunal would complete its work within the now prescribed timeframe in the motion before the House, if something unexpected occurs and if Judge Smithwick again corresponds to the Clerk of the Dáil requiring a time extension, that will be given the consideration of Government and of the House.  There is a keen interest in ensuring the tribunal independently completes its work and deliberations and reports to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">On a final point, Deputy Mattie McGrath said that the Technical Group did not oppose this matter and that a Deputy in the Technical Group was raising another matter.  This was No. 12 on the Order of Business and it was the third proposal to be put to the House.  It was clearly a matter relating to the arrangements before the House for the taking of this very important motion.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_730">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2011, has a simple but important objective, namely, to increase the statutory limit on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities which may be incurred by the Irish Film Board.  As is the case with some statutory bodies which receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay when the Irish Film Board Act 1980, was enacted.  This limit must be reviewed by the Houses of the Oireachtas every five to six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2006 increased the limit from €101.5 million to €200 million.  In the absence of amending legislation, spending by the Irish Film Board will reach this statutory limit by the end of 2011.  It is now proposed to increase this limit to €300 million, to allow the Irish Film Board to continue to operate within an appropriate statutory limit, subject to the normal annual Estimates process.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The board has a dual mandate to develop Irish filmmaking and audiovisual production talent that can engage audiences both at home and abroad, while maintaining and building the resources, craft and skills of the Irish industry by attracting international productions to Ireland.  The primary function of the board is to provide development and production finance for Irish film and TV production projects.  Development loans are given to allow a project to be brought from the drawing board to the stage of being a properly researched and developed project, ready to be taken to the production stage.  Production loans contribute towards the actual cost of producing a finished film or documentary project.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Evidence of the necessity for this legislation is borne out by the activity of the Irish Film Board in recent years.  Since 2000, the board has assisted in the development of 856 feature film projects; 142 documentaries and 74 animation projects.  In the same period, the board has granted production finance to a total of 154 feature films, 140 documentaries, 385 shorts, 33 animation projects and 30 TV drama projects.  The film and television industry is labour-intensive and by its very nature, any investment in production creates employment.  On average, 70% of each production budget is expended on labour costs.  In the past six years, 2006 to 2011, the Irish Film Board expenditure is as follows: total budgets of the productions stood at €501 million; Irish Film Board investment stood at €58 million and Irish spend on the productions stood at €252 million.  Therefore, every euro invested by the board in production produces almost a tenfold return on that investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">With regard to the value of the industry in 2010, the recent IBEC audiovisual review gave a total production value of €388 million for that year, which is an increase of 57% on 2009.  The board has a crucial role in the development of Irish film and TV production projects.  It continues to play an essential part in providing the opportunities needed by emerging Irish talent and it has launched the careers of a number of young Irish film-makers.  The board also supports more established companies in producing Irish films with significant commercial prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">These past five years have seen the environment in which the board operates undergoing massive and constant evolution and development, both domestically and internationally.  I am pleased to say that the board has adapted to these changes.  It is well known that one cannot stand still in any endeavour if one is to succeed and the film sector is no exception.  One must adapt to changing circumstances in the type of projects being developed, the audience to be reached and the markets to be targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The Irish Film Board-funded comedy thriller, "The Guard", starring Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle, has become the most successful independent Irish film in Irish box office history, grossing over €4.13 million and it is continuing its success world-wide, taking over $4 million at the US box office to date.  This film, written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, has taken more at the Irish box office than international films such as, "The King's Speech", "The Hangover Part II", "Dark of The Moon" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides".  The film is also finding audiences around the world and has been in the top ten in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  To date, it has earned over $4 million in the United States.  With further releases planned for later this year in Germany, France, Italy and Holland the film is expected to become one of the most successful and valuable Irish film exports in recent times.  Such an international success will ensure that an Irish story, filmed in Ireland, will be projected all over the world, highlighting not only the wealth of talent and creativity the country has to offer but also promoting Ireland as a film and tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">A large number of major international feature films and television series have chosen Ireland as a film location as a result of the work the Irish Film Board does to promote Ireland at international film and television markets.  The positive impact of this work is three-fold in terms of creating jobs in Ireland, creating spend on local goods and services and promoting Ireland on big and small screens to millions of audiences internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">A major 12 part mini-series, "Titanic: Blood and Steel", is an example of this work.  It is currently filming in Dublin and Wicklow, with a run of 12 weeks and a budget of €12 million.  I was on the set last week and was very impressed.  The Irish-Italian television series which is planned for broadcast at the time of the 100th anniversary of the infamous vessel's launch and subsequent loss early next year has at the helm Irish director Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the very successful series, "The Tudors",  with support from Robert Quinn, a director of the "Primeval" television series.  Produced by Paul Myler for EPOS Films with the Italian De Angelis group, the project will provide approx 200 jobs for an Irish cast and crew.</p>

            <p eId="para_742">I have just received the report referred to by the Deputy, which relates to the sustainability of the existing funding framework for higher education.  The report, which was undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, was submitted to me on Monday of this week.  The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between funding levels, the scale of growth and the maintenance of quality in the system so that realistic and sustainable levels of growth in numbers can be supported and better informed choices on policy options for future funding can be made.  I will consider its findings and discuss them with my Government colleagues as part of our budgetary deliberations.  I understand the board of the Higher Education Authority will consider the report at its next meeting on 29 November next.  After the report has been considered, it is my intention that the Higher Education Authority should arrange to publish it without delay.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_743">When did the Minister receive the report?  Why does it have to go back to the board of the Higher Education Authority, given that the authority drew up the report in the first place?  I would have assumed that the board cleared the report before it went to the Minister.  I ask the Minister to impress on the authority the need to publish the report.  Perhaps it is within his own capability to do so.  People are anxious to have certainty on this issue, which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  When the Hunt report was published a year ago, the Minister, as his party's education spokesperson of the time, called for any follow-on studies to be published immediately.  Will he ensure this report is published as quickly as possible? The parents of students who aspire to go on to further education at third level want to know what the financial position is, what choices they might face and what onus will be on them with regard to costs at third level.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">I am not entirely sure why a report that is the product of another body has come to me first.  It has not come as a draft report.  The report has been completed.  I will make inquiries to find out why that has happened.  I will take on board the Deputy's point that the report should get into the public domain as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">The Minister gave a commitment and a strong pledge to the Union of Students in Ireland and the student body.  He said that if he was in government, he would reverse the €500 increase in the student service charge and the €200 charge for post-leaving certificate courses, both of which were introduced by the previous Government.  A year ago, the Tánaiste gave a commitment to the effect that the Labour Party was opposed to the introduction of third level fees by the front or back doors.  Can the Minister categorically assure us that he will honour the commitment and the pledge he gave to the Irish electorate on 21 February 2011, in the full knowledge of the fiscal position of the Government of the time?  I refer specifically to the written pledge he gave to the Union of Students in Ireland.</p>

The number of students in third level education increased from 100,000 in 1997 to 160,000 in 2010.  Such a 60% increase was a remarkable and necessary achievement.  Like everyone else in this House, I want to see a further increase in participation levels.  I ask the Minister to deny that the Government is considering putting a cap on student numbers in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">I do not know how many times it has to be conveyed to the Fianna Fáil Party that this country has lost its economic sovereignty.  It was signed away 12 months ago by a Government of which Deputy Smith was a member.  We control neither the chequebook nor the policy in relation to a range of items of public expenditure.  We have to work within that constraint.  We will do whatever we can to regain that economic sovereignty as quickly as possible.  The Deputy should not ask questions when he already knows the answers to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_749">The Minister made the pledge to which I refer on 21 February last, when the fiscal position of this country was well known.  This country's expenditure and income targets had been laid down in the budget that was delivered in this House in early December 2010.  All Government reports suggest those targets will be met this year.  The fiscal position has not changed.  It has improved somewhat, thankfully, since the Minister and his party leader — the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore — made a solemn commitment to students and subsequently won the support of a substantial percentage of this country's student population.  I suggest that many parents of students voted for them on that basis as well.</p>

          if the sanctioning of special needs transport by a special education needs organiser is subject to the limitations of the National Council for Special Education circular reference number NCSE 03/08, whereby health care professionals cannot identify a quantum of education supports and resources for a child with special educational needs when such professionals recommend that a child be enrolled in a special school in agreement with the parents and that school is located further away than the school recommended by a SENO as being capable of meeting the needs of the child despite professional reports to the contrary.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_753">Under the terms of the school transport scheme of the Department of Education and Skills, a pupil with special educational needs is eligible for school transport if he or she is attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet the child's special educational needs under the Department's criteria.  To date, the process of identifying such a school has involved the National Council for Special Education, which advises on this matter.  Circular NCSE 03/08 provides that responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to individual schools or individual children lies with the council through its special education needs organisers.  Health service staff do not have any responsibility for the allocation of educational resources or supports to schools or individual children.  Transport is provided following receipt of advice from the National Council for Special Education in relation to the relevant school.  The Department and the council intend to bring greater clarity and transparency to the process of identifying the nearest school.  A code of practice to provide guidance on this issue will be prepared with the assistance of the council's consultative forum in the coming months.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_754">I welcome the Minister of State's statement that the Department will clearly explain to parents how decisions on schools are made in these circumstances.  I became aware of this issue when the case of a six year old girl was brought to my attention.  She has autism, a rare chromosome disorder, fluid on her spine, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, limited speech and a hole in her heart.  She was in a school but it was recommended that she should go to a different school.  The people who made the recommendation said that the school in question was the best school for her.  The nearest school is not necessarily the best school for this child.  Who will parents listen to in such circumstances?  Will they listen to the health professionals they have been working with or to special education needs organisers they have probably never met?  That is part of the difficulty with regard to these decisions.  My question relates to cases of this nature.  How can the Minister of State explain the approach that is being taken to the mother of the girl I have mentioned?  A bus goes past this woman's house.  She has to travel 32,600 km per annum.  The system is not clear to me or to parents, many of whom are working within the system itself.  We are relying on special education needs organisers whose backgrounds might not be as informed as those of other professionals.  I refer to the psychologists etc. who made the original recommendations.  That is the difficulty.  We really need to sort it out.  The Minister of State is probably aware of many cases of this nature.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_755">If the Deputy wants to pass on the details of the individual case he has mentioned, I will undertake to explore it further with him.  Special education needs organisers have expertise in providing special education and assigning special educational supports to individual children on the basis of their unique individual needs.  The policy we operate is that transport shall be provided to a centre that is, or can be, resourced to meet the special educational needs of the child.  Such a decision is based on the opinion of a person who is professionally qualified to make such an assessment.  I agree with the Deputy that there has been a lack of clarity and transparency with regard to this process.  That is why we have undertaken to put a code of practice in place that can be easily understood by education professionals, by those involved in education and by parents and families.  We must bear in mind that at a time when I am challenged to find €17 million in savings across school transport over the next three years, we need to make the best possible use of the scarce resources we have.  The average cost of school transport for a child without special educational needs is approximately €1,000 per annum while the cost for a child with special educational needs is of the order of €7,000 to €9,000, depending on his or her unique requirements.  We must be careful not to over-extend ourselves by bringing children to centres which are further away than centres closer to home which are well capable of meeting their needs.

            <p eId="para_756">I welcome that because parents believe the reason they must go to local schools is purely on budgetary grounds.  It is does not make sense if there is a bus going by which has space on it.  In this case, the parent is a single parent but she is committed to that child, as are all such parents.  Those parents will travel to the ends of the earth if they believe it is the best school for their child.  The Minister of State is in a difficult situation in regard to this matter but the information needs to be made available to parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">I do not propose to give any specific commitment on the overall number of teaching posts in the education sector or on any changes to the pupil-teacher ratio and the impact it could have.  These are issues that I am considering with my colleagues in Cabinet in the context of the forthcoming budget discussions and meeting our obligations under the EU-IMF programme.  This is all the more challenging in the context of significant increases in demographics.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">The Government will endeavour to protect front-line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country.  The challenge will be to ensure the resources that are provided to schools are used by them to maximum effect in terms of providing an appropriate range of subjects to meet the needs of our knowledge economy and in delivering the best possible outcomes for all our pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">That is a disappointing response.  I asked the question because there is a lot of information out there which may well be misinformation or kite flying, but there are considerable concerns about the plan of action for our education system.  If the Minister reduces teacher numbers at second level, there could be a reduction in subject choices.  We talk about having a knowledge economy.  For example, physics and music are key subjects because one draws out different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">In regard to primary school class sizes, classes are very different from what they were even 15 years ago.  There is a much more mixed arrangement in that children with special needs are, by and large, in mainstream classes.  There are lots of children without languages skills.  The difficulty is that when people see education reform, they see it as code for cuts rather than reform of the system to deliver measurable outcomes in terms of the money we put in.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">In the absence of information, it is very difficult to ask a supplementary question.  I imagine we will get some of that information tomorrow when we see the programme to be outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to public service reform.</p>

It is still on.  The Deputy will get all the answers to all the questions in due course but I need time to discuss them first with my Cabinet colleagues.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">As the Minister said, the game is on and we wish him every success that he will have a good result in his Estimates.  We all appreciate it is not easy as there are competing demands.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party quite rightly included in their programme for Government a pledge to protect front-line services in education, which we all welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The first debate on education in this Dáil was a Private Members' motion which I tabled on behalf of Fianna Fáil that called on the Government to prioritise spending on education.  The Minister very magnanimously accepted that motion, as did all parties in this House.  I assume he got Government approval to accept that Private Members' motion and I hope he will be able to convince his colleagues to prioritise front-line services in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">This report appeared recently and I am not saying what union members said to me but what teachers at primary and second levels said to me.  They said that too often in the past, pupils were literally lost in large classes and they fear any deterioration in the pupil-teacher ratio.  There has been an improvement and, naturally, we want to see it further improved.  In 1997, the ratio was 22:1 while in 2010, it was down to 16:1.  All of us want to see that improved.  Any deterioration would be a huge set back for the education system.  I emphasise that teachers at primary and second levels are very concerned should there be any deterioration in the pupil-teacher ratio and increase in class sizes.</p>

However, as a former Minister, the Deputy will know that in Departments such as the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills, in particular, 80% of the budget is centred around salaries and related costs.  Therefore, the room for manoeuvre is confined to that 20% which affects the rest of the activities of the Department of Education and Skills.  In the context of the Croke Park agreement that means very difficult decisions must be made.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_772">Teachers will be supported in implementing junior cycle reform through the professional development service for teachers, focusing on the syllabus changes, assessment and school moderation.  The assessment and consideration of the resource implications of the proposals have begun.  These will, of course, fall to be considered in the normal way by Government in the context of the Estimates and budgetary processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">I have made no decision on the issue of history and geography being compulsory.  These skills are required of all students under the 24 statements of learning recommended by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school — as a teacher, Deputy O'Sullivan might welcome that sentiment — and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.  It is also important to avoid an erosion of the practical subjects.  The issue will be taken forward in discussions with the partners in education.</p>

            <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_774">Teachers have always shown they are very receptive to innovation and inventiveness because they have embraced quite a number of changes in syllabi over the years.  Education is about creating a well-rounded individual who has the transferable skills about which we speak.  I am always alarmed when I hear a particular section in society say that education must respond to X.  I dislike the idea that education can be corralled into a very narrow framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">I was delighted by what the Minister said about history and geography.  History was one of my subjects and it is a very important one which perhaps should be compulsory along with geography.  History is more than just learning facts, which is a very small part of it.  It is about examining evidence and looking at bias, distortion and at the media.  It is very important that young people learn to look at the media and how they can manipulate particular situations.  It is also about creative thinking.  Literacy and numeracy both come into subjects such as history and geography and I welcome what the Minister said.  I would be delighted if the Minister did not make the decision that they would not be compulsory.  Did he have discussions with the History Teachers' Association of Ireland, the Association of Geography Teachers of Ireland or any of the relevant professors?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_776">I do not know why there is such concern in the history and geography teaching communities about a fall-off in the study of their subjects.  The take-up in the junior certificate examination this year was 90.2% for history and 91.5% for geography, making them the fifth and fourth most popular subjects respectively.  While in the leaving certificate the percentages differ due to a wider range of subject choice, they were ninth and fifth respectively in popularity.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">History is far more than just the recitation of facts.  The analytical understanding why certain events occurred is a critical competent of the subject and is embedded in some of the skills we want to see emerge in the junior cycle reforms.  As we are entering into discussions with the education partners, I would be quite happy to meet with various stakeholders including the two associations of subject teachers to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">The leaving certificate applied course has been successful, part of which was due to the resources that went into it, the support for teachers, assessments and their monitoring.  These factors need to be borne in mind if we are going down that road with the junior certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">If a reformed junior certificate is introduced in 2014, will it be part of the curriculum training for the next intake of higher diploma in education, HDip, students?</p>

            <p eId="para_780">The courses offered at the teacher training colleges will go from three to four years while the HDip offered in other education institutions will be extended from a one-year course to a two-year course.  The concentration of the extra time and resources will be on pedagogic skills.  As the Deputy can testify, and from all the advice I have received, a good teacher is a good deliverer of good outcomes.  We must reinforce the good teacher.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_782">I have endorsed the broad thrust of the proposals on junior cycle reform submitted to me by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in October 2011 following an extensive consultation process.  It envisages all students will be expected to achieve 24 statements of learning over the three years of their junior cycle.  These include developing an understanding of the natural world, learning how to think and act sustainably, understanding the distribution of social, economic and environmental phenomena, valuing local and national heritage and recognising the relevance of the past to current national and international issues and events.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">It is clear, therefore, that geographical and historical awareness skills will be necessary to achieve the required outcomes.

            <p eId="para_784">I welcomed the NCCA report when it was published both through a press release and at the Oireachtas committee on education.  I compliment Professor Tom Collins, Anne Looney and their colleagues in the NCCA for the large amount of work they have carried out in the review since it was launched in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">I welcome the Minister indicating to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that he would meet the teaching associations for history and geography.  All Members are receiving concerns from teachers, not alone of history and geography, but other subjects.  While I appreciate the Minister has many commitments, it would be all the better if these meetings could take place as early as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">The NCCA report contains a framework for the new junior certificate which does not contain geography or history as core curriculum subjects.  This is a concern for teachers of these subjects.  A better explanation for the reasons behind this would be useful.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">The cap on subjects taken for the junior certificate examination can be introduced on a voluntary basis from the next school year.  Before the mandatory cap is introduced in 2014, will the Department examine participation levels in different subjects?  If a particular pattern or decline in subject participation emerges which is not good from an education point of view, it might allow a chance to redress the problem before the mandatory cap comes in.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">There are some statistics available on the number of subjects junior cycle students take.  I will make them available to Deputies later to better inform them of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">The Deputy is correct that we have suggested that schools, on a voluntary basis, could reduce the number of subjects in which junior certificate examinations are taken to figure out the implications of the cap.  Students from September 2014 will be the first cohort of the new junior certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">We are looking for a new name for the certificate.  I have invited the Irish Second-Level Students Union and its president, Leanne Caulfield, to come back with a proposed name, as they are the people who will have to sit the examination.  I want a new name for it to indicate it is not a revised or reformed course but a different type of course.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">I am happy to meet with all the stakeholders.  However, to ensure the meetings are productive, the stakeholders should meet first with the relevant sections of the Department dealing directly with their concerns.  This will allow us highlight and identify the issues which require a political response rather than just clarification.</p>

            <p eId="para_793">Applications for part-time language support at primary level relate to schools that have less than 14 eligible pupils for language support. Decisions on these applications were deferred until the autumn, having regard to the overall level of demand for full-time language support and other upward pressures on teacher numbers in the context of operating under a fixed ceiling on teacher numbers.  The increased retention level of pupils at post-primary level is a significant factor in the increased demand for teacher numbers.  For many years this retention level has hovered around 81% but is now closer to 85%.  While increasing this retention level is a long standing goal of the Department, it does nevertheless affect our capacity to manage within the fixed ceiling on teacher numbers.</p>

The reply it received from the Department was similar to the one the Minister just read with references to upward pressures on teacher numbers due to higher retention levels.

            <p eId="para_800">My Department has identified a requirement for new schools in the Tallaght area to cater for increasing demographics.  These new schools will also serve to strengthen diversity of school provision in the area based on parental demand for the type of schools to be provided.  In addition, there will be a requirement to extend some existing schools to meet the demographic need.  In this regard, my Department is currently examining an application from the school to which the Deputy refers for improved and extended accommodation.

It would be madness for a local Deputy to object to that but this school thought it was top of the list in terms of new build.  They have shared a premises since the school opened and the difficulty now is that one of the prefabs they were using is defunct and the children can no longer use it.  It is a gaelscoil and it now must use classes in some of the other schools, which is creating difficulties.  The correspondence and discussion between the school and the forward planning unit had ceased as far as they were concerned.  They had not heard anything in regard to it.  Why was the Department planning new schools while failing to improve existing schools?  That is the difficulty the school faced and is probably one that can be mirrored in other areas.  In terms of the optics, most schools cannot understand what is happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_802">The Department has given me some background information the Deputy may wish to hear which I will put on the record of the House.  The school in question is Scoil Chaithlín Maude.  It is a gaelscoil that shares a campus with two English medium primary schools, Knockmore Junior and Knockmore Senior.  The gaelscoil is housed in temporary accommodation and also has access to four surplus classrooms in the junior school.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">Scoil Caithlín Maude applied for grant aid to replace existing temporary accommodation in March of this year.  My officials met with the representatives of all three schools in June of this year to explore how the accommodation needs of Scoil Caithlín Maude, together with the other two schools, could be met on the existing site.  At the meeting Scoil Caithlín Maude indicated a preference for accommodation in an eight classroom separate building.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">Having considered the position of the three schools a possible solution, and I invite the Deputy to explore it, might entail a reconfiguration of the existing layout of all three schools.  However, the detail of how that might be achieved will need to be teased out with the schools concerned.  It is intended that further contact will be made with the school shortly.  The Deputy and I have now made contact on this matter and he might initiate that process.  The reply is on the record of the House.  If he wants further details I can give them to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_805">I appreciate the Minister's reply.  The school cannot keep up with the number of children trying to get into it.  The demand is huge.  It is ironic that the numbers are dropping off in some of the other schools in the area but the birth rate in the area has grown and the school cannot keep up in terms of streaming.  It is a success story and one we should reward.  We will examine the proposal in regard to reconfiguration the Minister referred to but there are major difficulties within the school.  There is huge support in the area for the school and no one wants to see it move out of that area.</p>

This allocation is assigned to eight subheads of which the schools building programme and investment in higher education are the largest.

In terms of the overall allocation 83% is assigned to the school building programme and at the end of October this programme was €5m ahead of profile.  The balance will be fully expended by year end.  I have also agreed with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the outturn for capital expenditure will be close to €530 million and that the increased capital expenditure will be funded by savings found elsewhere in my Department.</p>

The Minister and I debated in the past the value to the taxpayer of the summer works and minor works schemes.  I ask him to ensure that provision is made for the summer works and minor works schemes because all of us as public representatives, and the school community in general, have seen an excellent outturn for that State investment.  I have seen schools being refurbished and extended under the summer works scheme with a relatively small amount of grant aid.  Those schemes have given a terrific return and I appeal to the Minister to continue those schemes if at all possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">I understand what the Deputy is saying and support his sentiments but we are in a different place now.  We have the fastest growing birth rate in Europe.  In the first quarter of this year the population grew.  New infants born to this State amounted to 50 short of 20,000.  I have to start building almost immediately 20 new post-primary schools each of which will accommodate 1,000 pupils when completed.  We have to build 20 new primary schools of a scale that the Deputy would not be used to in Cavan.  I am talking about 600 and 700 pupils in a primary school.  We have to extend the existing accommodation provision in another 180 schools to meet this demographic demand, and I am not sure that we will have enough capital to do it.  I have argued strongly with my colleague in Cabinet that this is what we need and because we have had to focus on the demographic cohort which is increasing — good news for all of us — we must ensure there is a school place for every child in this State.  We cannot allow some children to remain outside the school system while we renovate and improve existing schools.  This is the hard choice I have had to make.  I would be pleased to discuss the matter in detail with the relevant committee of the Houses.</p>

The Minister must obtain a better return on taxpayers' money.  A better system for delivering new schools is available.  I am sure the Minister has available to him the prototype for delivery in regard to design.  Many of the unnecessary costs and blockages have been removed from the system in recent years, which is a welcome development.  There is no reason a 600 pupil primary school in north Dublin should not use the same design as a school in south Dublin, south Cork or any other major urban centre.  I hope all unnecessary costs are minimised and the best possible return is achieved in the provision of additional classroom capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_822">The Deputy may be interested to learn that since June of this year, when I became aware in discussions with senior officials of the scale of the demographic challenge we confront, the Department has completely changed the method of procurement and management.  We brought in additional assistance from other State agencies which had surplus professional capacity, for example, the now defunct National Building Agency, with which the Deputy may be familiar.  We are discussing with the vocational education committees the possibility that they will act as agents on the ground to deliver work.  There are excellent examples of this type of delivery in County Monaghan and I am sure Deputy Smith is familiar with them.  We must streamline and speed up the traditional form of procurement between the client, namely, the Department, the patron and the construction industry.  The traditional method is not sufficiently fast to deliver on the time lines with which we are confronted.  This is the reason I introduced the changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_827">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible for allocating special needs assistants, SNAs, to schools in accordance with my Department's policy.  Over the summer the NCSE has advised all mainstream schools of their SNA allocations in respect of valid applications received by 17 June.  The NCSE retained 475 out of the total 10,575 SNA posts available to allocate them to valid applications received since 17 June in respect of cases such as emergencies, appeals, acquired injuries or new school entrants with care needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The process of allocating these 475 retained posts has now begun.  Approximately 20 of the retained posts have already been allocated, bringing the total number of posts allocated to date to 10,120 for the current school year.  The NCSE has advised that it expects approximately 300 of the 475 retained posts to have been allocated to schools by the end of November.  A number of posts will be required to be retained for allocation during the remainder of the school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_829">I thank the Minister for providing an update on this important issue.  Some media commentary has been unfair to the Department and National Council for Special Education given the significant progress that has been made in providing special needs assistants.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, spoke in the House about the remarkable progress that has been made in this regard in the past 13 or 14 years.  The number of special needs assistants increased from 300 in 1997 to 10,575 in 2010-11.  This was much needed progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">Having had the opportunity to meet senior officials from the National Council for Special Education, I accept that the processing of applications is not straightforward and takes time.  I ask the Minister to ensure every effort is made to finalise the 300 additional appointments and have the relevant special needs assistants in classrooms by the end of the month.  I presume that when the first school term concludes, the profile of the classroom does not change much during the rest of the school year.  It may not be necessary, therefore, to retain 175 special needs assistants.  If there are applicants who meet the relevant criteria, the special needs assistant posts should be approved and the relevant SNAs allocated to the classroom.  I do not envisage much change in classroom profile between Christmas and the end of the school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">I am pleased the Deputy took the initiative and met officials from the National Council for Special Education.  The Department sets the policy and NCSE officials, who are the experts on the ground, deliver the instruments with which policy can be implemented.  I am advised by the NCSE that it is retaining 175 of the 10,575 special needs assistant posts.  I will speak to the council to determine whether it would be prudent to release a number of these retained posts.  Given that the total number of SNA posts is capped by the employment control framework, I will be advised by the need to retain a prudent number of posts.  A post that is available to be filled should not lie fallow.</p>

Details have been circulated to all Deputies.  Two weeks ago, I had an opportunity to hear a presentation given by Ms Brogan in which she painted a much bigger picture than that normally painted by individual schools or the parents and relatives of children with special needs.  It is not that the schools and parents do not give a comprehensive picture but that Ms Brogan paints a wider picture.  I suggest the relevant committee explore this issue with the National Council for Special Education once Members have availed of the opportunity to listen to Ms Brogan's presentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">Policy on rates of pay in the education sector forms part of wider public pay policy, including related commitments and reforms under the Croke Park agreement.  Of the employees to whom the Deputy refers, 89 are academic medical consultants.  Remuneration matters for medical consultants in the main falls within the remit of the Minister for Health.  The other ten posts fall into two groups.  The first are the four heads of level 1 universities.  The revised pay ceiling of €200,000 per annum will apply to future appointments to these posts.  The second group consists of six persons appointed under a framework provided for in section 25(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Universities Act 1997.  Remuneration in the case of these appointments is not subject to ministerial sanction and having regard to the Act a pay ceiling may not be imposed.  This framework is being reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The terms of the Government's pay ceiling will be imposed in the case of new appointees.  I have written to the chairpersons of the university governing bodies requesting them to ask those individuals who earn in excess of the pay ceiling of €200,000 to make voluntary waivers of salary.  Details of the methodology of how such voluntary waivers are to be effected were issued by my Department at the end of October 2011.  Given the short time since the arrangements were notified, it is reasonable to allow some time for this matter to be concluded.  I assure the Deputy that I am keen to ensure progress is made on this important issue in the coming period.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would be disappointed if there were no instant responses to the Minister's calls for volunteers on this issue.  I hope that people volunteer quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">I had an earlier question and the reply was somewhat different to the reply given by the Minister.  It states that under section 25(4) of the Universities Act 1997, the remuneration of fees, allowances and expenses paid to employees of universities require the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That differs from the Minister's reference to the section.  I can appreciate he may not have the detail with him, but perhaps he can check it.  There is a contradiction in the data that has been supplied to him.  I would like to see the cap enforced as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">Another issue that arises is the amount of class contact time for senior lecturers and academics in our higher education institutions.  Are there any proposals to ensure that more time is spent in the classroom in contact with the students by some of the senior academics?</p>

            <p eId="para_842">I will have that reference to section 25 followed up and will be in contact with the Deputy.  I do not have the exact information available to me.  I share the Deputy's view that highly paid academics who are engaged in much research work should also teach.  The ideal model expressed to me by the Irish Universities Association and by other professional educationalists is that a well qualified senior lecturer should combine research, teaching and work in the public community to a ratio of 40:40:20.</p>

Where sub-offices have been established, the employees in the VECs are anxious to know if this is a short-term measure.  When the time span of the Croke Park agreement is complete, will those employees be protected and remain in the newly established sub-offices?

            <p eId="para_850">I regret the delay in the process being put in place to identify and hire the 16 new CEOs who will head up the new local education and training boards.  Their role is central.  We have had some talks and I hope this matter will be completed as soon as possible.  When those 16 new CEOs are in place, it will be up to them to drive the process.  I know some Members were concerned or disappointed that there was no designated sub-office in their part of the constituency.  The only reason to have a designated sub-office was to ensure that the arrangements we were bringing into place with these 16 new entities would comply with the terms and conditions of the Croke Park agreement.  It is not an evaluation of the need for an educational office in a particular town or a particular part of the county.  For example, by locating the new head office of the Louth and Meath local education and training board in Drogheda, the head offices in Dundalk and Navan were within the 45 km distance so there was no need to designate a sub-office, but in some of the other areas there is such a need.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">This is being done purely for the purposes of implementing the rationalisation and integration of training boards in a manner that would make it compliant with the Croke Park agreement.

            <p eId="para_859">Under the terms of my Department's school transport scheme, a pupil with special educational needs is eligible for school transport if he or she is attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or a unit, that is or can be resourced to meet the child's special educational needs under Department of Education and Skills criteria.  While school transport applications for children with special educational needs are processed as expeditiously as possible, I understand that in instances where a new service is required, due to procurement procedures, it may take a number of weeks before a service can be established.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to talk to him about it.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">There have been several cases brought to my attention, probably due to the new school year.  Has the system become more convoluted?  I was speaking to someone in Bus Éireann who told me that the tendering process has become more complicated and agreed that the situation was less than satisfactory.  One child with special needs was waiting three months for the paperwork to be done.  Management at the school thought it had been sent and the SENO had looked after it.  If that parent had kept the child out of school for three months, the welfare board would be calling around.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">There seems to be a difficulty with the system itself.  I can give the Minister some examples of this.  Three months is too long a period to keep a child with special needs out of school.</p>

            <p eId="para_862">I mentioned earlier that I have asked for a code of practice to be introduced for the provision of school transport to children with special educational needs.  I hope that will help to expedite the process.  However, I wish to outline the process whereby a child with special educational needs secures a school transport service.  The application is completed by the parent and signed by the parent, the school principal and the special educational needs organiser prior to or at the time of first enrolment.  Those applications are forwarded by the SENO to the school transport section.  Bus Éireann is then requested to provide a report on the distance the child resides from the school of enrolment and the availability of a transport service.  Where a suitable service exists, the child may be added to this service.  This is a relatively straightforward process and should not take too long.  It takes considerably longer to establish a new service, as this may involve the contracting of an individual taxi, which must be tendered by Bus Éireann.  Other issues such as the need for wheelchair-accessible vehicles, special transport arrangements or an escort — which is the case for many children with special needs — and Garda vetting of drivers add to the length of time required to set up a new service.  Parents may also be offered a special transport grant to take their children to school themselves.  Each case is different and presents a unique set of complexities which must be addressed before a transport service can be finalised.  Setting up a completely new service is a pretty convoluted and complicated process.  However, if the Deputy knows of individual cases that he feels have taken an inordinately long time to process, I will undertake to examinethese.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">I can understand that a new service takes some time to be established, but what is an acceptable length of time in the Minister of State's opinion?  Is three months far too long?  It is from my point of view.  I can understand there are difficulties with resources and so on and that new services may have to be set up, but in the case with which I am familiar, there were five children in the same school having difficulties, and that was just one school.  There are other schools, I presume, that are having similar difficulties.  All I am asking is whether the Minister of State can investigate, through his officials, what the main difficulty is for Bus Éireann or whoever else is involved and whether there is a way of fast-tracking the establishment of such services.</p>

My sense is that as much streamlining as possible has already been carried out.  There is a significant amount of tendering for unique, tailored services responding to the needs of individual children, but the tendering process, by law, is a pretty convoluted one, and there are certain timeframes and periods of assessment that simply must be complied with.  They are feeding the delays in the process and there is nothing we can do about that.  I will undertake to liaise again with my officials to see whether any further streamlining can be achieved.</p>

The parents of the children affected and public representatives on the ground have not been able to meet the special educational needs organiser to discuss this situation, which has been ongoing since the month of June.  We have written, e-mailed and made requests, which have gone from pillar to post.  We are now approaching the month of December.  I find it unacceptable that someone in the public service is that unavailable to such a large number of people to discuss such a critical issue.  These are people who are dealing, unfortunately, with children with special needs, which is distressing enough.  They find the reduction in resources distressing, and not being able to meet the SENO is adding to that distress.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">There is no requirement for school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department.  My Department therefore does not maintain data in this regard.  Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have a code of behaviour.  The Act further requires that such a code be prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the National Education Welfare Board, which were issued to schools in 2008.  These state clearly that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying within the framework of its overall school code of behaviour and discipline.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">I have no plans to introduce any additional legislation as suggested by the Deputy.  I am, however, committed to supporting schools in tackling bullying, and it is for that reason that a wide range of supports are in place to assist schools in dealing with this important issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_872">While the Minister and I are here today exchanging questions and answers about education policy and legislation, there is a 15 year old child in my constituency who has been taught at home for the last two years because he has not been able to get back to school.  The Minister is familiar with the case because I sent the file over to him.  He has all the medical, psychological and psychiatric evidence of the damage that has been done to that child.  The parents have devoted their lives to efforts to get this matter resolved.  There was an incident between the school principal and the child.  The parents have been to the board of management, the National Education Welfare Service and the Department of Education and Skills, but nobody seems to be able to resolve this.  The problem is that the current system holds boards of management primarily responsible for standards in the school even if a complaint is made against a member of the board.  It is the equivalent of the police investigating the police.</p>

            <p eId="para_877">I am sure the Minister is aware that if there are cuts to teacher numbers and the pupil-teacher ratio goes up, this means more kids in classrooms in primary schools, but at secondary level it sometimes means that schools need to cut subjects.  One school in Dublin has had to drop its honours maths teacher and its art teacher.  Whatever way one looks at it, it seems a retrograde step to make honours maths and art unavailable in a school where they were previously available.  Kids may have been studying one of these for three years and, all of a sudden in year four and year five, it is no longer available.  Given that the Government is pretty keen to make sure we are progressive in the subjects we make available to students and that the future must involve an improvement in education facilities in order to benefit the workforce, does the Minister not think there should be some way of making sure schools do not lose particular subjects?  Is there any way of safeguarding this?</p>

The measures that will be enacted in schools after the budget will start in the autumn of next year rather than in the next school year, which starts in September 2012.

            <p eId="para_890">The key recommendations in the report, including bonus points for higher level mathematics, professional development for teachers and the roll-out of Project Maths, are being progressed.  Bonus points will be implemented from 2012.  Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 project schools which started the programme in 2008.  This is being supported by extensive investment in professional development for teachers which began in 2009 and which will continue until 2013 at least.  As part of this, intensive postgraduate courses will be developed aimed at teachers who do not hold a major qualification in mathematics.  A Project Maths implementation support group, an industry and education partnership, reported in 2010 on how stakeholders from business, second level and higher education can work together to achieve the objectives of Project Maths.  The recommendations of this report are being progressed.  My Department has also published the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is designed to promote a significant improvement in mathematical skills throughout primary and second level schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_892">One of the main recommendations related to bonus points.  From next year there will be 25 bonus points for mathematics.  There will also be a system of continuing professional development of teachers at primary and secondary level in the teaching of mathematics, including a professional masters degree and a part-time higher education diploma in mathematical education.  Consideration has been given to a four-year honours degree in mathematical education and, in addition, a tender for a postgraduate programme in mathematics will be finalised shortly, aimed at teachers who need extra support.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">A report was produced by National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSDL, a function of the University of Limerick.  It has carried out a good deal of work in this area and it is to be commended on the report completed under the tutelage of Dr. John O'Donoghue on the out-of-field teaching in post-primary education.  Project Maths is dealing with this in terms of continuing professional development.  The incentive of the 25 bonus points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, is being introduced in 2012 and it should have a positive bearing.  The fact that there will be continuous benchmarking and evaluation against the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results will be a true testament of whether we are getting results.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">There has been significant buy-in by teachers, parents and schools and the new junior cycle curriculum will feed in to greater outputs because the short courses devised as part of that will give students a greater chance to interact with industry.  For example, areas such as software programming, the pharmaceutical area and a host of other possibilities will engage their brains more laterally with mathematics and problem solving.  We must ensure that there is a good coterie of people who can think critically and laterally and who can solve problems in a more effectual way, the end result being better outcomes.  This is not to criticise the existing structures in place but we must continue to evolve mathematics learning in this country.</p>

Broughan — to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline to Dáil Éireann when he or his Department were last briefed by the Dublin City Manager on the latest developments with regard to Priory Hall, Dublin 13, and the ongoing severe difficulties for Priory Hall residents, who are living in emergency accommodation; if he will urgently ensure that any necessary additional funding and housing resources are put at the disposal of the Dublin City Manager to facilitate the appropriate re-housing of Priory Hall residents; whether he is taking any steps to address other serious problems in the north fringe development; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (12) Deputy Pat Deering — to comment on where the M7 and M9 motorways split at junction 11 since the M9 is for the south east and the principal towns and cities are Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford, yet the motorway signs for the final 2km only show Waterford, Kilkenny and Kilcullen and Carlow is not signalled until one has left the M7 but it too late by then since the decision has been made whether to leave the M7 and this has an negative effect on industry and tourism because people constantly miss their exit and there is no easy way back to the M9, which means most people will continue on the M7, and there is also a safety issue since it is known that some drivers who realised at the last minute that they had missed their turn pulled in on the hard shoulder and reversed back to the exit; (13) Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív — an gá atá ann go gcuirfear freagra dearfach ar fáil don iarratas atá deanta chuig an Roinn Comhshaoil, Pobail augs Rialtais Áitiúil le cead a fháil cuid de na haonaid tithíochta sóisialta ag Áras Rónáin, Cill Rónáin, Árann a athrú ó thithe sóisialta go haonad cúram príomhúil faoi chúram an HSE agus nach n-iarrfaí aon aisíoc ar an deontas a tugadh don ionad ó tharla go mbeidh sé in úsáid ag an HSE (aisíneacht stáit) don phobal, to consider the application made to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for permission for some of the social housing units at Kilronan House, Kilronan, Aran, to transition from social housing to primary care units of the HSE and for any repayment of the grant to be given to the centre since it will be used by the HSE, a state agency, for the public; (14) Deputy Joan Collins — the issue of appointments to State boards in light of the fact that 20 individuals with links to the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party have been appointed to State boards since the Government took office; (15) Deputies Brian Stanley, Charles Flanagan and Billy Kelleher — the closure of St. Brigid's Hospital, Shaen, and the proposed closure of Abbeyleix Community Nursing Home, County Laois; (16) Deputy Joe Costello — the need to establish an independent body to hold tenants' deposits on rented accommodation (17) Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh — the need to reverse the cuts in funding to services responding to the drugs problem in Dublin; (18) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett — fears about possible postgraduate grant cuts and increased undergraduate registration fees; (19) Deputy Mick Wallace — given pre-election promises to end feather-bedding and the commitment in the programme for Government to cut back political cronyism, if the Government will explain to the House why it has installed large numbers of people with party links to State boards since entering office; (20) Deputy Robert Troy — to ask the Minister for Defence to discuss the Cabinet's decision yesterday to close the Army barracks in Mullingar, Clonmel and Cavan; (21) Deputy Bernard J. Durkan — the impending closure of St. Brigid's Home, Crooksling, with consequences for patients and staff, the fact that neither patients nor staff received any forewarning regarding the reasons for the closure, particularly in the wake of the 2009 HIQA report which resulted in extra expenditure bringing the nursing home up to the required standard, if the Minister has sought background information regarding the proposal with particular reference to the intended relocation of the facility which is likely to result in extra expenditure as opposed to cost savings, why an examination of any further expenditure required at St. Brigid's was not undertaken and balanced against the extra costs associated with relocation and inconvenience to patients, and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter; and (22) Deputy Regina Doherty — to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, if he will consider introducing a mechanism and guidelines for local authorities to connect single residences in rural areas to the mains sewage systems which are maintained by local authorities in light of the recent Water Service (Amendment) Bill 2011, which will introduce mandatory registration and inspection of more than 440,000 septic tanks in Ireland beginning in the early 2013 since the purpose of this proposal is to enable those residents who are interested in connecting their homes to a mains sewage system would have the ability to do so and since this proposal would be in addition to the current group sewage scheme already available at local level and the cost of connection would be borne by the single interested householder.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_423">
            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_899">I welcome the opportunity afforded to me by this debate to highlight the need for stigma-reducing and mental health education in schools.  As a country we must ensure that our children and young people leave schools with the tools they need to look after their mental health and the knowledge that there is no shame in discussing mental health or in looking for help from the various professionals best placed to provide it.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">I welcome the commitment of the Government to continue to invest in our mental health services and to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  As we work to establish more community-based mental health services, a great deal has been made of the need to break down the stigma surrounding mental health issues in our society.  We must work to prevent new stigmas from forming as well.  Young people experiencing mental health problems are at exactly the same, if not a greater, risk of rejection, damage to self-esteem and a reluctance to seek support as their adult counterparts.  It is vital that we do everything we can to introduce children in an age-appropriate fashion to positive mental health education and stigma-reducing programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">I have spoken in the House previously about the contrast between the way we teach children about their mental health and the way they learn about the basics of dental health.  We teach our children from the youngest age in schools about the damage that sweets and fizzy drinks can do to their teeth.  We teach them how to prevent dental problems.  We discuss the tools they need and the importance of brushing their teeth morning and night.  We discuss the need for regular visits and check-ups and the fact that there is no shame in a toothache.  We should use our schools to teach children the fundamental tools they will need to look after their mental health using exactly the same method we use to teach them how to protect and mind aspects of their physical health.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">We can learn from our international colleagues and neighbours on this issue.  For example, in Scotland, following a successful two-year pilot programme, the positive mental health attitudes curriculum has been adopted by the education department.  Children are given the opportunity to engage with mental health in the classroom and to discuss issues that may affect them with their teachers and peers.  Since this is now a national curriculum, teachers have been provided with lesson suggestions, worksheets and a DVD of anecdotal scenarios to highlight mental health issues that young people and their friends and family members may be experiencing.  At a basic level, the inclusion of this subject as part of a national curriculum would ensure that all children receive the same message on mental health from their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The answer I often receive from the Department of Education and Skills is that social, personal and health education is part of the junior cycle but this is not adequate.  The subject touches on emotional well-being only in a broad sense.  The reality is that one in four people in the country experience mental health difficulties at some stage in their lives.  Their challenges have been kept behind closed doors for too long in this country and we have seen the negative consequences of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">We must have a more specifically targeted programme to ensure young people leave school empowered with the tools required.  This is nothing new and it is recommended in the Government's policy, A Vision for Change.  It is also recommended and fleshed out in some detail by See Change, the national mental health stigma reduction partnership.  There should be a willingness to recognise that this is about more than simply resources when we are discussing mental health.  It is about a culture and how we can knit the promotion of positive mental health throughout the schools.  We have a captive audience sitting in classrooms throughout the island on a daily basis and we must ensure that teaching time and the classrooms are used as the powerful tools they can be to reduce stigma and to give people the tools to promote positive mental health.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_905">I take this topical issue debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  I thank Deputy Harris for raising this important issue.  Schools play a vital role in reducing the stigma surrounding mental health issues and mental health education features strongly in the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme has been a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health.  It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory.  Its aim is to foster the personal development, health and well-being of children, to help them create and maintain supportive relationships and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.  It includes relationships and sexuality education.  In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme at senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">The curriculum at primary level includes such issues as self awareness; relationships and sexuality education, feelings and emotions, making decisions, relating to others, communications resolving conflict and dealing with bullying.  These themes are continued at post primary level, where SPHE is presented in ten modules covering self management, communication skills, relationships and sexuality, belonging and integrating, emotional health and influences and decisions, physical health, substance use and personal safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach, supported by the pastoral care structures in schools and good parental links.  A report was published in 2009 based on inspection of SPHE in 40 primary schools.  It showed many extremely positive findings, including high levels of satisfaction from parents that their children's social and personal development were being promoted in schools, that their confidence and self esteem was supported and that they were encouraged to behave well and take responsibility for their actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Inspectors found in most classrooms pupils were encouraged to voice their opinions and interact positively with others.  They displayed a good understanding of the SPHE content they had covered and considered themselves to be thoughtful about the feelings of others.  Very high proportions of students considered themselves to be happy in schools and the report found feelings and emotions were addressed regularly in SPHE lessons.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students.  The service includes the provision of individual guidance and counselling for students at critical stages in their education or times of personal crisis.  Psychologists from my Department's national educational psychological service, NEPS, are present in schools across the country and provide a range of supports.  These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  The NEPS also encourages the development of structures among teachers and schools care teams which link with the relevant local HSE mental health services.  Schools are playing their part within the resources available to promote positive mental health among students.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_911">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  While I welcome the provision of SPHE within our school system it is limited.  We recognised that as a country when we brought together partners working in this area from the sea change initiative and the Government policy A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">One of the issues with SPHE, apart from the fact that it is a broad subject, is that we need to examine how to tackle the issue of stigma and stigma reduction at a much younger age.  There is an opportunity to build on a programme called Zippy's Friends which is already delivered to primary school children in first and second class.  We could consider rolling out scenarios in an age appropriate fashion.  The problem is about stigma and culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">It is not long ago, relative to others, since I was in primary and secondary school and it was not normal to see a child with special needs in school.  As a country we have changed our attitude to special needs and disabilities.  Mental health is the next big challenge for our education system and culture is a factor.  I ask the Minister of Stage to revert to his officials and ask them to consider examining best practice in other places, particularly in regard to what I cited in Scotland.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">It is clear that what we are doing is not working.  While there might be positive steps we know as a country a huge body of work needs to be done in regard to mental health.  I know the Government is committed and I am fully supportive of the measures it is taking in that regard but we have to think outside the box and realise that the days of giving the age old answer of SPHE as a solution is not enough.  We have to go further than that.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The term "knitted" is important.  The issue needs to be addressed across our curriculum and subjects.  The language used by teachers and the environment of a school has to discuss on a regular basis the issues people are experiencing in their homes which for far too long were not discussed in this country.  We have a huge opportunity to use our schools while educating students to tackle issues regarding culture and stigma.  I urge the Minister of State to take the opportunity to do that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" eId="spk_426" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_916">I share many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harris.  He is correct in saying that in the past a major stigma has been attached to mental health issues in this country and where better to address that than in our education system.  In making our children more environmentally aware we have succeeded in making them the environmental wardens or lieutenants of our country through the green schools programme.  We could achieve something similar in reducing the stigma associated with mental health problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The resource programme introduced in October 2010 entitled Working Things Out through SPHE was launched to support teachers in the delivery of the mental health promotion dimension of the SPHE programme.  It demonstrates case studies of young people who have successfully managed a variety of difficulties, including bullying, bereavement, depression, easing problems, obsessive compulsive disorder and feelings of anger, fear and anxiety.  Our response is beginning to happen, although I agree with Deputy Harris that one could never argue we have a perfect system in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">It is always important to look to best practice in other jurisdictions.  I will undertake to work with my officials and if the Deputy submits more detail of the Scottish programme I could undertake to consider it.  He is correct to point out that we need to, as he described it, knit this sort of provision across the whole school programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">In this country we are providing literacy solutions to resolve literacy problems among our adult learners by incorporating literacy solutions into all of the further education provisions across a number of different courses and training provisions.  We need to engender a cultural change which will bring the issue of mental health and the stigma associated with it in the past to the fore.  If Deputy Harris wants to liaise directly with me, we could examine best practice abroad and determine how we can incorporate some aspects into a provision in the future.</p>

          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_427">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_920">Amidst the discourse on the economic crisis the drugs crisis has been forgotten.  It would be wrong for that to happen given the new report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  It is a stark reminder of how serious Ireland's drug problem is and the horrific consequences of the failures of successive Governments to make sufficient funding available.  The report should serve as a wake-up call to the Government and all Members of this House of this crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">Comparative research by the European centre found Ireland has the worst heroin problem, the second worst ecstasy problem and the third worst cocaine problem in the whole of Europe.  We also have the second highest rate of drug induced deaths.  At 70 deaths per million the figure is more than three times the EU average.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">That amounts to almost one death per day.  Moreover, it is most likely an underestimation.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">These statistics clearly demonstrate the need to afford greater resources to drug prevention, treatment and rehabilitation projects rather than reducing them.  Chronic underfunding has historically been a feature of the State's response to the drugs crisis.  Despite this, drugs services have already been subject to disproportionate cuts since the beginning of the recession.  It is not just the Fianna Fáil Government which is responsible for these disproportionate cuts; the current Government is also introducing cuts in these areas.  Health Service Executive funding for numerous drugs projects in Dublin has been reduced by 5% for the final quarter of this year, with a promise of further reductions next year.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, has made a complaint to the HSE in this regard.  That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The Government must take ownership of and drive forward the State's response to the drugs crisis.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, resigned his office because of the closure of a local Army barracks.  I am talking about the avoidable deaths of more than 300 people per year.  Does the Minister stand over the 5% cut already imposed by the HSE this year?  What action will he take to ensure there are no further cuts?  Schemes which have experienced cutbacks include the Inchicore needle exchange, which was shut down last year, and the Rialto early morning methadone clinic.  Services such as these save lives and aid rehabilitation by facilitating participation in education and work.  By doing so, they also save the Government money.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">Reductions in these services will lead to higher rates of drug abuse and a higher incidence of mortality.  The Government is putting great effort into convincing the public that cuts to essential services are necessary and that there is no alternative.  That is not the case.  I urge the Minister to examine the alternative set out in Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission, which we presented to Government yesterday.  It clearly shows that front line services can be protected and that there is an alternative.  There must be a greater urgency in addressing the drugs crisis.</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_428">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_926">It is important to note that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, depends on individual countries to supply it with figures on drug use.  Two issues arise in this regard, namely, the quality of information supplied and the timeliness of such information.  The EMCDDA report is historic rather than current.  The Irish content on prevalence in the 2011 report is based on the 2006-2007 drugs prevalence survey.  This was an all-island survey prepared by the national advisory committee on drugs and was carried out to the highest standards.  Not all contributors to the EMCDDA would have similar comprehensive prevalence surveys on which to base their figures.  The drugs prevalence survey is carried out on a four-year cycle and the 2010-2011 report will be launched next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">I acknowledge that we have had a problem of heroin use in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, for some years.  Significant steps are being taken through the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 to address this issue.  An Garda Síochána and the Revenue's customs service continue to prioritise their efforts to reduce the supply of drugs into Ireland and the production of drugs within the country.  The further development of prevention measures aimed primarily at those deemed to be most at risk of becoming involved in illegal drug use, and at the younger population generally, is a critical element of the national drugs strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">There are approximately 14,500 known opiate users in Ireland, of whom 9,300 are in receipt of methadone treatment.  In total, more than 12,500 people are in receipt of drug treatment.  Clients can usually access methadone provision in Dublin within one month of assessment.  The major focus recently has been on increasing the availability of services outside Dublin.  In the past 18 months, for example, additional services have been put in place in Limerick, Tralee, Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford and Dundalk.  Increased detoxification facilities have also come on stream recently in counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.  The roll-out of needle exchange services in approximately 65 community pharmacies at various locations outside Dublin began in October.  Needle exchange services in Dublin are provided through HSE clinics and voluntary sector providers.  This initiative will facilitate broad national coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">I am particularly focused on ensuring there is an increased emphasis on moving people on from drug treatment to a drug-free life, where that is achievable.  Apart from the obvious benefits to those concerned, this will open up more treatment opportunities, allowing us to encourage more people into treatment.  The EMCDDA notes that we have adopted "imaginative responses" in addressing the problem of new psychoactive substances and have had greater impact in dealing with this aspect of drug use.  As a result of the prompt actions taken, the number of headshops has reduced from 102 to 12 and psychoactive substances are not for sale in any of these outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">On drug mortality, Ireland reports the third highest rate after Estonia and Norway and is just ahead of the UK figure.  However, it is acknowledged that the figures from Ireland, compiled through the Health Research Board's national drugs-related deaths index, are very accurate.  This index combines information from four sources, namely, coroners' records, the hospital inpatient inquiry scheme, the central treatment list and the general mortality register.  Drug death figures in most European countries are based on general mortality register records only.  Nevertheless, the number of deaths arising from drugs misuse is of great concern and underlines the importance of tackling the drugs problem in a comprehensive way.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">I am surprised by the Minister's response.  Is he denying that cuts are being imposed which are affecting people in the communities worst affected by the drugs scourge?  Is he denying the death rate?  As I said, that figure is most likely an underestimation.  For instance, it tends only to include those who die of overdoses, while excluding deaths arising more indirectly from drug misuse, such as in road accidents.  Is the Minister claiming that the level of drug abuse is not as bad as indicated in this report?  The reality is that in many communities — not only in Dublin but throughout the State, in Portlaoise, Cork, Waterford and elsewhere — the drugs problem is getting much worse.  Consequently, there is a need for greater resources, not fewer.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">It is not too late to address the problem.  Will the Minister offer a renewed commitment to the national drugs strategy?  Will he undertake to reverse cuts that have been made and to protect the sector from further cuts in budget 2012?  In particular, will he renew the commitment to drugs taskforces — the infrastructure upon which the drugs strategy is based — throughout the country?  Some Government Deputies have been less than supportive of their local taskforces, which serves to undermine the network of support they offer.  The Department of Education and Skills has abandoned the taskforces in many areas.  If that is allowed to happen, what is to stop other statutory agencies withdrawing from the taskforces?</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The drugs strategy mechanisms which bring together the relevant stakeholders and actors, including the community, service providers and State bodies, are regarded as an example of best practice in this area.  Will the Minister reaffirm the Government's commitment to this multifaceted system?  Will he take concrete steps to guarantee funding for schemes such as the Rialto early morning methadone clinic and the Inchicore needle exchange which have been closed as a consequence of HSE cutbacks?</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_934">I have acknowledged the number of deaths and that it is of great concern to us.  I am underscoring the accuracy of our figures as we take them from four different sources whereas as other jurisdictions only use one, the general mortality register.  I mentioned that the information is from 2006-07.  There has been a reduction of €74,000 to community drugs projects supported by the HSE in the Dublin and mid-Leinster region arising form the implementation of cost-saving measures across hospitals and community services.  No such reductions are envisaged in the other HSE regions and no reduction is being made in the funding provided through the Department of Health in the current year.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The Government is committed to dealing with the scourge of drugs in our community.  I have highlighted how the legislation on head shops has been updated to make a further list of psychoactive substances illegal and how successful the legislation has been in reducing the number of head shops.  I assure the House from the notes handed to me that no psychoactive substances are available in those that are open.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Of course, the war on drugs will continue, with the involvement of law-enforcement and customs officers.  We will endeavour to have more effective treatments.  I am not happy with the numbers of people who come off methadone and I am reviewing that situation.  I certainly want it reflected in any new contracts given to doctors who are treating people currently on methadone.</p>

            <p eId="para_938">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for taking this issue so promptly.  The closure of the facility at Shaen is a double whammy for County Laois.  It is a devastating blow, coming as it does less than two weeks after the announcement of the closure of a similar facility at Abbeyleix, only 14 or 15 miles down the road.  It is a black day for the health services in County Laois and the midlands in general.  The only public nursing home in the county that is not under threat, in Mountmellick, already has closed wards.  The proposed closure of the facilities at Abbeyleix and Shaen removes 70 out of the 200 public nursing home beds in the county at a time when there is an increasing demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">In the past week I have tried to access services for someone in need of such a bed.  This is happening under the Minister's watch.  I heard him say that that he would grab the reins of the health services and would not allow the HSE to continue to flounder along.  In the eight months since coming to power, the Minister has set about the destruction of public nursing home facilities in the county in which I live.  During previous recessions these fine facilities in Shaen and Abbeyleix were kept open.  However, the difference now is that the two parties in government are continuing with the disastrous policies of the previous Government——</p>

            <p eId="para_946">There is a crisis in the provision of long-term care in County Laois as evidenced by the second closure of a long-established unit in as many weeks.  I must comment on the antics of Deputy Seán Fleming yesterday.  He knows that his party contributed to the crisis in the county by dint of years of underinvestment in facilities when we had money.  The hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil is breathtaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">That said, I want this issue resolved.  How does the HSE propose to reduce the number of beds from almost 300 five years ago to a mere 130 today?  It is a crisis and we cannot expect the county to be denuded of institutional care for the elderly when at least 4% of the community have a requirement for such services.  Why is County Laois being targeted for repeated closures?  If these closures proceed, I ask the Minister to commit to reopening the closed wards at the sole remaining long-term residential care facility in the county at Mountmellick, where, as Deputy Stanley has said, scores of beds have been taken out of commission under Fianna Fáil.  I want the Minister to commit to reinstating these beds, opening up that hospital and more than anything else providing quality long-term care for elderly people in County Laois.</p>

So far all we have had are reports from HIQA recommending closure in some cases and in cases where HIQA has not recommended a closure, budgetary constraints are being used as a reason.  Clearly there is a crisis in public long-term nursing home care throughout the country.  However, closing two facilities in County Laois in a few weeks rips the heart from the community.  The Deputies in the House along with Deputy Seán Fleming have conveyed that adequately without me needing to add more to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">Suggesting that they are fine facilities when one is a 1932-built sanatorium beggars belief.  Fine people are working there and fine people are being cared for there.  However, to describe the facility as fine is stretching imagination and HIQA would take a very different view.  In answer to Deputy Kelleher, I say that we all know why we have the crisis we have.  Abbeyleix Community Nursing Home provides continuing care, day care and respite services to people in Laois, Offaly and bordering areas of Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary and Kildare.  While it might suit the purposes of the Deputies opposite to say it is closing, it is not closing.  The long-term residential bed element is moving, but the day-care services are staying and will indeed be expanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">St. Brigid's Hospital, Shaen, Portlaoise, is a two-storey building that was originally opened as a TB sanatorium in 1932 and is now a 28-bed residential community nursing unit with two respite beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The Health Service Executive is facing major challenges across all services owing to a reduction in funding allocation. This, together with staff losses as a result of the public sector moratorium and the anticipated loss of staff between now and the end of the year make it essential that it move to consolidate the overall provision of long stay care within the Dublin and mid-Leinster region.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The HSE has also advised that the physical infrastructures of both facilities are totally unsuitable for a modern service.  It believes that without a rebuild it would not be possible to provide adequate care for the residents at these locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Taking all these factors together, the HSE took the decision to proceed with closure of both facilities. The HSE is committed to a full and meaningful consultation process with the residents and families through this difficult time.  It will also consult and communicate with staff, public representatives and key people in the wider community.  Staff will be transferred to reopen beds and-or prevent the closure of other public beds resulting from moratorium losses in the area.  The HSE will ensure this transition process is managed professionally for the residents.  Every effort will be made to minimise disruption to them and to ensure that long term relationships with fellow residents and staff will be maintained to the greatest extent possible.  In addition, liaison persons have been appointed to support the residents through the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">I would like to assure the Deputies that no service users will be placed in a more costly financial position in terms of their care.  In regard to the other services provided at Abbeyleix CNU, I can confirm that the day care service will continue to cater for the needs of the 90 clients, approximately 24 per day, who use the service and there are plans to further enhance this service in the future.  Respite service for the current eight clients at Abbeyleix will continue.  However, it is intended that this service will transfer to a private provider following consultation with the families concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I can also assure the House that the primary care centre located on the grounds of the Abbeyleix facility will also continue in line with the HSE primary care strategy.  The changes to service I have outlined will help to ensure that the HSE achieves the highest standards of care for all residents affected.</p>

These are fine facilities, both of which have been providing good care for people.  I ask the Minister to meet with Members from the area and representatives of the staff to discuss the reasons for closure and how we can rescue this situation.

            <p eId="para_977">Excellent care is being provided in both facilities, of that there is no question.  However, the facilities are not up to the standard described by Deputies.  On Deputy Stanley's remarks in regard to the Mater Hospital, some €200 million is currently being spent on refurbishing the core of the old hospital.  The facilities of which we are speaking, which were built during the 1930s as sanatoria, were not built to last the duration of time they have been in use.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has strong views in this regard, which will come to the fore in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Given the cost of refurbishing these facilities, it would be more cost effective to knock them down and rebuild them.  I have been assured by the HSE — it is important the families are aware of this — that all patients in the Abbeyleix facility who wish to do so will be able to stay together and retain their community relationships.  I acknowledge and accept that this facility has been home to people for a long time, that relationships have grown and that moving is stressful.  We aim to minimise that stress.  The facilities to which these people will be moved will be modern and well run.  People wishing to stay together will be able to do so.  They will have a choice.  There will be consultation with them and their relatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Similar options will be made available to people residing in the facility at Shaen.  We want to give people plenty of time to come to terms with this.  As I have stated nothing can happen within six months and people can move within that time if they so choose.  However, there will be plenty of time for people to consider this.  The reality is that once a communication is made with patients or staff the information is out in the public arena, following which public representatives from the Opposition try to make as much hay as they can of it.  That may suit their purpose but it does not help——</p>

            <p eId="para_983">On Deputy Flanagan's questions, the HSE is a provider and commissioner of services.  On the long term care issue, I will look into the position in regard to the unit in Portlaoise.  As I understand it, beds in the Mountmellick unit will be staffed by the staff freed up as a result of the closure of the other facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">There appears to be some misinformation about.  Using the 2006 census, the requirement in terms of the number of beds recommended for over 65s is 4.5%.  This means there needs to be 45 beds per thousand for people aged over 65.  This means there should be 744 long term care beds in the Laois-Offaly area.  There are currently approximately 790 beds, public and private, excluding Shaen Hospital and the Abbeyleix Community Nursing Home in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">We will use all the facilities open to us.  We want people to be cared for in modern conditions of a standard of which we can be proud while equally respecting people's right to stay together based on the relationships they have formed.  Staff at Shaen Hospital will also have the option of moving so that there will be minimal disruption to patients.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_989">This issue has been a running sore for a long time, namely, the withholding of the deposits of tenants in private rented accommodation.  While this problem has been around for many decades nothing has been done to address it.  The problem arises because very often landlords retain tenants' deposits or part thereof, often on spurious grounds such as damage to property, unpaid utility bills or a failure of the tenant to pay all rental income on time and so on.  This is the largest issue of complaint by tenants to Threshold, which published its annual report last week, and the Private Rented Tenancies Board, PRTB.  Threshold and the PRTB say they have a 75% success rate when they take up this issue with landlords.  In other words, when representation is made and pressure is applied to the landlords, they acknowledge that perhaps they should not have retained the full deposit or part thereof.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">This is a running sore and it is also a serious matter for people in the Dublin area where rents have not decreased even though house prices have decreased significantly, by 50%.  Nearly all rental accommodation suitable for a couple or a family with a child or two, costs in the region of €800 to €1,200 a month.  A person on rent supplement allowance will not receive this amount from the community welfare officer.  A student, for example, who does not get back the deposit is unable to meet the cost of a fresh deposit.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">An independent structure is required and this has been a recommendation for some time.  An independent body could be the PRTB or a local authority or another third party.  This body could hold the deposits paid rather than the landlords holding them.  A deposit does not belong to the landlord but rather it belongs to the tenant.  There should be an independent body in place to receive the deposit so that when the tenant moves on, it would adjudicate on whether some part of the deposit should be retained by the tenant or given to the landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">I ask the Minister to recognise the serious grievance of so many people.  Hundreds of thousands of people live in rented accommodation.  I ask that the necessary legislation be introduced to set up such an independent, third party body to retain deposits.</p>

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_471">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">Before I reply to Deputy Costello on the housing matter, I wish to take the opportunity to acknowledge the work of Deputy Willie Penrose as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government since 9 March 2011.  I thank him for his outstanding work and the interest and knowledge he had of housing matters in particular and the principled position he took on a particular issue.  I had an excellent working relationship with him which I deeply appreciate and I wish him well.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector.  My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 and the incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in the review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention.  In July 2011, the Government approved the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011.  The general scheme of the Bill proposes the introduction of fines where a landlord is found to have incorrectly retained a tenant's deposit, as a first step to eliminating the problem of deposit retention.  My Department is currently liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the drafting of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The programme for Government commits to the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and it is important that action in this regard is taken in the context of a strong evidence base.  I have therefore asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which is the independent statutory body charged with the administration of the Act, to commission cost benefit analysis-based research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations.  I understand that the research will be put out to tender in the coming weeks and I expect that the board will revert to me with detailed research and recommendations by summer 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Previous research on this topic by the PRTB has engaged in comparative examination of schemes existing in a number of other countries but has not included any detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of establishing a deposit protection scheme in Ireland.  In line with the regulatory impact analysis guidelines for a proposal of this scale, a detailed cost benefit analysis of how a deposit protection scheme might be applied to the existing Irish system, and the costs arising, should be the initial action.  Any new scheme must be integrated into the Residential Tenancies Act.  It should be linked to the registration function of the PRTB, and perhaps also to minimum rental accommodation standards.  The purpose of this further research is to identify what type of scheme could best suit the Irish market and its costs and operational implications.  This will then enable me to make a definitive, evidence-based, recommendation to Government on this matter in due course.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_472">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_997">I thank the Minister for his reply and I am pleased that the matter is being progressed by the Government.  I hope there will be no delay because there have been complaints for decades.  The situation is dire in many cases.  I regularly receive complaints at my clinics.  Tenants complain that the landlord retains a substantial portion of the deposit.  In one case, the landlord retained €500 out of the deposit of €800 on the basis of wear and tear to the apartment.  This is very much a moveable feast and it is very difficult to verify wear and tear over a period of time.  The current rules as regulated by the PRTB are not sufficiently tight to allow for proper criteria or verification.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The only way to deal with this issue is by way of an independent mechanism.  Rules and regulations alone are not satisfactory.  I am not in favour of establishing another quango of any description.  Local authorities deal with a large body of tenants and they would be best qualified to deal with private rental deposits or, failing that, the PRTB which is the regulatory body, should be responsible.  I hope the process being undertaken by the Minister can be conducted without delay and a structure will be in place in the not too distant future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_999">I assure Deputy Costello that I am not happy at there being too many quangos.  I have demonstrated this view in recent times.  The Government is committed to solving this problem.  The programme for Government, the statement on housing approved by the Government at the instigation of Deputy Penrose and the Government's recent housing policy statement which was published in July, all clearly indicate that the rental market will be of increasing importance to the citizen because the capital moneys are no longer available to build local authority housing.  The private rented residential market will be coming under scrutiny and will be included in the regulatory framework in the future.  The research to which I referred will consider both the security and the insurance-based approaches to the scheme.  We will see what are the costs and the operational structures required within the PRTB and the legislative implications arising.  I assure the Deputy it is a Government priority.  I hope the research will be available on time by mid-2012 and that we will be able to proceed with the implementation of the recommendations before the year is out.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1000">Before the sos I referred to the 12 part mini-series, "Titanic: Blood and Steel".  This series is produced by Paul Myler for EPOS Films with the Italian DeAngelis group and it will provide approximately 200 jobs for Irish cast and crew.  The series will focus on the designing and building of <i>Titanic</i> before its fateful first voyage.  The 100-strong cast includes international names such as Neve Campbell, who appeared in “Scream” and “Wild Things”; Chris Noth, who appeared in “Sex and the City” and “The Good Wife”; Kevin Zegers who appeared in “Dawn of the Dead”; Derek Jacobi who appeared in “Gladiator”, along with a strong Irish cast including Liam Cunningham, who appeared in “The Guard” and “The Wind that Shakes the Barley”; Ian McElhinney, who appeared in “Game of Thrones”; Michael McElhatton, who appeared in “Perrier’s Bounty” and “Spin the Bottle”; Martin McCann, who appeared in “Killing Bono”, and many others.  This film has an all-star cast and I am confident it will be very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The Irish Film Board incentivises expenditure in the regions of Ireland through regional support funding.  From 2006 to 2010, for example, this funding contributed €3 million to 30 productions, with cumulative regional Irish expenditure totalling €18 million.  This funding is now awarded based on the number of shoot days in the regional location.  Counties that have benefited from hosting Irish Film Board film and television productions in recent years include counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Offaly, Galway, Cork and Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The first Bollywood blockbuster to shoot in Ireland, "Ek Tha Tiger", starring two of Bollywood's biggest stars, was filmed on location in Dublin over five weeks recently.  It was estimated that the production contributed €1.5 million to the Irish economy and created more than 1,000 short-term jobs, with many Irish cast and crew involved in the shoot.  The film used an abundance of Dublin locations for spectacular dance sequences and stunts.  These included Trinity College,  the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Liffey quays, South King Street, Mount Street, the Shelbourne Hotel, Temple Bar and St. Stephen's Green.  The film is to be distributed to 24 countries, thereby providing that images of Ireland and Dublin will be projected on the big screen across the globe, especially to new untapped demographic cohorts such as India's burgeoning middle and upper classes as well as the Indian diaspora throughout the world.  This will provide promotional opportunities for Tourism Ireland to exploit Ireland as a tourism destination.  According to Fáilte Ireland figures, 20% of all tourists who visited Ireland in 2010 did so because of images of the country they saw on film.  This factor has increased considerably in importance.  Not long ago only 2% gave this as a reason for visiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The Irish Film Board, with Government support, has adopted a strategic approach to meeting these challenges.  Through its varied schemes and programmes it aims to assist projects at the earliest stage of development, throughout the pre-production phase and eventually to production and post-production stages.  In addition, through its funding of Screen Training Ireland the board addresses the needs of the industry at the entry level, with more than 500 people receiving training in all aspects of the film-making process each year.  In this way training supports can be put in place to match the requirements of the market place and render its participants relevant to the sector they want to enter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">This clearly demonstrates a long-term commitment by the Government to the Irish audio-visual industry.  The industry is a very important one with substantial levels of employment and significant inward investment.  The Irish audio-visual content production sector review, prepared for the Irish Film Board and published in December of 2008, established the 2007 value of the audio-visual production sector in Ireland at over €500 million, with direct employment figures of 6,000.  An earlier survey identified that in 1992 direct employment was 1,000.  This demonstrates an industry that has grown very significantly and which has the potential to grow even further with the correct nurturing and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The significant challenge now is to continue to provide as supportive an environment as is possible.  The audio-visual industry is smart in that it combines tradition with the advent of each new technology — it is about tradition, translation and transmission.  The sector provides natural alliances between education and culture and is, therefore, uniquely positioned to lead, contribute to and enhance the smart economy.  In that regard, I recently published a five-year strategy for the sector, Creative Capital: Building Ireland's Audiovisual Creative Economy.The report arose as a second phase to the Irish audio-visual content production sector review, to which I referred.  This report will deliver on issues regarding talent development, convergence, sectoral growth, education and digital opportunities for Ireland, as well as reporting on industry leadership, State agency roles and innovation.  It will provide a road map for coming years and will assist in enabling the domestic audio-visual content production sector to develop into an internationally based sector for product and services over the five year period 2011 to 2015 and increase employment levels to 10,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Success in recent few years at film festivals and award ceremonies is one measure that confirms that policy in this area is working.  The year 2010 was a great one for Irish film-making, with Irish talent picking up awards and nominations and some of the industry's highest accolades.  Highlights include the Irish film industry receiving five Academy Award nominations, three of these being for the IFB supported films, "The Secret of Kells", "Granny O'Grimm's Sleeping Beauty" and "The Door".  In addition, the Irish animator Richard Baneham and his team picked up the Oscar for Best Visual Effects for his work on "Avatar".  Other highlights include "All Good Children" being selected for the prestigious directors' fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival, "His &amp; Hers" picking up a prize for excellence in cinematography at the Sundance festival and Irish films being selected for some of the world's most renowned festivals including Toronto, Tribeca, Edinburgh and London.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Highlights for home grown production in 2011 include Rebecca Daly's "The Other Side of Sleep", which has been selected for the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival as well as for the directors' fortnight at Cannes in 2011, and Thaddeus O'Sullivan's "Stella Days", starring Martin Sheen.  International film productions which filmed in 2010 included the major US feature film, "Haywire", directed by Steven Soderbergh, "Albert Nobbs", selected for the Toronto International Film Festival and starring Glenn Close in what many judge to be an Oscar-worthy performance and Paolo Sorrentino's  "This Must Be The Place", starring Sean Penn, which was selected for official competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">In tandem with supports for the Irish Film Board, my Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector scheme relates to the administration of elements of the section 481 tax relief scheme.  In 2010 a total of 57 projects — up from 44 projects in 2009 —  were approved for funding through section 481, with an Irish spend of €164.65 million.  These 57 projects supported substantial employment for crew, cast and extras and had the effect of maintaining and creating jobs in a very difficult climate while at the same time producing a product that will help to sell Ireland abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">To date in 2011, a total of 38 projects have been approved for funding with an Irish spend of €78.1 million.  Two of the bigger projects are "Astérix and Obélix — God Save Britannia", starring Gérard Dépardieu, and a major television series, "Titanic: Blood and Steel".  Although at this stage it looks as if we will not reach the Irish spend of last year, nonetheless the number of projects remains high.  It should be pointed out that 2010 was a truly exceptional year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Section 481 relief has now been extended until the end of 2015.  This will assist in giving the sector continuity and certainty for the future and allows projects to proceed in the knowledge that this important underpinning of the industry will be in place for the next four years.  In an increasingly competitive international environment, I am glad to state that the board has been able to continue to discharge its vital role of promoting our indigenous film industry and marketing Ireland as a location for international productions.  Our cultural and artistic identity as a nation gives us a competitive advantage which must be exploited now more than ever.  The benefits of high levels of film and television production in Ireland will include increased international investment in the economy, increased employment in this sector, positive spin-off effects for promoting Ireland as a tourist location and the improvement of Ireland as an industrial location for all aspects of creative endeavours.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_1017">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Irish Film Board Act 1980, raising the ceiling on the total cumulative amount the IFB can provide to support the production and development of Irish films during the lifetime of the organisation.  If this legislation is passed the ceiling will increase from €200 million to €300 million.  The current level was set by the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2006 and the board has almost reached that limit.  Given the importance of the Irish film industry and its future potential, we will support this increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The Irish Film Board was established in 1980.  Its objectives are to promote the creative and commercial elements of Irish film-making and film culture to a home and international audience.  The board supports film projects through the provision of development funding and it also provides production finance by way of debt equity investment.  It encourages the development and training of technical, artistic and production personnel as a means of improving the overall skills proficiency within the industry.  It also assists the production and marketing of Irish films within Ireland and abroad, as a means of stimulating an interest in Ireland, Irish culture and Irish film.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Irish Film Board on the great work it has done and is continuing to do.  The previous Government understood the benefits of the film industry and supported the industry through section 481 tax reliefs.  Those reliefs have helped the Irish Film Board to attract major productions to Ireland.  The industry has gained invaluable experience as a result.  The industry has consistently demonstrated high quality standards of work.  It has earned several prestigious international awards and has developed valuable international connections.  The favourable tax environment and the invaluable experience held by Irish film crews are helping to secure a stream of new projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Early next year, Danny DeVito will direct his next feature film in Ireland.  This was confirmed by the Irish Film Board on 16 September last.  The film, which will star Morgan Freeman and Pierce Brosnan, was originally due to start shooting in September 2008 in the US.  After meeting the Irish Film Board last May, those making the film have decided to shoot the entire film in Ireland next year.  This will give us another opportunity to show ourselves on an international basis.  I give full credit to the staff of the Irish Film Board for ensuring that this will happen.  The extension of the tax reliefs and enhancements for films until 2015 has helped to consolidate Ireland's international position.  This was a most welcome measure in last year's budget in the context of the broad clampdown on tax reliefs.  There is huge potential in this relatively young sector.  Those involved in it are extremely well educated.  Some 90% of them are freelancers under the age of 50, with 59% of them having achieved master's or postgraduate degrees.  This compares with just 43% of those involved in the sector in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Last year, funding of €18.431 million was allocated to the Irish Film Board for 2011.  This was in addition to the section 481 film tax relief.  We are calling on the Government to maintain this important tax relief, along with the funding that is given to the Irish Film Board.  The benefits of film and television production in Ireland are not restricted to job creation in the industry.  One of the positive spin-off effects of this activity is that it promotes Ireland as a tourist destination, industrial location and centre of all aspects of creative endeavours.  The Minister will be aware that I have suggested that this country should explore the Canadian model in a bid to create further employment in the gaming sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The Creative Capital recommendations, which were published recently, are based on the 2008 review of the audiovisual content production industry.  The Irish Film Board commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct the review.  The main recommendation in the report is that the remit and mandate of the Irish Film Board should be extended to allow it to act as a specialist development agency for the audiovisual industry.  The report also recommended that the board should have responsibility for training and talent development.  The Irish Film Board and Enterprise Ireland should co-ordinate a development plan for the audiovisual content industry.  The plan should be based on the specific experience and expertise of each organisation.  The Irish Film Board and IDA Ireland should develop a strategic plan to attract foreign direct investment in the audiovisual content industry.  This should not be done at the expense of local companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">We need to increase the role of the Irish Film Board with regard to the creative and technical skills that are required by the industry.  We need to work with the education sector to develop these skills.  Currently, the Irish Film Board works with FÁS through Screen Training Ireland.  The Irish Film Board should develop strategic partnerships with local broadcasters.  The report has made a number of recommendations about the future of the Irish film industry, some of which are positive and warrant further consideration.  I hope the Minister will arrange to have this report discussed in the House in the near future, before any decisions are taken.  I would like to take this opportunity to convey to the Minister my disappointment about the 2012-16 capital investment framework.  It seems there will be a cut of approximately 20% in capital funding for the arts over the course of the framework.</p>

As this is essential to facilitate the continued operation of the board, I am happy to support it.  This debate gives us an opportunity to consider the important role of the board and the audiovisual sector in the social, economic and cultural landscape of Ireland.  I commend the Government's systematic approach to assessing the audiovisual industry, which led to the launch of the comprehensive Creative Capital report earlier this year.  We are all likely to agree that the audiovisual sector has enormous potential to create meaningful employment, offer successful careers, provide an outlet for fantastic creativity and self-expression and inspire a real sense of pride among the Irish people as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">The Creative Capital report provides a decent analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the industry and a possible blueprint for how the industry might grow and develop over the next five years.  I understand that an interdepartmental group is in place to expedite the recommendations of the report.  I hope we see some progress on the matter in the near future.  It is important that we take a thorough approach to how we manage this sector, measure its relative success and failure, ensure accountability, review and improve.  This point applies not only to those groups, organisations and companies that receive funding, but also to the sector as a whole, the State agencies and the Irish Film Board itself.  While it will not necessarily always be the main driver, we should not be afraid to measure the return on its investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Although there has been large-scale State investment in and subsidisation of this industry, directly and indirectly, over a number of decades, many weaknesses and areas for improvement were identified in the Creative Capital document and other reports, including those drawn up by various consultants and Oireachtas committees.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report highlighted deficiencies in the section 481 tax relief scheme and found it is open to occasional "abuse".  It is important that the deficiencies of transparency and competitiveness in this regard are remedied.  There is a great deal of goodwill towards this sector.  I imagine most people want the industry to go from strength to strength.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure the systems, supports and incentives in this area are not exploited by a small number of well-protected interested parties.  Some sort of exclusive elite or golden circle should not be created in the industry.  Transparency and accountability are needed at every level.  This applies to the recruitment and appointments process as much as it does to the funding process.  We need to ensure funding is allocated on the basis of merit within a mature and progressive industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Future development in the industry should be comparable to the best practice procedures that are applied in other industries.  We need to see the audiovisual industry as an industry like many others.  We support the ambitious target of doubling the value of the audiovisual market to over €1 billion in the next five years.  We want to see it achieved.  We want to see a near doubling of direct employment to over 10,000 full-time equivalents and an increase in exports. We want to see an energised and vitalised industry that is at the cornerstone of the Irish creative economy and can compete with the very best internationally.  A significant amount of change is needed in the industry to ensure all of this happens.  One of the most significant challenges for the sector in the long term is to become part of a new economic landscape where the industry is seen as an attractive option for career progression.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Talent is the central driver of all aspects of this industry.  It constitutes the quantum of creative, entrepreneurial and technical people working in the industry.  The nurturing of that talent, allied to education and training, are at the core of a successful industry strategy.  As part of this, we need to appreciate the rights and responsibilities of employers and the demands on them but we must also ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of all crew are fair and equitable.  We need to ensure that appropriate education and training courses are available, including at first, second and third levels.  We need to ensure that career and personal development programmes are in place and that work placement and on-the-job training are available and do not amount to some sort of exploitative scheme.  Proper certification and structure will be an essential part of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">This industry has the potential to be a really good story for Ireland.  We want to continue to see films such as "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan" being made here as well as international television productions such as "The Tudors" and "Game of Thrones".   We also want to see indigenous Irish productions like "My Left Foot" and "The Wind that Shakes the Barley".</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Last year we saw the fantastic potential of Irish animation with the "Secret of Kells" and "Granny O'Grimm" receiving international acclaim at the Academy Awards.  What was particularly special at that time was the coverage of Ballyfermot College of Further Education where some of the animators had honed their skills.  This was a great day for those nominated but also for the industry here and for Ireland as a whole.  I am certain it provided inspiration for thousands of students at home.  It presented a picture of endless possibilities — the possibility of a viable and sustainable career in this industry and, even more, the possibility of a successful and prosperous one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">To see that potential realised on a more frequent basis, it is essential that there is a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach.  It is a much-maligned fact that there are often in-built inefficiencies associated with cross-Department responsibility relating to specific segments of the industry.  Miscommunications and delays are far more frequent than desirable.  The interdepartmental approach which has been employed by the Government to date is to be commended.  It is important that we continue to review and improve this process and measure outcomes in an honest way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The idea of a co-ordinated approach is just as applicable on a North-South basis as it is on a departmental basis.  I read the recent reports into the industry but failed to notice any significant reference to the need for all-Ireland co-operation.  I hope this is because such co-operation is taken as an automatic part of our development.  It is essential that when we talk of growing the internal market, we talk about the island of Ireland rather than the Twenty-six Counties.  To do otherwise is to lower one's expectations by 20% before one even starts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">My colleague and Minister for Arts, Culture and Leisure in the North, Carál Ní Chuilín, is determined to see the development of a strong and vibrant audio visual sector.  Some of the successes in the North, such as "Game of Thrones", mirror the successes here.  A joined up approach is essential to create efficiencies and maximise potential.  I encourage the Minister to progress this matter at the next available opportunity, if not already done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The continued development of the broadband network, including nationwide high-speed coverage and digitisation of sites and screens, must be key priorities for the audiovisual industry.  These policies will be essential for stimulating local demand, increasing global access and ensuring that audiovisual content companies throughout Ireland function efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">Sinn Féin launched its alternative budget yesterday.  In it we proposed the investment of €2.5 billion of capital investment necessary for the roll-out of next generation broadband access throughout the State.  This would take Ireland to the top of the broadband league and increase our attractiveness for high tech jobs.  This is essential not only for those working in animation but right across the board in the audiovisual sector.  Failure to achieve this will undoubtedly have an effect on the potential success of job creation and sustainability here.  We believe that we could seek substantial investment for this roll-out from the European Investment Bank and should aim for an investment of €1.1 billion, or 44%.  The Government should give this serious consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The structure of this industry is fundamental to its future success.  There is a responsibility on the Government to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent, well invested and as far as possible, returns a dividend for the Irish people.  Ambitious targets have been set out in the past in this sector and in other sectors.  Now more than ever Ireland needs a success story, one that can create jobs, create hope and, in itself, lift the public mood.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_492">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2011.  It is an opportunity to discuss the very important issue of the film industry and the urgent need to have quality people on boards like the Irish Film Board, IFB.  It is also an opportunity to examine examples of best practice, the urgent need to link the issue with job creation and the huge potential in the area of film and communication and to acknowledge the great work being done and the revenue this produces for the State.  This industry provides in the region of 5,500 jobs but I will return to that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Last Saturday 18 Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Troy and I, were involved in recording for a project which supports Pieta House.  Thanks to Deputy Derek Keating, we all had a great day in Ballyfermot College of Further Education recording and filming.  I was totally blown away by the college, the staff, the students, the producers, the film crew and by all the great work being done there.  The college has approximately 1,500 students learning to go into the film business.  It is important to state we have this batch of new young students in Ballyfermot who are winning prizes and are out there in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">We have a lot of talented people and we need to nurture and develop that talent which, in turn, will lead to job creation, again another part of the strategy to get us out of this economic mess.  We must be brave, creative and radical.  Wanting something to happen is simply not an option.  I see the film industry as one of the strategies to get us out of this mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2006 in order to increase the maximum of the aggregate amount of any investments, loans, grants or moneys provided by the board towards the cost of making films and providing training in all aspects of the making of films from €200 million to €300 million.  The Bill does not propose any changes to the policy on the Irish film industry but an inter-departmental group is working on the future direction of the Irish film industry based on the recommendations in the Creative Capital report 2011.  It does not mean any additional cost to the Exchequer as the IFB budget is set by the Oireachtas each year.  Previously, when the primary legislation dealing with the IFB was being amended, the opportunity was taken to consider recent developments in the industry and the operations of the IFB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The Irish Film Board is a national development agency of the Irish film industry established by the Irish Film Board Act 1980.  The general functions of the board, as per section 4 of the 1980 Act, are to assist and encourage the making of films in Ireland and the development of an Irish film industry.  That section 4 is relevant in regard to job creation, about which I spoke.  We must assist and develop the Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">While the board is obliged to have regard for the expression of the national culture through film making, it is also empowered to participate in international collaborative projects.  Again, there should be a strong emphasis on our national culture, both from the point of view of culture and tourism.  One of the reasons tourists visit Ireland is for the experience — they are certainly not coming for the weather — part of which is our culture, music, language and scenery.  That should be linked into the whole debate on this legislation.  It is important we work on international projects and I commend those going on currently which are sharing materials and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Section 5 states that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make grants to the board to perform its functions out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It is important there is an artistic as well as a job creation dimension to these grants.  Getting more people employed in the mainstream film industry will make a massive contribution to the tax take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Sections 6 to 8, inclusive, permit the board to make investments, loans or grants for the making of films and the provision of relevant training.  Along with Deputy Troy and other Members, when we recorded a single for Pieta House at last Saturday's recording at the Ballyfermot studios, I saw how large is the number of top-class trained people in the audio-visual industry.  All moneys made from the sales of the single will be going directly to that mental health charity.  Will the Minister ask the Minister for Finance to reduce the VAT on the single if we make it to the Christmas No. 1 spot, which would increase the moneys going to Pieta House?</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Section 10 places a cap on the total level of funding which the board can provide, an important provision.  When appointing the board, I urge the Minister not to choose people he knows or who have been involved in a political party.  These traditional forms of political patronage can no longer be tolerated in modern Ireland as they only reflect the unethical standards of the past.  People with a proven track record in the film industry and who care passionately about it should be appointed.  Appointments cannot be made on the basis of another case of jobs for the boys or down to an individual giving €7,000 to the Minister in a donation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">This gives the Minister the opportunity to bring in new reforms through a transparent and accountable appointments system, a basic requirement in any democratic society.  We need the best people for the film board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The film board's main objectives are to promote the creative and commercial elements of Irish film-making and film culture to a home and international audience.  It supports film projects through the provision of development funding and also provides production finance by way of debt-equity investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The "Love-Hate" programme currently on RTE depicts excellently the horror of the drugs crisis and gangland killings that occur in our country.  This realistic programme is a wake-up call for everyone.  It should be watched by everyone over 18 years of age because it is the reality for many people across Dublin city.  Once again, the film industry has an impact on those who may not normally watch news and current affairs programmes by highlighting the horrors of gangland killings associated with cocaine and other drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The film board must also encourage the development and training of technical, artistic and production personnel as a means of improving the overall skills proficiency within the industry.  It has achieved this to an international standard over the past six years.  I commend all the staff involved in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Another of the board's objectives is to assist the production and marketing of Irish films in Ireland and abroad as a means of stimulating an interest in Ireland, Irish culture and Irish films.  As was seen at the recent global Irish summit in Dublin Castle, many people abroad have Irish connections and are willing to come up with economic recovery ideas.  While we may not have the sun, we do have culture and the landscape which provides a different type of holiday.  Many tourists who visit here will explain these are the reasons for their visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">I would like to see more enthusiasm from the Minister on pushing this agenda.  I want to see turnover in the audio-visual industry doubled to over €1 billion from its current €500 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">While the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2011 is technical in nature, it gives us an opportunity to discuss matters of importance to the industry.  My great interest in Irish film might spawn from the fact my father worked on "Ryan's Daughter" back in 1969 before I was even a thought in his mind.  The economic importance of the film industry is evident in how the location of this film in Dingle and west Kerry rejuvenated the local economy and put Dingle on the worldwide tourism map attracting thousands to the area.  Growing up in the late 1980s and early 1990s — a golden era for Irish film — is probably another factor contributing to my personal interest in film.  It is good to see the film industry achieve great success.  The Minister himself has a deep personal interest in film which I learned from my time spent working with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">I commend the Minister on the publication of his report, Creative Capital, earlier this year.  It sets out a plan to increase the number working in the industry by 5,000 and its annual turnover to €1 billion.  It is important that the Minister has a genuine interest in film.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">Orson Welles stated: "Create your own visual style ... let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others."  That quotation is very appropriate to the Irish film industry.  Everyone agrees that Irish people are unique.  We have our own unique outlook on the world, our own unique sense of humour and our own unique way of doing things.  That is something we must continue to include in Irish film because people internationally are interested in us and it is excellent to see that portrayed on the screen.  We have a rich literary and cultural heritage and a fantastic landscape to provide for outstanding cinematography.  We have all the raw materials here to build a thriving film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Reference was made to the opportunity to showcase Ireland through film.  I mentioned "Ryan's Daughter" earlier but I met an American couple during the summer who were holidaying here because they saw Ireland in a few clips in the film "Marley and Me".  Only about five minutes of that film were set in Ireland, yet they saw them and wanted to come here.  That highlights the power of film, and we should not underestimate that.  As I stated in a debate on tourism earlier in the term, film is an excellent medium for show-casing our country and we must be conscious of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The highly grossing films like "The Guard" or "Man about Dog" are important but some other Irish films have gone under the radar in recent years which were also important to the development of the arts here.  It is important that the Irish Film Board continues to support those projects as well as the labour intensive projects even though it is widely acknowledged that we must use every opportunity we have to create employment in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">In regard to activity in my own constituency and in Kerry, it is encouraging to see the success of local film festivals such as the Kerry Film Festival held recently and the Dingle Film Festival which has been running for the past few years and will be held again on St. Patrick's weekend.  These film festivals are an indication of the huge interest in film and it is important that they continue to get support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I am proud to be a patron of an upcoming feature, "The Island", which is a story of people who had left but returned to the Blasket Islands.  That is a project I hope will come to fruition in the coming years.  I am very proud to be part of it and I hope support will be given to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I commend the Minister's work on this legislation and encourage him to do what he can in the future to continue to build the industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</from>
          <p eId="para_1090">I welcome the Bill and the proposal that the ceiling on the amount to be invested in the production and development of Irish film would be increased by €100 million.  I welcome also the findings of the audiovisual strategic review steering group and its recommendation that we double the value of the industry to the country, double employment and increase exports.  When we talk about film, most people think of Hollywood or something that is mysterious.  Considering the opportunities identified in this report, we need a body like the Irish Film Board to interface on our behalf with international markets and with the global economy in terms of the global appetite for film to ensure we can stake our claim to a part of that market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">We all agree that we are creative and that our country is interesting.  We have a story to tell and as Irish people we love being creative in various ways.  We never say something directly; we always tell it with a story.  It is in our nature, so to speak.  For that reason we can grow the film industry here in an organic way because we have the raw material.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">I refer to my local area because this can be replicated around the country.  For years the small village of Tubbercurry, not far from where I live, have had a great tradition of theatre.  The year before last a great honour was brought to that town when one of their own people, Dearbhla Walsh, received an Emmy award for her involvement in film.  That brought great pride to all of us in our area because she had been nurtured in that film festival and the dedication that goes into that.  That is replicated throughout the country in amateur dramatics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">If we move on from that and consider the position around the country, we can see how well equipped the arts is now.  It is wonderful to see that.  In my town we have opened a state-of-the-art arts centre with a 250 seat theatre.  We have done that because there is a wealth of talent available and people need a platform and to be encouraged.  Already, youngsters can partake in film-making courses and classes at a fractional cost to what it would cost them privately.  That has been encouraged throughout the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">We hosted the Oska Bright Film Festival of short films and digital media where people with learning disabilities get to partake in the production of small films.  That involves companies in the United Kingdom also.  We hosted the festival some years ago in Ballina and it was very successful.  That allows us in turn to work with experts in the industry including actors and people expert in production, and also people with learning disabilities, to great celebration in our town.  That is replicated throughout the country and instead of looking at people who are at the high end of film production and the experts in that regard, the Irish film industry should look to see what is simmering at grass roots level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">One of the weaknesses in the arts overall is that it is not like football or other sports played by teams.  Artistic expression can be an individual pursuit.  People who work in the arts are dotted around the country and it is a challenge to get them to work together or get involved in the bigger picture or business or marketing or to make money out of their skill because there is not that co-operative effort.  I especially welcome arts centres and the emphasis on the arts in recent years.  The Irish film industry should and can link in with the efforts being made in arts centres throughout the country and the film festivals to bring to bear their expertise in encouraging the good work already going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Another area we should examine is bringing people up who already have some exposure to film, whether it is on the stagecraft side, the production side or the acting side, and that is in our education system.  We recognise through physical education and other courses that people need a broader experience in their education than a strictly academic one.  The whole area of theatre, production and film, and digital media should be a subject students can learn in their secondary school, and it should be recognised as such if we are serious when we say that this area potentially can create jobs.  If we have all this raw material and raw talent to work with we should formalise that and encourage students through courses brought into our education system that recognise that talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">Overall, it is forward thinking to invest in film.  The challenge is to tie it in with what is going on at grass roots level and to bring to bear that benefit to the industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1098">There can be no question about supporting this Bill.  I understand it is technical legislation, the purpose of which is to raise the ceiling for the amount the Irish Film Board is allowed to spend in its lifetime from €200 million to €300 million because it has almost reached that ceiling.  All of us should support this straightforward measure as it will allow the board to continue to function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">No one could disagree with the Minister's comments on the value and importance of the film industry and the need to promote and develop it.  While I am not one for blowing national trumpets because all countries have talent and ability, as many speakers noted, Ireland appears to have produced a disproportionate amount of literary talent which has fed into the creative sphere generally and film in particular.  One could say the same about theatre.  We have produced an impressive array of writers, directors and actors and should be proud of this tradition which we should nurture, develop, expand and invest in irrespective of the economic circumstances.  Producing films and art is an end in itself.  It does not require economic justification because film and art are good things in themselves.  They raise us above the drudgery of daily work, toil and so forth and make life and existence worthwhile.  This is what culture is about and there should be no question that we should invest, develop and expand film and art.  In so far as the Minister has indicated a desire to do this, he is right and I could not but agree with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In the current economic circumstances, it would be foolish not to recognise the economic advantage of developing this area in which we have resources, ability, talent and a reputation.  We can and should expand this sector because it has considerable potential to generate employment and, as a number of speakers noted, visitors to the country.  In this regard, I will make a passing comment which relates to my earlier point that film and the arts are an end in themselves.  We should be a little careful about turning film or art generally into a commodity or means of selling brand Ireland.  This is not what motivates our artists, writers and actors.  If this type of logic were to drift into the thinking or policy behind Government Departments' approach, it would do an injustice to film and art.  Art is not about selling or creating a brand or promoting an international reputation.  Handled sensitively and with respect and properly supported and nurtured, however, it will produce economic spin-offs in terms of employment, enhancing the country's reputation globally and attracting people to visit the country because they like what they see in representations of Ireland in film or when they see its artists, writers and actors represented in this arena.  All of these things are to be welcomed, as are all the statements that have been made in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">While it is one thing to propose raising the expenditure limit for the Irish Film Board on technical grounds, it is another thing for the money to be invested in the sector and that is where the problem lies.  We have a large coterie of artists, film-makers, technicians and designers who are at the highest level globally and can stand toe to toe with the best in the world in all the different aspects and areas of film, whether creative or technical or in areas such as production.  We also have great landscapes and so forth and the tax incentive schemes have delivered some investment in film and an expansion in film making which has generated jobs and revenue.  Notwithstanding these factors, we continue to under-invest in this area despite its considerable potential and talent.  A large number of the approximately 6,000 people who are directly employed in the film industry and the many others who participate in the making of films are working for a pittance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The budget for the Irish Film Board this year, which stands at €16 million, has been cut significantly, although the reduction has not been as bad as some of the other austerity measures imposed elsewhere.  Nonetheless, the allocation is significantly lower than it was in 2008, for example.  Regardless of whether the Irish Film Board's budget is €16 million or €20 million, we must put it in perspective if we are to understand how little we are investing in this area, which all of us agree is important.  This year's allocation is about half the budget of one major Hollywood movie.  If we all agree that the Irish film sector has potential and talent and jobs can be created in it, clearly an allocation of €16 million is paltry.  Thousands more jobs could be created in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Bill's digest notes that while Irish films win awards, they do not do well at the box office.  Part of the reason is that we do not invest in a distribution infrastructure and must rely on American distributors and other global players.  We are at the bottom of the queue because the money and resources being invested to develop the domestic industry are insufficient.  We are completely reliant on foreign cinema capital and the infrastructure of the US and other film industries.  As a result, we are not sufficiently developing or promoting our movies, talent and ability.  This vast untapped potential can only be realised if the State substantially increases its direct investment in film.  To do so would create a win-win scenario from a cultural, economic and employment perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">I ask the Minister to comment on an issue that has been raised with me by a number of people in recent days.  The individuals who contacted me pointed out that some of our tax incentive schemes amount to tax scams for certain wealthy elements in society as they are essentially a risk free investment on which wealthy people avoid tax.    It was also suggested to me that Anglo Irish Bank was up to its neck in lending to companies in this area but is not chasing them up for the moneys owed to the bank, and these same companies are not paying what they owe to technicians and the people who actually make the movies.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraMurphy" eId="spk_516">
          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1105">I also welcome this Bill, but I would dispute the assertion that it is a technical Bill, given the economic difficulty the country is in.  Under the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, it is welcome that the Government is making such a visible monetary commitment to this industry, which in the past has proven its vital importance to the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">It has been rightly said by many Members that the Irish film industry allows Irish people to celebrate their Irishness.  Unlike Deputy Griffin, who is involved in a movie in Kerry, I would not suggest for one second that I have such talents.  However, we have a rich history of being at the fore of whatever artistic medium is popular at any given time, whether that is our writers, playwrights, our musicians and those involved in audiovisual productions, including movies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">While I agree with other speakers that the end should be enough — the art in itself is of such vital importance — it is also welcome that the industry provides income to so many people.  I welcome the Minister's commitment and his target to allow the industry achieve €1 billion in value.  The industry currently employs 6,000 people and in a country as small as Ireland, that is a significant number.  I dispute the suggestion that people working in the industry are paid a pittance.  One of the great aspects of the industry is the degree to which projects are spread out across the island of Ireland, especially into rural areas, where the magnificent landscape and the traditional welcome Irish people give to visiting crews add to the value that international film makers can get by choosing Ireland as a location.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Reference to the potential monetary value does not diminish the art in itself.  That is a matter for the artists, the actors and the people involved in production.  Irish people have excelled internationally in the arts, including in film.  Allowing that to flourish, especially in the current climate, can have great potential for our economy in the broader sense.  We are in a competitive world and Irish people have punched above their weight, especially agencies like the IDA, in attracting companies to invest here.  Those involved in the production of films and documentaries are also bound by bottom line issues.  If we can encourage and assist them to come here, that is to be welcomed and I compliment the Minister on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">An industry has also been built up around film festivals.  Several Members spoke about film festivals that exist in different parts of the country.  The Cork Film Festival is perhaps the original film festival.  We also have the biggest Irish French film festival in Cork.  There has to be a potential in some of our twin cities around the world where Irish companies and communities could come together to showcase Irish film.  We have a different type of product and I know it is of major benefit to the French film industry when they showcase their work in our cities.  The Minister should encourage the Irish Film Board to look at a way where we could showcase some of the work that is done by our creative artists, which has great export potential.  I commend the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_517">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1110">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  While it is a short Bill, it is very important that we allow the Irish Film Board the extra funding that it will give it, with an increase from €200 million to €300 million.  That is a significant step and hopefully this money will be used properly to encourage growth in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">Given the number of films produced in Ireland over the last few years, it is easy to see that it is a thriving sector.  With continued investment, it will continue to thrive.  Other films that may not have primarily been set in Ireland but which contained scenes shot here, such as "Braveheart", "Saving Private Ryan" and "King Arthur" all have enjoyed worldwide success.  It will do our industry no harm that these international hits used Ireland as a location to film.  They would have shown our technical ability and the professionalism within the industry.  I welcome the increase in funding to the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">There is an artistic side to all this, but we need to figure out how to encourage the industry not only to boost film making, but also to encourage tourism.  It is important to look to the future to see how the industry can grow.  I understand that the audiovisual review steering group recommends that if continued investment was made, we could see some major gains made in the industry.  One of the recommendations states that we can double the value of the industry to over €1 billion.  This would lead to an obvious increase in employment, hopefully from the current figure of 6,000 to over 10,000.  The sector is valued at €550 million at the moment, representing 3% of gross domestic product and this means it is a key contributor to the Irish economy. Some 85 % of those working in the industry are in the independent sector, while 15% are in broadcasting, and this shows the huge potential for development in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">There are 567 companies in the sector at the moment, and the majority of these are based in Dublin and have been trading for five years or less, which shows that it is an industry in its infancy.  There is potential to spread this towards other major centres in the country, such as Galway, Cork or up in the North.  A better spread around the country would produce more employment in the years to come.  The vast majority of those working in the sector are under the age of 50, with nearly 60% of them educated to degree level.  One student from the college in Ballyfermot won an award for his role in "Avatar", which gained worldwide success and which is a fantastic recommendation for that college.  It is only one of many colleges that is beginning to recognise the potential in this, such as Blanchardstown IT.  I have a friend there currently doing a creative digital media course along with 50 other students.  That is a relatively new course and it shows the amount of young people who want to get into the sector and who believe in its potential.  Students at the Cluain Mhuire campus in GMIT are also involved in film.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The McCarthy report examined the role of the Irish Film Board and made some recommendations, including merging it with other organisations.  There is much in that report that I would not agree with, and considering the investment we are putting into the Irish Film Board, it is important to leave the board on its own, so it can continue to drive the industry and bring people to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">I welcome the Bill.  It shows that the industry is travelling in a positive direction at the moment.  I hope that it continues to go from strength to strength.  Not only can it continue to attract people to this country, it can also show us in a positive and businesslike manner.  I encourage the Minister to continue to do whatever he can to make this sector as strong as possible as it has the potential to employ an awful lot more people and gain a much stronger reputation throughout the world.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_1118">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Although it is a technical Bill, it will have far-reaching effects for the film and television industry in Ireland.  It will also have a good impact on our tourism industry, which I will discuss later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">It is important that we keep funding available for our local film industry so it can continue to produce the high-quality award-winning productions we are famous for the world over.  This Bill sends out a positive message to the industry, and the thousands of people employed in it, that we will support it as much as we can in these difficult times.  The Government has committed to targeted initiatives to boost job creation.  I see this Bill as one of those targeted initiatives.  The overall increase in the funding that can be granted by the film board will result in the creation of more jobs; indeed, the previous speaker spoke about a doubling of jobs over the next five years if the correct policies are followed, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The creative industry is an area in which we have expertise and in which growth can take place.  The number of college courses producing graduates in media production has been rising steadily over the years, which reflects the industry's importance in our society and its international reputation.  As a country, we cannot miss out on the opportunities with which our arts industry provides us to promote ourselves internationally.  Television shows and films that are produced here act as large-scale and lengthy tourism advertisements for Ireland.  Many films and TV shows have been filmed in my own county of Meath and have helped to promote the county and increase the number of tourists.  The Meath Film Commission attracts productions to the county while working with Meath Tourism; it is an example of the tight relationship that exists between the two industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Meath can be many things for many different films.  Scenes that require an element of Gaelic heritage can be shot, for instance, at Loughcrew or Brú na Bóinne.  Trim Castle was used, famously, for the filming of "Braveheart" back in the 1990s, with hundreds of local people employed as extras, which gave a great boost to the local economy.  The many beautiful vistas that dominate rural parts of the county can help produce beautiful, romantic backdrops for historical films, including those famously used in the 1975 Stanley Kubrick screen version of the 1944 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, <i>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</i>.  Our infrastructure gives great access to Dublin Airport so it is easy for international crews and tourists to get to the county.  The reputation of our country has taken knocks over the past number of years but the positive image that can be portrayed through film and television is one way of re-establishing our credibility on the international scene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Most recently, we had the production of "The Secret of Kells", which helped to improve our standing by playing upon the mythology of Celtic Ireland.  It took many images from the <i>Book of Kells </i>and brought them to life for a new generation.  Our Celtic mythology is one of the attractions of our island for many tourists and is a key selling point in the American market.  Clips from the film were seen by hundreds of millions of people when it was nominated in the best animated film category at the 2010 Oscars in Los Angeles.  That was a fantastic achievement for the creators of the film and the staff who worked on it.  Many American tourists in Ireland — indeed, over half — say they choose to come to Ireland for their holidays because of word of mouth.  Films such as these help to spread the message to Americans and are key to increasing our tourist numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">The messages are getting through: the latest figures from the CSO showed an increase of almost 400,000 people travelling here this year.  This produces opportunities for job creation and growth in the tourist industry and the arts industry.  I urge the Minister to work closely with his colleague in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to maximise the potential for growth in both industries.  We need to exploit all angles to stimulate job growth and I will be doing my best to help the Minister achieve this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelConaghan" eId="spk_521">
          <from>Deputy Michael Conaghan</from>
          <p eId="para_1124">I welcome this Bill, which proposes to raise the cap on the total cumulative amount that can be provided by the Irish Film Board to support the Irish film industry.  First, I congratulate the Irish Film Board on the success it has had to date in promoting the film industry and creating jobs.  With a relatively small budget, €16 million in 2011, the industry currently employs almost 7,000 people directly and is worth an estimated €557 million to our economy.  I also welcome the ambition of the industry and the film board.  A recent report, Creative Capital: Building Ireland's Audiovisual Creative Economy, envisages increasing employment to over 10,000 and doubling the value of the industry to over €1 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I would like to make four brief points on aspects of the Irish film industry and why it is important that this Bill is passed.  The targets set by the Creative Capital report are very welcome, but equally important is the need to foster the creative capacity of our young people.  In this regard, I wish to highlight the success of Ballyfermot College of Further Education in practically reinventing the film animation industry in Ireland.  From humble but committed beginnings 25 years ago, this school of film animation has blossomed and is now a centre for the training of world leaders in this genre of film-making.  Graduates of Ballyfermot College have formed successful companies such as Brown Bag Films, to name just one.  Graduates have also worked on some of the most prestigious animation projects in the world; for example, Richard Baneham, who won an Oscar for his visual effects work on the film "Avatar".  It is not always about big money.  Sometimes it is just a matter of creating the context and the framework in which young people can discover their creativity and find ways of expressing it.  I sat on the board of Ballyfermot College of Further Education for 19 years and I saw a lot of this evolve and develop on a shoestring.  It was the creativity and commitment of teachers and students that brought the college to the forefront.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">Over the coming years, another opportunity to focus the creative capacity of our young people will arise with the centenary celebrations of the Easter Rising, the 1913 lockout and the Great War.  These events are laden with potential for story-telling and image-making.  They are also ripe for a fresh interpretation by a new, younger generation.  I call on the Government and the Irish Film Board to work together to create a special centenary film bursary for which they can invite young film makers to apply.  This will give them the opportunity to tell the many untold stories of the period and commemorate and evoke these important events through fresh eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">In order for the film industry to reach the targets set out, it is essential that the skills of our young people match the ambitions of the film board.  Currently, 98% of freelance workers in the industry have a formal qualification and 41% continue professional training.  The Creative Capital report envisages an increased role for the Irish Film Board with regard to determining the creative and technical skills required by the industry and working with the education sector in the development of those skills.  Today's Bill will ensure that the film board is resourced to continue to invest in training and in the colleges that provide the necessary skills to support the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">It is important to support the industry in its entirety and identify gaps that may arise.  When people think of the film industry, they think of actors, camera operators, directors and producers, but there are a whole host of jobs created out of the limelight.  Downstream jobs such as lighting and sound and hidden craft and technical skills such as costume and set design are just as important for our young people, for the industry and for the country.  We need to ensure that colleges, particularly those that have already delivered in this area on a shoestring, such as Ballyfermot College of Further Education, Dún Laoghaire College of Further Education and Inchicore College of Further Education, are properly recognised and resourced to train professionals and develop the appropriate crafts and skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The success to date of the film and animation industries shows their potential and demonstrates the value of investing properly in education and training, encouraging young people, working with the colleges and thereby enhancing the capacity and potential of our industry.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianWalsh" eId="spk_522">
          <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1130">I wish to share my time with Deputy Áine Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As other Members have already outlined, it is a technical Bill which is modest in the scope of its provisions, but to my mind it is significant in its potential to bring creative and commercial benefits to Irish culture and the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The legislation does not propose changes to the existing policy, it merely raises the cumulative level of funding available to the Irish Film Board during the lifetime of the organisation.  It increases the figure from €200 million to €300 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Last week, we witnessed a fine example of the fruits that such an investment can bear.  An ambitious television series tracking the development of the <i>Titanic</i> in Belfast received a grant from the Irish Film Board and has already begun filming in Ireland.  The film is expected to cost in the region of €22 million and, of this, some €12 million will be spent in the Irish economy on goods and services.  This will help to support the 200 jobs created arising from the making of the film in Ireland.  Such projects have been brought to our shores as a result of the innovation and hard work of the members of the Irish Film Board.  The board regularly provides a considerable boost to our international profile,  stimulates people’s interest in visiting our country and provides a boost to the economy in general.  The television series is the latest in a plethora of commercial and creative successes that have punctuated the history of the Irish Film Board since it was formed in the early 1980s.  Since then it has performed commendably in identifying and nurturing the wealth of indigenous talents from within Ireland’s growing film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">One of the first beneficiaries of the Irish Film Board in 1982 was the Oscar-winning director Neil Jordan.  He has since emerged as one of the giants of international cinema.  Others have secured their big breaks under the auspices of the Irish Film Board before embarking on glittering careers in the industry overseas.  The industry represents an area of great potential for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">Earlier, I listened to the contribution of Deputy Finian McGrath and to my mind some of his comments were disingenuous.  He suggested that the Minister should up his game.  We are all aware that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has already brought together an interdepartmental committee which is considering the recommendations of the Creative Capital report.  This is an ambitious report and the Minister's aim is to double the value of the industry to Ireland and to bring it to €1 billion per year within five years and, as others have stated, to increase the numbers employed in the industry from more than 5,000 to more than 10,000 in a five year period.  Deputy McGrath should inform himself better before he makes such statements in the House.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has a deep, personal interest in the arts and an appreciation of the value of the film industry.  He has already acted swiftly to tap into the great potential in the Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">It is timely that the Bill should come before the House in the week following the inauguration of my fellow constituent and former colleague, the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, to whom the film board and the industry owe a great debt of gratitude for his work in this area over the years.  It was the President, Mr. Higgins, who reactivated the Irish Film Board in his role as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1993, some six years after it had been disbanded in 1987.  The abolition of the board was a blunt and retrograde act, ignorant of the contribution that the Irish Film Board had made to a labour-intensive industry that has served the country well.  The then Minister and now President, Mr. Higgins, upon entering office as Minister, committed to re-establishing the Irish Film Board as part of a highly ambitious programme of cultural promises that were seen by many as over-reaching at the time.  While discussing the Bill it is appropriate to acknowledge his marvellous contribution to the arts in general and specifically to the film industry during his time in the Dáil.  Expectations are similarity high now following his elevation to new office but I have no doubt he will be equally successful in fulfilling his great promise in his role as President.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">I support the Bill and I commend the Minister on his work to date in this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineCollins" eId="spk_523">
          <from>Deputy Áine Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1138">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to thank the Minister for introducing it to the House.  This is a necessary and important Bill to ensure the continued growth of the Irish film industry and to attract foreign productions to Ireland.  The Irish audiovisual industry is worth €557 million per annum to the Irish economy and has strong growth potential.  To achieve this, it is important to raise the ceiling on the cumulative amount the Irish Film Board can provide to support the production and development of Irish films.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">The Irish Film Board has had many tangible successes since 1993 when the President, Mr. Higgins, formerly the Minister for Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht, reconstituted the board.  I take this opportunity to congratulate our new President and to wish him all the best in his new position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The board has supported and invested strongly in the Irish film industry between 1993 and 2004 with some notable successes.  Board-backed Irish films such as "I Went Down", "The Magdalene Sisters", "Man about Dog" and "Intermission" received critical and commercial success.  In 2005, the award winning "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" was shot in Ballyvourney and Timoleague in my home county of Cork.  Such international exposure to the beautiful terrain of Cork clearly benefits the tourism industry.  Furthermore, these films were internationally acclaimed and received major awards at prominent film festivals.  In light of these successes, it is clear that the Irish film industry demonstrates export potential and that further investment will benefit the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">The board has been also instrumental in bringing some major international productions to Ireland.  During the past 20 years, Ireland has hosted several successful international productions such as "Braveheart", "Saving Private Ryan", "Reign of Fire", "Michael Collins" and the Harry Potter films.  The images of Ireland depicted in these films are a significant boost to the Irish tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">Similarly, the New Zealand tourism industry grew dramatically as a direct result of the filming of the Lord of the Rings trilogy among its beautiful landscapes.  Recently, the board was influential in securing a Bollywood film "Once There Was a Tiger" for Ireland.  This is the first time a major Bollywood production has been shot in Ireland and it will be a major boon to the economy.  The film used an abundance of Dublin locations such as Trinity College, the Guinness brewery, Henrietta Street, Dublin Castle, the quays and Temple Bar.  Tourism Ireland has stated that countries such as Switzerland, Great Britain and New Zealand have reported a significant increase in tourism from India following the filming of Bollywood movies in their regions.  Also, these major international productions employ many Irish workers and the skills base of these crews improve considerably.  The workers are then available to contribute to and to improve the quality of Irish films.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The board has also supported and invested in the emerging Irish animation industry.  Animation has grown in stature in 2011 with award wins and a strong presence at major events and festivals.  It is timely to discuss Irish animation today because this week the Encounters Bristol International Film Festival is showcasing new Irish animation talent in partnership with the Irish Film Board.  This year the festival highlights the work of Cartoon Saloon and its creative director and co-founder Tom Moore.  In 2010, this company received a nomination for best animated feature at the Academy Awards for "The Secret of Kells".  The festival hosted a special studio focus on the award-winning company, Brown Bag Films, and its co-founder Cathal Gaffney.  I agree with James Hickey, the chief executive of the Irish Film Board, who stated, "The Irish animation industry is a hotbed of talent and creativity, and this special focus at the Animated Encounters Festival will provide a real insight into the diversity of the work being produced in Ireland right now."  There is considerable untapped growth potential in this industry and the board's support of the animation industry should be encouraged.  The potential is limitless in this field given our highly skilled workforce.  Benefits would accrue to the Irish digital gaming industry as well since there is a high demand for people with a cross-over skills set.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">My support for the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill is a no-brainer.  Currently, the Irish audiovisual industry is worth €557 million per year and employs approximately 6,000 people.  There is vast potential in this sector.  The benefits of raising the ceiling of the board's funding are tangible and substantial.  First, simply put, the board's work has created jobs.  Irish films employ skilled Irish workers and the various large-scale international productions employ large Irish crews.  Second, international productions have improved the skills base of Irish workers and this will benefit the Irish film industry in the future.  Third, more tax revenue comes into the Exchequer from the production of films in Ireland.  Last, but not least, film is a great medium to advertise our wonderful country to the wider world.  Tourism will be a major growth sector if the board continues its fine work.  I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_1145">I am delighted to be able to speak on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, on the work he has done.  He has shown great interest in film-making.  Filmmaking has been a major part of our psyche and has created many jobs over the years.  Some speakers have said if one sees an area on film one might decide to visit it, which is good for tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The background of the Bill is to amend the Irish Film Board Act and to increase from €200 million to €300 million the maximum aggregate amount of any investment.  The role of the Irish Film Board has been to provide development and production finance for Irish film projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">Over the years we thought filmmaking did not involve rural Ireland or was not part of the Irish economy.  We have become experts at producing many great films.  I remember watching "The Virginian" growing up.  The father of James Drury was from Boyle.  When he rode into battle with the Indians we always said he was one of our own.  A year and a half ago he came back to Boyle and got out of his big limousine with his hat on.  He was surrounded by a lot of cowboys who happened to be from Boyle.  We were honoured to see one of our own coming home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Boyle is a small town of 2,500 people.  Chris O'Dowd, who has starred in "Bridesmaids" and "Gulliver's Travels" is also a native of Boyle and played minor football for Roscommon.  I understand he played against the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's team.  He is a normal young man who has made it very big in the film industry.  We think such people should be from Hollywood but they have not forgotten where they come from.  He always returns to Boyle and is very much part of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">I am delighted Deputy Collins reminded us of "The Secret of Kells" which received many award nominations.  Its producer was Paul Young who is also from Boyle, which is the new Hollywood of western Europe.  As a politician, people might say I am one of the best actors to come from the town but I am not paid as much as those people.  We are very proud of those who would not ordinarily be involved in the film industry.  As a result of the opportunities and finance made available by the Irish Film Board we have film stars in our midst.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Films such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Braveheart" were able to avail of the expertise of the FCA or the Reserve Defence Force.  It was wonderful.  We are competing against other countries.  When people want to shoot films in Ireland we can rely on all the vestiges of Government and the goodwill of communities.  Deputy Griffin is correct.  A film such as "Ryan's Daughter" gives an area a profile around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">I commend the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, on all the work he has done.  He has won five all-Ireland medals.  As a Minister, it is good to be able to tell people one is an expert in one's field, such as Gaelic football.  It is nice to see that when somebody comes to the country he or she will have the assistance, interest and enthusiasm the Minister has brought to his role.  I wish him every success now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">I would like to pay tribute to the Irish Film Board.  It has won recognition for many Irish films, such as "Bloody Sunday", "The General" and "I Went Down". Such films have articulated the lives of Irish people and the various troubles in Ireland.  Without the assistance of the Irish Film Board we would be under pressure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1153">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I want to pick up on a theme touched on by Deputy Feighan, namely the variety and quality of films released from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">A number of speakers have commented on the success of the "The Guard" which stars Brendan Gleeson.  We have produced many films of different tones in recent years which have done well.  It is a credit to the different people involved in the industry.  A film producer who comes to mind is Ken Wardrop.  He produced a film which featured women across the midlands speaking about marriage, family life and their experiences.  It was a beautifully produced film which got a lot of critical acclaim at home and abroad.  It came about through the creativity of Ken Wardrop and the support made available to him by many different organisations in Ireland.  I want to recognise the variety and success of people who are working within the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The Minister is aware of the first area on which I wish to focus, namely the future of the Light House Cinema in Smithfield.  It is an arthouse cinema which received a substantial amount of funding from the taxpayer recently but due to commercial difficulties it is currently closed.  A number of different companies have expressed an interest in taking over the running of the cinema.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">I ask the Minister, through his Department, to do all he can to make sure the cinema is reopened in recognition of the contribution made by the taxpayer and the huge value it brought to the northside of Dublin and beyond.  I urge that whatever company takes over the running of the cinema, which I hope to see happen, it continues to focus on the kind of films shown by its predecessor.  It was recognised and valued by many and its absence is keenly felt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">My second point concerns some of the recommendations of the Creative Capital report.  Cathal Gaffney, who is also involved with the Brown Bag Films, was involved in compiling the report.  The company has been extraordinarily successful in producing animated films at home and abroad.  I visited the company and saw the quality of work it is doing.  It is a world leader and is expanding and hiring graduates from Irish colleges as fast as we can produce them.  It is the kind of company the Creative Capital report and the organisations involved in the Bill are supporting and need to support in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">A particularly relevant point in the report was the need for multiannual budgeting for people who commission projects.  Companies need to have the ability to know what kind of support they might receive this year and into the future in order that they can plan their development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to do what he can about the Light House Cinema and the organisation beside it.  It is a complex performance space in Smithfield which continues to need our support to ensure it can continue to provide great art and performance space on the northside of Dublin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_526">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_1160">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Although other speakers have described the Bill as primarily a technical proposal, it nevertheless opens up an opportunity for discussion on this important area not only of economic activity but also of artistic endeavour.  The Minister's speech made clear his commitment to continue to foster this important sector for our communities and society in general, to say nothing of the business and economic aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">One cannot overstate the vital importance of the audiovisual sector to our country.  Several colleagues mentioned that it employs upward of 6,000 people.  That level of success is essentially a direct consequence of State support.  There is much debate at present on the role of the State and whether it should be involved in fostering commercial activity of one type or another.  Some are of the political view that the State should stay out of all of these areas, including the economy.  The film and audiovisual industry is a living example of the achievements that can arise from prudent investment through different instruments, whether tax relief, direct funding, attracting outside funding and so on.  Much has been achieved in the three decades since the Irish Film Board was set up in 1981.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">Several colleagues referred to the towering work of the President, Michael D. Higgins, as Minister with responsibility for this area in the 1990s.  It is no harm to acknowledge that others have also made an important contribution, perhaps in different circumstances and in a different context.  For example, the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, did much to advance our thinking in regard to arts and film.  It was under his Government that the film board was established.  There are not many opportunities for us to note the positive achievements of some of our predecessors in the Chamber, but that was an important one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">The 1990s saw a veritable flowering of activity in the creative industries, as they are sometimes broadly described.  For instance, there was the re-establishment of the film board following its disbandment.  More importantly, we saw other agencies, such as RTE, placing the arts at the centre of much of their activity.  That decade saw the introduction of the requirement that a certain amount of RTE's funding be set aside to finance independent productions.  That was a progressive move.  We had the expansion of the tax incentive scheme in 1993 and there was also an EU involvement in the form of the media programme.  On top of that we had the establishment of TG4.  These were all important elements in the flowering of creativity which took place in the 1990s.  The business and employment consequences of that were enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">We must take every opportunity we can to encourage Irish talent to make Irish films for an Irish audience.  That is what we have sought to do, with considerable success over the years, through the film board.  It is vital for the State to extend this type of support wherever we can and in whatever format we can.  However, we must also bear in mind that the audiovisual sector is not confined to film.  The media world is a noisy and crowded one, encompassing radio, television, mobile media, online content and so on.  Not only do we have a proliferation of new products, we also have a proliferation of new formats and new types of media.  Sometimes it is difficult to keep up with developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The audiovisual sector comprises, among other activities, writing, commercials, corporate video production and audio production.  In regard to the latter, there was a time when there was very little independent radio production, but activity in that area has increased substantially in recent years.  Digital content production companies have also expanded hugely in recent years.  We must be careful not to limit our horizons when considering the audiovisual sector and the types of supports we can potentially make available to it.  I have heard colleagues refer to the digital gaming sector, which is perhaps slightly beyond the remit of what is covered in this Bill.  However, it is an area of great expansion where people can translate their creative talent into successful businesses which create badly needed jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">I hope the recommendations in the Creative Capital report encompass and comprehend all of these new areas of activity.  Much has changed since the establishment of the film board, when the audiovisual sector would have been confined almost entirely to film.  I support the progressive recommendations of the Creative Capital report, in particular the recommendation that the board's mandate be extended to incorporate a role as specialist development agency for the industry.  A recommendation that is particularly dear to my heart is that the board have a responsibility for training and talent development.  That is hugely important in this sector.  The Minister observed in his speech that something like 70% of the costs of each production go on labour.  It is a very labour intensive industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">If we are to facilitate excellence in the sector, it is vital that we promote training and education in order to encourage young people who have a talent and interest in the area and who wish to improve their expertise and skills.  Colleagues referred to Ballyfermot College, which is offering incredibly progressive opportunities for young people to foster their talent.  We must work to promote and foster excellence and to provide the opportunity as best we can to encourage and develop talent.  Artistic talent is something which inheres in an individual in the first instance, where there is a talent to paint a picture, make a film or write an article or book.  The responsibility on Government and society is to do everything we can to foster that inherent ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">Needless to say, any effort to encourage artistic endeavour will cost money.  There was some criticism in this regard; it may have been from Deputy Finian McGrath — one must pay some attention to him every now and then.  To criticise the capital programme in regard to the Minister's Department is unfair.  If one considers the cuts that have had to be made across the board, the Department has done relatively well in the current context.  I am sure the Minister will fight as hard as he can for all of the heads of budget over which he presides.  That criticism was unfair when one considers the broader threats facing funding for all Government activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">The section 481 tax relief scheme is up for review in 2015.  I am in favour of its retention but, in common with all other tax expenditures, it must be carefully scrutinised.  While the Commission on Taxation supported the continuation of the relief, it pointed out that the Indecon report in 2007 was somewhat sceptical about the overall achievement of the tax reliefs.  I do not have time to go into that, but it is a cause for concern.  There was considerably less evidence for the success of the tax relief than I expected when I looked at the commission report.  On balance we are in a competitive world and need to promote the Irish audiovisual industry.  The report of the Commission on Taxation stated: "At the same time, however, we are aware of the competitive international environment which exists in the film industry.  Ireland competes with other countries and locations for productions.  These include Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, New York, Fiji and Hungary.  We also acknowledge the role which the sector plays in supporting a significant number of jobs in the economy.  We consider that film relief should be continued."  I am delighted with that conclusion, which is correct.  However, it will need to be scrutinised just as we need to scrutinise all the other reliefs.  I congratulate the Minister on this legislation and wish him well with it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_1170">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill which will raise the ceiling on the cumulative amount the Irish Film Board can provide to support the production and development of Irish films during the lifetime of the organisation.  I welcome the changes in the Bill and look forward to the benefits that these improvements can bring to the wider film and entertainment industry in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">In 2010 the industry as a whole bucked the employment trend and became a net employment contributor.  Furthermore the sector contributed more than €170 million to the Exchequer in 2010.  Increasing the level to €300 million will enable the Irish Film Board to assist and encourage film making and the development of a thriving Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">Today we have an opportunity to consider and discuss the work nationally and internationally of the Irish Film Board.  An important feature of the work of the Irish Film Board is to collaborate on and attract investment for international projects.  It is important for us to debate film making here in Ireland and to reflect on from where the Irish Film Board came and where we want it to go.  The Irish Film Board was established in 1981 under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Since then it moved to the Department of the Taoiseach and to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It spent some time in the wilderness between 1987 and 1993.  However, that year the Government introduced three pieces of legislation that laid the foundation for the creation of an Irish audiovisual content production industry.  The Broadcasting Act was amended to include a requirement for RTE to ring-fence funding for independent production companies, section 481 of the Finance Act was amended to provide a competitive tax incentive for film and television, and Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, was reconstituted.  Additionally, the availability of EU funds through the MEDIA programme and the establishment of TG4 in the 1990s have all been important steps in the ongoing development of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Recent growth has led to the strengthening of the Irish audiovisual sector in the Dublin, Wicklow and, more recently, Galway areas.  The technological developments that have facilitated the growth of the industry in the Gaeltacht — once considered a remote area — can now facilitate similar growth in other areas of Ireland that have shown an interest in and dedication to developing growth in the Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">According to its annual report for 2009, the Irish Film Board's objectives are to promote the creative and commercial elements of Irish film-making and film culture at home and abroad.  Film projects are supported through the provision of development funding and production finance via debt-equity investment.  An important objective is to encourage the development and training of technical, artistic and production personnel to improve overall skills proficiency in the industry.  It is also an objective to assist the production and marketing of Irish films to stimulate an interest in and awareness of Ireland, Irish culture and Irish films.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">Evidence of the benefit of the work of the Irish Film Board and the other incentives can be seen when we examine employment levels in the audiovisual industry.  The industry encompasses a range of activities including writing, commercials and corporate video production, audio studios and digital content production companies.  In 1991, some 694 full-time jobs were recorded.  These numbers have increased to 5,440 in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">According to the report, Creative Capital: Building Ireland's Audiovisual Creative Economy, published this year "Creative capital is the intrinsically human ability to create new ideas, new technologies, new business models, new cultural forms and whole new industries".  I believe that this little country of ours has creative capital which is the envy of bigger nations.  The report identified the strengths and weaknesses of the Irish film industry and made recommendations to Government.  It recommended specific policies that will equip the industry to successfully enter the next phase of its growth from a predominantly domestic platform into international markets.  It recommended a framework of policies and initiatives for Government that will stimulate growth over a five-year period which would double the value of the Irish audiovisual industry to more than €1 billion; increase direct employment in the industry from 5,440 to more than 10,000; and increase exports of Irish audiovisual production.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">It also recommended policies that are achievable, cost neutral, and that maximise the employment potential of the audiovisual content production industry.  To develop the industry and build strong companies it has recommended that section 481 to be extended from 2015 to 2020.  Concerns were expressed a few years ago about proposals to withdraw section 481 tax relief.  I am glad it was extended at that time and I hope it will continue.  It also recommended an annual international television co-production fund with high economic return; industry-wide industrial relations consultation with a view to concluding comprehensive agreements, which needs to be done as a matter of urgency; establishing a piracy prevention and policy group; and continuing broadband roll-out and investment in digital sites, which is critical for the regional areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">A strategic plan concentrating on audiovisual exports should be prepared by the relevant agencies, Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Film Board, Culture Ireland, and the Irish Film Institute, in consultation with the industry.  The great work the Irish Film Institute undertakes in the preservation of Irish film and the exposition of international film does not get sufficient recognition.  This plan should include metrics to measure cultural exports.  The global market is projected to grow at a rate of 30% over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">It is helpful to acknowledge some facts and figures about the industry.  In 2007, the industry had an annual economic value of more than €550 million and sustained more than 500 Irish-owned companies.  The Irish Film Board review of the industry has revealed that the audiovisual content sector is valued at €557.3 million.  Some 567 companies operate within the sector, comprising production companies, post-production companies and service producers.  Most are Dublin based with 85% involved in production including documentary-factual, short-film and film genres.  This is something I would like to see addressed.  I believe that support for regional film offices would not diminish the industry in Dublin but would enable production companies located regionally to become involved in bigger production.  If local interns were taken on when productions are being filmed in the regions then very soon a pool of skilled or semi-skilled people would be built up with the locality benefiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, I was proud to initiate the formation of the local film commission, FilmOffaly, almost five years ago.  An offshoot from this has been OFFIine, a film festival now in its second year.  Last month we screened films, delivered workshops on diverse topics relevant to film making and had a 72-hour short film challenge.  The benefit to the local economy could be evaluated among other things by the number of bed nights taken up by visiting film-makers and the use of services in the area.  I welcome the emergence of similar agencies, including Screen West which emerged last year and Cork Screen Commission which was launched during last week's successful Cork Film Festival.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">Who are these film makers?  In general they are under 50, with the majority being male.  Some 59% are educated to degree level at least and 41% continue in professional training.  That is not to say that women are not making films here.  Carmel Winters, Maya Derrington, Katie Holly and Nicky Gogan are all making their mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">There are recommendations which need to be examined on training and talent development.  Film Base which is funded by the Arts Council has been providing practical training to graduates over many years introducing a master's degree this year.  I have no doubt some mechanism for connecting it with the Irish Film Board could be found.  As this training organisation is already in existence, we should use it rather than setting up something else to compete with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">Relationships with other agencies including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland could be forged to work with the Irish Film Board to make a plan to attract foreign direct investment balancing the expertise and experience within each organisation.  Developing relationships with third level institutions, including Ballyfermot College of Further Education, IADT, DIT and others is important in order for them to deliver courses to provide the skills required in the developing audiovisual and transmedia industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">Success at the box office is a major challenge for Irish industry and does not reflect the high esteem in which Irish filmmaking is held internationally.  Successes and awards received include Academy and Emmy awards, Golden Globes, as well as representation at Cannes, Sundance, Toronto and Berlin film festivals.  Our Irish animation talent is now coming to international attention.  Since relocation of the Sullivan Bluth studio to America in the 1980s, Irish animation has not featured too frequently.  However, this has changed with Cartoon Saloon and Brown Bag Films taking international awards.  The Irish Film Board and film makers must be more targeted in marketing Irish films.  Overseas distributors and Hollywood films prevent Irish films accessing the screens and succeeding at the box office.  I am glad to note "The Guard" recently bucked this trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">A figure worth mention can be found in the Audiovisual Federation Review 2011 which found that in 2010 film and television productions had a combined budget of approximately €388 million, with €204 million of that spent in the Irish economy.  These are figures of which we need to take note.  They are not be sniffed at.  The benefits of attracting high levels of film and television production in Ireland include increased international investment in the economy, increased employment, positive spin-off effects for promoting Ireland as a tourist location and the improvement of Ireland as an industrial location for all aspects of creative endeavours.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will say when I am out of time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">While the changes recommended in the Bill before us today will hopefully lead to larger film and television productions and a stronger industry as a whole, it is essential that industry elements that lie outside the traditional hubs of Dublin, Wicklow and Galway benefit from the increase of activity in the sector.  While I am obviously keen to represent the constituents of Laois-Offaly as a priority, these sentiments were recently shared by a national industry report.  The Creative Capital report on building Ireland's audiovisual creative economy to which I referred earlier refers to the need for a regional policy to assist local film offices and digital industry initiatives develop in a co-ordinated manner and to ensure that regional and national policies for the industry are aligned.  It also recommends that small, niche content companies and content creators driven by innovation and creativity be protected and developed.  We have many such small companies throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">In an age where new technology can facilitate job creation, media creation and information sharing, it is essential that it and the subsequent industry investment can, where the skills and facilities exist, enable storytellers from all over Ireland to tell their stories in their own way and in their own place.</p>

I thank Deputies Finian McGrath, Griffin, Mulherin, Boyd Barrett, Murphy, Connaughton, Hannigan, Conaghan, Walsh, Collins, Feighan, Donohoe, White and Corcoran-Kennedy, all of whom made good contributions and were obviously well briefed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">I will now respond to some of the issues raised.  Deputy Troy raised the issue of the public capital framework and asked about the exact allocation for the Irish Film Board within the envelope available to me.  Obviously, that information will be announced when the Estimates are published in a few weeks time.  Deputy McLellan made a number of points.  I thank her for her recognition of the Creative Capital report and her acknowledgement of the implementation body which is currently trying to put in place the various recommendations made.  The report was important and was commissioned by the previous Government.  However, as important is implementation of the report.  The implementation group has met on three occasions.  I hope to have a report from the group prior to Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Deputy McLellan also referred to North-South co-operation.  I agree that this is an area wherein there can be huge co-operation.  This is to some extent happening already.  Two immediate examples in this regard are Cinemobile and Cinemagic.  Also, filming of  "Good Vibrations", which was co-funded by the Irish Film Board and Northern Ireland Screen has just been completed.  I agree with Deputy McLellan that access to broadband is important in the digital age and that we must invest heavily if we are to obtain quality transmission.  As I stated at the commencement of this debate we are well able to translate but do not transmit too well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">Deputy Finian McGrath asked about appointees to the current Irish Film Board.  I did not appoint the current board but I understand it is an effective and good board.  When I get the opportunity of appointing a new board in 2013 I will appoint the best people for the job, as I have done in respect of any appointments I have made.  I do not make appointments based on political affiliation, rather they are based on ability to do the job.  Deputy McGrath also called on me to "up my game".  I will be promoting the film industry in Silicon Valley next March.  No doubt Deputy McGrath will be the first to raise issues around the cost of the trip and so on.  The Deputy gave a good presentation of the 1980 Act, which is 30 years behind time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Like other speakers, Deputy Griffin referred to the connection between film and tourism.  There are a number of film festivals throughout the country.  There are three film festivals in Kerry, including the Kerry, Dingle and Waterville film festivals, all of which are important.  I visited Cork last Sunday week at which time I launched the Cork film festival.  There were approximately 800 people in the Cork Opera House and there was a great atmosphere there.  A large number of people travelled to the festival from Europe and America and many of the entrants came from Europe, America and beyond.  It was very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">I am aware that Deputy Griffin is involved in "The Island", a film located in the Blasket Islands.  It is very exciting.  The Deputy referred to the impact of "Ryan's Daughter" on Kerry.  It put west Kerry on the map.  Deputy Mulherin referred to Dearbhla Walsh whose Emmy Award for cinematography in "The Tudors" should be recognised by all of us.  It was a remarkable achievement.  Ms Walsh has helped to put Irish film and animation on the map.  I agree with Deputy Mulherin's remarks in regard to the connection between local areas and film making.  For example some of our most successful films in this country include "The Field", which was based on a local issue, "The Quiet Man", which was based on an individual from north Kerry, Paddy Bawn Enright, although his name was changed for the film and "My Left Foot" which is also local.  I acknowledge the importance of recognising local stories and of their conversion or translation into film.  I also acknowledge the connection between education, film production and digital media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Deputy Boyd Barrett stated that we appear to have produced a disproportionate amount of literary talent.  I believe we punch above our weight in terms of the number of creative people we have in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">Section 481 was referred to.  Tax foregone in 2010 was approximately €50 million.  However, the benefits we have received are huge in comparison to that amount.    Section 481 is similar to our corporation tax rate of 12.5% because the provisions in this section are what brings film production to Ireland.  One of the reasons the series "Titanic: Blood and Steel" is being shot here and not in Northern Ireland is probably due to section 481 and the availability of funding.  It is important this section is preserved.  The provision may have been abused in the past but the regulations have been tightened considerably.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to Anglo Irish Bank but I am not aware of any such abuse or circumstances of the kind to which he referred.  I suggest he write to the chairman of the bank if he wishes to have further information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">Deputy Connaughton mentioned the reference in the McCarthy report to the Irish Film Board.  Fortunately for the Irish Film Board, it is no longer on a list so it will survive.  A list will be published tomorrow and it is only right that the film board is not on that list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">Deputy Halligan referred to our international tourism reputation which was also mentioned by a number of speakers and how his county of Meath has benefited.  Deputy Conaghan raised a number of important issues.  He referred to Brown Bag Productions and to Jam.  I note his reference to the 1916 centenary celebrations.  I am the chairman of the Oireachtas centenary group and, as he suggested, I will seek out its ideas on how the 1916 Commemoration and the anniversary of the War of Independence can be celebrated by means of film and documentaries.  The <i>Titanic </i>anniversary falls within this period and the series is a good start.  I refer to the success of “The Wind that Shakes the Barley” at Cannes in 2006.  Its success shows that we have some very interesting subjects for film and that we as a country are now mature enough to be able to look at both sides of the argument as regards the Civil War.  I can think of many individuals who would be very suitable subjects for documentaries or films.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">Deputy Walsh made reference to the film "Braveheart" and to President Michael D. Higgins.  This gives me the opportunity to recognise his contribution in this area.  The production of the film "Braveheart" would not have happened in Ireland without Michael D. Higgins.  As the then Minister, he organised for the Defence Forces to be involved in the filming.  He provided every encouragement to the production company in order to have that film produced in Ireland.  As a result, the United Kingdom changed its system of incentives for film-making because the incentives in Ireland were regarded as working very well.  His general support of the film industry was critical in the formative period of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">Deputy Áine Collins made a number of very good points.  She mentioned how the film, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" was made in her area and she recalled its importance for the area which included a boost for the tourism industry.  She referred to the Bristol festival which is a showcase for the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">Deputy Feighan highlighted the significant connection between Boyle and film-making.  There are very few towns in the country that could boast of connections with Chris O'Dowd, James Drury or Paul Young.  I expect a proposal from Deputy Feighan for a Boyle film festival very shortly——</p>

          <p eId="para_1204">Of course, she is another one.  There is an excellent basis in Boyle for a very good film festival and it already has one of the better arts festivals in the country.  I performed the opening ceremony this year and I was very impressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">Deputy Donohoe mentioned the Light House Cinema.  Some progress has been made in efforts to re-open it and it is hoped there will be developments.  He also referred to the animation sector and Cathal Gaffney who is the managing director of Brown Bag Productions, a very successful company.  He was also involved in the creation and production of the Creative Capital report, to which he devoted months of his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">State support is vital to the film industry as the indigenous industry would not be able to survive without it.  Section 481 and investment by the Irish Film Board are critical to the development of the Irish film industry.  The return is very obvious and every euro expended brings a return of €10.  The benefits to the country from the film industry and film production have not been fully measured and many are intangible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">I refer to the important contribution to the training and education of film-makers made by colleges such as Ballyfermot.  When I was in opposition we all worked together with regard to section 481 to have it extended to 2015.  Agreement was reached between all the spokespersons and the Minister to extend the section to 2015.  This is one area in which politics benefited everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred to the Irish Film Institute which has done excellent work.  A very important film archive is not stored in the best conditions and new storage is required.  As a result of collaboration between NUI Maynooth and the Irish Film Institute, it is hoped that proper storage will be provided in the right environment to ensure this valuable archive of film shot in this country will be preserved for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Last week I launched a DVD of all the all-Ireland finals from 1947 to 1959.  These were filmed by an American company.  In 1947, when Kerry played Cavan in New York, the president of the GAA had the vision to ask an American film company to film the final in New York and this company filmed the all-Ireland finals up to when the national television service was established.  This is a very interesting and important recording from the point of view of social history.  It shows people going to the matches, how they dressed and the films show how the game has evolved in terms of athleticism.  I was pleased to be in a position to give €120,000 towards the cost of this purpose-built archive in Maynooth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">I thank the Acting Chairman and all those who contributed and listened to the debate.  I welcome all the contributions and thank the Deputies for remaining in the House.  This is an area where there is general agreement.  We should all be very proud of our film industry and be supportive of the initiatives being taken at present, in particular by the Irish Film Board.</p>

        <heading>Report by the Interdepartmental Group on Mortgage Arrears: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_535">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1212">The Keane report favours bankers over the ordinary person.  This is hardly surprising considering the make-up of the group which put together the report — 17 officials from Departments, three Central Bank representatives, one AlB representative and one EBS representative.  The fact that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, was not consulted in any way says it all.  The report refuses to accept that debt forgiveness must form the major part of the solution even though current mortgage costs are driving people over the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">How can the Minister for Finance be so cruel?  Unfortunately, his past treatment of people who suffered from hepatitis C shows he has an obsession with protecting the State even if that means bulldozing the very citizens who make up that State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">There is an underlying problem in that there is a notion that people should not be allowed to avail of debt forgiveness because they do not deserve it.  The thinking is that the people who are now in trouble are where they are because they were reckless or stupid in some way.  Obviously, no group of people is entirely homogenous and some home buyers were indeed reckless.  However, those people are a real minority.  The rest, the vast majority, only bought a house to give shelter and comfort to themselves and their families.  Some are of the opinion that these people must have been stupid not to know that house prices were unsustainable and would collapse.  Who would have told them that?  Was it, perhaps, <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i>?  No, they were too busy baling money from their property pages to be able to see what was coming.  The same can be said for local newspapers, many of which are now out of business because they were sold on to large media magnates which believed the revenue from their property pages was never going toend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">What about our politicians?  The king himself, Bertie Ahern, certainly did not give any warnings to people.  He did the opposite when he declared that anybody who said it would end in tears should commit suicide.  The Opposition, now in government, certainly did not give any warnings.  Its Deputies were so sure the boom would continue they insisted the Government should increase spending, a massive chunk of which would have had to come from building industry revenue.  The truth is the State is at fault for leaving people with mortgages that are between two and a half and three and a half times above a sustainable level — at any time.  The State caused this problem and therefore must rectify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">Solving this problem should not mean destroying people's self-esteem.  However, that is what the Keane report would bring about if it were put into practice.  It would make people work all their lives in order to pay the equivalent of a mortgage without, in the end, owning the house.  That is the best case scenario in some cases.  If the housing market does not rise by an average of 2% during the next 30 years and if mortgage holders do not get pay rises not only will they have nothing after 30 years of payments but they will end up owing a small fortune.  How can this be fair?  Why are these people being punished for the crime of doing what they were encouraged to by the media and the powers that be?  It should also be remembered that half the money that was taken out towards a mortgage came back to the State through various taxes and charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The principal reason for the high cost of mortgages was the actions — more properly, the inaction — of the State, the greatest of which was the failure to regulate the banks.  Furthermore houses prices were driven yet higher by cartels dealing in building materials, helped by Government.  The current Government has proved no better in dealing with such cartels.  To date Irish-based companies sell concrete to Britain for 40% to 50% less than the price they charge in the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">We are told that the country cannot afford to provide debt forgiveness.  The reality is we cannot afford not to provide debt forgiveness.  Everybody knows the State has access to €9.7 billion for dealing with mortgage debt yet it refuses to use it.  The Keane report states that writing off negative equity for all Irish mortgage debt will cost in the region of €14 billion.  In a newspaper article Mr. Constantin Gurdgiev showed that this figure of €14 billion is not relevant in dealing with what matters most, namely, the problems of ordinary first-time buyers.  He stated that if debt forgiveness were targeted at this group the cost would be closer to €6 billion to €8 billion.  He also tackled the issue of so-called "reckless" people, suggesting that debt write-down should be done on the basis of average house prices in any given region.  This would mean a person who built a mansion would not get as big a write-off, which might be called punishment.  In such cases people might be left with some negative equity but the affordability of the mortgage would be greatly increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">If the Government were to use between €6 billion and €8 billion to write off debt that would not be the ultimate cost to the State.  People whose mortgages were seriously reduced would have money in their pockets to spend which would go back to the Government through taxes.  As a result of this spending, employment would be stimulated and the State's social welfare bill would be reduced.  People who were no longer in negative equity could sell their houses if they wished to move, for example, to take up a job opportunity.  As things stand, mortgage holders are forced to stay where they are because they cannot sell their house.  The recommendations in the Keane report would reinforce this problem rather than alleviate it.  If the report is followed through it will make permanent a lack of mobility in the work force.  This will cost the State money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">Lower mortgage payments would also result in people not needing or demanding as much for their labour.  Jobs which are currently unattractive for reasons of remuneration would become far more feasible for people.  People do not want a great deal of cash because one can get nothing with it.  With debt relief people would be able to work for what counts as a normal wage in the rest of the developed world and that would increase our competitiveness.  As things stand there are very few wage packets that reach the level required to pay off even an average mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">One area relating to mortgage debt that is not taken into account, although we discussed it in the Private Members' motion, is the economic effect such debt has on people's mental and physical health.  The current situation puts a massive strain on people.  If this is allowed to fester they will be more likely to need our already stretched health services, thus costing the State more money, both directly and indirectly, through days missed at work.  The Keane report states it is not possible to tell with any reasonable accuracy whether the 88% of mortgage holders who are paying their original mortgage can afford further hits.  Obviously, it is not possible to find this out if one talks only to civil servants from the Department of Finance or the bankers who got us into trouble in the first place, in other words, the people who compiled this report.  If they had engaged with an organisation such as MABS, or had looked at data from the Irish League of Credit Unions which has compiled a "what-is-left" disposable income tracker index, they would have concluded that people cannot absorb any further hits.  In the latest ILCU study, 25% of those surveyed have a meagre €70 left after essential bills are paid.  The introduction of the household tax next year will immediately bring that figure down to just over €60.  The inevitability of increases in taxes in the budget will push people even closer to the edge.  If further increases in energy bills over the coming year are thrown into the mix it becomes inevitable that the figure of 88%, namely, those still paying their original mortgage, will decrease significantly. Some experts say that by the end of next year, the figure could be as high as 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">Unfortunately, it appears that regardless of what is said in this House, the Minister is not for moving.  It seems that those who showed ambition by providing homes for their families are to be pummelled and kicked about.  At the same time, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are watching on as Greece is about to secure a 50% reduction in some of its debts.  Regardless of what the final figure is, it will dwarf the amount of money that would be required to reset Irish mortgages to a sustainable level, out of the mire of negative equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">In the past, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has urged people to talk to their banks and to come to an agreement.  I have to say this is a good idea.  The Minister should be taken up on it.  The concept of safety of numbers should be applied when doing so.  In other words, a massive group of mortgage holders should come together to renegotiate their debts.  It is obvious that the banks are more likely to listen to 100,000 people who are looking for debt forgiveness than to the pleas of a solitary mortgage holder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">I think this can be done by means of a mortgage strike, which would be an act of solidarity.  It would require the mortgage holders of Ireland to come together and assert themselves collectively.  As I have said, there is strength in numbers.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions passed a motion at its congress calling for a mortgage strike.  The motion asked mortgage holders to sign up to a specific website.  The manner in which the mortgage strike has been designed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions means that the strike will be triggered when 100,000 people have signed up to it.  It is being done in that way to ensure individuals are not exposed to the immense clout that the banks enjoy in the courts and with our Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">By acting collectively, the individual mortgage holder will become a new force in the whole bank versus citizen debate.  The mortgage strike has two objectives — to repudiate the debt which rightly belongs with European banks and to reset all primary residential mortgages to a level that will release households from negative equity.  The mortgage strike will give the Irish people a chance to do something about their situations.  It is quite clear that politics has failed us.  It is up to people to grab this chance.  It is the only remaining option for the citizens of this country to put right the immoral and unsustainable debt that has been imposed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The proposed mortgage strike would continue indefinitely until the European Central Bank agrees to allow all primary residential mortgages to be written down to a sustainable level and to take an equivalent amount of debt off the Irish national debt and onto its own books.  The euro was a flawed design from the start.  Irish citizens should not have to pay the price for this flaw.  I am calling on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to move ahead with the mortgage strike that their members ratified.  If they believed in it strongly enough to ratify it, they should follow through on it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_536">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1227">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I am pleased that this debate is ongoing in the House.  I thank the Chief Whip for facilitating it.  This is a matter of great concern to everyone.  I commend the level of participation in the debate and the ideas that are being proposed.  The issues of mortgage and personal debt are having a damaging impact on our society.  The Keane report should be viewed as a vital first step on the road to addressing mortgage and personal debt issues in this country.  All the signs indicate that the number of people sliding into difficulties is increasing steadily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">The Central Bank has published figures indicating that 56,000 households were in mortgage arrears in June 2011.  According to the Department of Social Protection, some 19,000 people are receiving mortgage interest supplement welfare.  When one considers that many households have come to temporary <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with their lenders, it is clear that almost 100,000 Irish households are experiencing difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">This crisis has been allowed to develop.  The banks were lending too freely, with no regulation or oversight and little thought for the day when the Celtic tiger era would end.  This crisis will continue to develop if action is not taken.  I welcome the fact that the Government is taking on this issue.  The Keane report offers a good starting point.  Published figures show that between 1995 and 2006, the ratio of Irish household debt to disposable income went from 48% to 176%, which was an increase of 267%.  This does not bode well when compared to the increases of 63% in the UK, of 9% in France and of 26% in Canada during the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">It is a pity that Deputy Ming Flanagan has left the House.  He suggested that we did not raise this issue when we were in opposition during the last Dáil.  We certainly did.  Ministers in the last Government, which drove the crisis, have to put their hands up in this regard.  When Fine Gael was in opposition, it raised these issues with the former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance at every opportunity.  Deputy Bruton, in particular, did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">House prices and exposure to mortgage debt are the main contributors to this problem.  We must not forget term loans, credit cards and other exposures.  These issues will also have to be dealt with.  Many people feel that debt forgiveness is the answer.  The moral hazard argument that would have been associated with debt forgiveness no longer holds any water in light of the State's bailout of the banking system.  However, I do not think the solution is as simple as debt forgiveness.  Nobody likes to hear that every mortgage that is in difficulty has its own set of individual circumstances and that, as a result, any blanket change has the potential to destabilise the economy even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">Many people have said that the Keane report is flawed and have chosen to ridicule it.  The Government has made a good start by inviting groups to make submissions, to examine the Keane report and to come up with recommendations.  We need to have an honest debate.  I do not ridicule the Keane report because I think it is a good starting point.  There are no definitive answers in it, but it certainly starts a debate.  It proposes a number of solutions that can be built on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">Some of the tools that are proposed in the Keane report, such as trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and the mortgage-to-rent scheme, emphasise the Government's commitment to ensuring that no family has to leave its home.  That is also the primary objective of the Keane report.  A methodology or framework for the use of the tools I have mentioned is also outlined in the report.  It sets out a defined role for local authorities and housing associations.  I expect that the role of housing associations in this country will increase.  They play a significant role in Scotland as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The banks are capitalised to the extent that mortgage debt is covered.  This cost is already in place.  We are paying for it.  However, there is a tardiness in the banks' approach to dealing with the issue.  It is time for them to act properly.  They have the tools and the necessary capital.  The record of the banks in engaging with distressed mortgage holders is poor.  Despite all the spin, jargon and rhetoric, the banks are simply not engaging with their customers.  If we are to face up to this issue, the banks will have to sit down with their clients and come to arrangements.  They have a clear obligation to engage.  Such an approach must be taken across the board by our financial institutions if a solution to this growing problem is to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">I am glad the Keane report makes it clear that the introduction of modern bankruptcy legislation is an absolute priority.  This aspect of the problem does not secure the flashing headlines associated with mortgages and negative equity.  However, it is critical.  The report of the Law Reform Commission advances us in this area.  The fact that we are a modern consumer society with a dependency on credit means it is critical that we now establish a principles based system allowing for debt resolution in a way that limits overall costs to society.  In essence, this means a modernisation of our bankruptcy laws.  The moral hazard issue remains valid despite the fact that the banks have been so favourably treated.  We cannot allow debt in itself to become all consuming, as it has the potential to do, because of our particular Irish set of personal debt circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">We need to create the correct balances between the rights of creditors in terms of their expectations that debt will be repaid and the obligations of debtors in terms of their ability to pay.  Having said this, modern insolvency legislation, which must include mortgage debt, is a useful tool that the citizen can use to stop the stonewalling of the banks that is now occurring as they deal with individuals in difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">I am glad the Minister has initiated this debate and honestly acknowledged that there is no magic solution.  Until we sort this out, there will be stagnation in our domestic economy and no amount of export recovery will take up the slack.  We need to break the impasse created whereby society can distinguish between those who can and those who cannot repay their debts.  The historical soft treatment of the banks has clouded the issue and for genuine progress to be made we need clear blue water between our banking system, which should facilitate not drive the economy, and the Government and the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">The problems associated with mortgage debt and personal debt needs clear action.  There is no silver bullet or one size fits all solution but we must seek and introduce a range of measures that aid those in difficulties and who face unsustainable mortgages.  The Keane report is a decent starting point from which solutions can be developed.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_537">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_1239">I wish to share time with Deputy Heather Humphreys.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">I welcome the opportunity to speak because we have all been approached by people at our clinics who face huge problems paying their mortgages and clearing their debts.  As Deputy Joe Carey said, the Keane report is a starting point and it must be looked on as such.  From that starting point, the Government will be able to work out a manageable solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">However, before we get into the solution, it is important to realise we are not talking about statistics.  There is a temptation to talk about statistics, to box people into categories and so on.  The reality is that, in many cases, these are young families and recently married couples who took the advice of their local bank managers and were approved by the regional bank headquarters and who may have had jobs at the time.  They were encouraged by a now Opposition party and were told by a former general secretary of one of the then governing parties it was party time.  They built up massive accumulated debt not only for their houses but for cars, holidays and so on.  They feel let down and betrayed.  It is no wonder because at a time when they have this millstone of debt around their necks they see the bankers — I am not referring to people working in branches but those with serious levels of responsibility — walk away into the sunset with their golden handshake without any sign of retribution.  They see the same trend in respect of some former Ministers.  Members of the public are right to be outraged in this regard because they do not see why we, as a country, bailed out Anglo Irish Bank and all the other banks but left Joe and Mary Citizen landed with huge amounts of personal debt, which they need to clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">We have a stark choice.  Deputy Luke Flanagan was right in some of what he said, although not in most of it.  Do we put everybody out on to the side of the road or do we put in place a plan which will ensure we do not go back to the days of Captain Boycott?  In some instances, the local landlord is whatever Anglo Irish Bank is calling itself these days.  We do not want a situation where the modern day landlord puts people out on the side of the road.  We must avoid that and in so doing, we must be realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Debt forgiveness is not the panacea Deputy Luke Flanagan would have us believe nor is the Deputy's idea that we bring everybody out on the streets and pretend there is no debt problem.  When people go home, it still faces them and the reality will dawn on them the following morning like a big hangover.  This issue must be addressed realistically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">Some suggestions have been made, such as mortgage to rent and rent to buy.  We need to engage properly with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the local authorities and the housing associations and not pretend that because it is private debt, we cannot somehow engage with the local authorities and the housing associations to try to resolve this issue.  They have experience in this regard which needs to be tapped into, as has the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">In many cases, people are embarrassed when they come into one's clinic or when they meet one on the street.  They feel lucky to have a job but they have unmanageable debt and cannot cope with it.  They feel they have nobody to turn to.  The fact we are debating this issue gives these people some hope that when they come to our clinics, we listen to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">There is outrage among the public that the taxpayer has pumped huge amounts of money into the banks.  We know the banks have been recapitalised but the reality is they are not lending.  Two teachers came into my clinic last week, both of whom are in permanent jobs and are blue chip people.  However, they were refused mortgages by two of the banks we have recapitalised heavily.  They do not understand it as they are in jobs for life and will have pensions, that is if some people do not get their way and send us back to the Stone Age.  They cannot buy a house and yet the building industry is on its knees.  These people would like to borrow but the banks are not functioning.  That needs to be said here because there are very few opportunities when can say it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue of mortgage interest relief because it is hugely important.  It is also important to assure people that they will not be put out onto the side of the road.  We cannot afford to have a situation in which people are living in fear and do not know whether they will have a roof over their heads.  If anything comes out of this debate, I would like the Government to reiterate the commitment to protect the family home.  We all know of people who are struggling, who cannot sleep at night and who have children going to school.  We need to row in behind them and show solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">I echo much of what my colleague, Deputy Joe Carey, said.  All I ask is that the Keane report is looked at as a starting point because there is a temptation to come into the Chamber and say the Keane report has a lot of flaws and it is not everything we would like it to be.  I fully agree with some of what has been said but the reality is that people want a Government which listens to and empathises with them and which will put a plan in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">There is no doubt we have inherited the biggest basket case in Europe, although perhaps Greece and a couple of other countries are about to overtake us.  We have a serious economic problem and we need to be honest with the people rather than adopt the ostrich-type school of economics where one buries one's head in the sand and pretends one does not have a debt crisis when one does, some of which is sovereign debt and some of which is banking debt.  We need to address the crisis and to be very honest with people and not give them false hope because these are not statistics but are families and individuals in our constituencies who need our help.  In providing that help, the one thing they rely on is honesty because they did not get any degree of honesty over the past 14 years.  They were told to eat, drink and be happy.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_538">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1250">In the earlier part of my contribution last night, I referred to recent decisions which do not augur well for the delivery of mental health care in this State.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, is now charging mental health patients in the greater Dublin area for their medication which, up to now, was free of charge.  Under a scheme which was initially established by the former Eastern Health Board, all mental health patients received free psychiatric medication, including both medical card and non-medical card patients.  This has now ceased with non-medical card patients paying full costs up to the drugs payment scheme threshold of €120 per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">As I have stated before, this is a backward step and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, should intervene to reverse it.  It is an anomaly that such a scheme would apply to just one region in the State.  Patients, however, should not simply be cut off in this summary fashion, in some cases after many years of dependence on this scheme.  Many may go without essential medication as a result.  My colleagues in Sinn Féin and I have been contacted by extremely concerned people directly affected by this.  I am sure other Members, across all parties, have been contacted also.  The scheme should remain in place pending a thorough review of supports for mental health patients across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">In reply to a parliamentary question from me on this matter, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, stated in 2009 the HSE decided to bring the arrangements for the supply of medicines to patients attending mental health outpatient clinics in the greater Dublin area into line with those operating in the rest of the country.  While this may be the case, it came as a bolt from the blue to those in the Dublin and mid-Leinster area who lost access to this scheme from 1 November 2011.  They were simply not prepared for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">The Minister of State also stated in her reply that people affected by these changes who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the HSE will take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family, including the cost of medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">This is no different from their entitlement in any case.  If the Government will not reverse this change, will it at least, when assessing people's eligibility for a medical card, take into account the nature of their illness and the fact that, having benefited from a scheme in some cases for year, they are now forced back on their own resources?</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">In December 2009, I asked the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, what measures would be undertaken to ensure the roll-out of A Vision for Change.  It is interesting to compare the answer given then with the proposed amendment to this motion in the name of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  The previous Minister stated the HSE mental health capital programme would be funded from the proceeds of sales of former psychiatric institutions.  At that time, the proceeds of those sales amounted to €42 million according to the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister of State responding could indicate the current figure and if all of the proceeds will be ring-fenced for community-based facilities.  It is not clear if that is the case from the Government's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated there are 61 child and 124 adult community mental health teams working across the State, not all of which are fully staffed, which constitute the backbone of A Vision for Change project.  If they are not fully staffed, they are then not fully working.  The Minister of State said each team must have representation from several core areas including psychiatry, psychology, social work, occupational and other therapy and mental health nursing.  She intends the HSE implementation plan will include a strategy for restoring the multidisciplinary composition of the community teams to appropriate levels to deliver the required services in their respective areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">I welcome this statement as well as her stated intention last night that the recruitment moratorium will be breached to provide an additional 450 posts to implement A Vision for Change.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have signed off on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">I agree with the June 2011 TASC report, Eliminating Health Inequalities, which stated that while the programme for Government brings a much-needed renewed focus on mental health, the ring fencing of €35 million annually will do little more than extend existing pilot initiatives or support new initiatives on a pilot basis.  Sinn Féin has set out a more ambitious programme which includes developing health services on an all-Ireland basis, progressing from increased co-operation to integration of services on the island; improving accountability and transparency in planning and financing mental health service reform; modernising mental health legislation in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; promoting cross-departmental action to combat social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health problems; ring-fencing 12% of the annual Department of Health budget for mental health services in line with World Health Organisation recommendations; developing and promoting suicide prevention strategies; and ensuring provision of required child and adolescent community-based mental health services and ending the wholly inappropriate placement of children in adult inpatient facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The reference to asylum seekers and refugees in the motion is welcome.  Research carried out by consultant psychiatrists Dr. Niall Crumlish and Dr. Pat Bracken, presented last year to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, demonstrated alarmingly high levels of mental ill-health among persons seeking asylum.  Some of this can be traced to the inhumane treatment they receive during the asylum process.  Comprehensive reform of this system must be a central element of any effort to improve the mental health of this vulnerable population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">I support the demand for change to section 59 of the 2001 Mental Health Act.  This proposes to ban the use of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, on patients without their consent.  It is not acceptable this highly controversial and medically questionable procedure which impinges fundamentally on patents' rights should be imposed on patients without their consent but on the say-so of two psychiatrists.  Many people have been damaged by the use of these procedures in the past.  They emanate from a time when people with mental illness were treated like criminals and subject to incarceration, often in horrific conditions, and to medical experimentation.  Care of people with mental illness has been transformed for the better but these procedures remain.  It is long past time to deal with this issue.  ECT is among the issues addressed very comprehensively by Amnesty International in its review of the Mental Health Act 2001. I commend Amnesty's recommendations to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">The Government itself in its programme for Government made a commitment to review the Mental Health Act 2001 in consultation with service-users, carers and other stakeholders and to introduce a mental capacity Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Those commitments are welcome.  It is our responsibility to ensure they are delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The closure of St. Brigid's Home, Crooksling, Brittas, County Dublin, will affect 89 patients with various degrees of dementia, 67 of whom are high dependency.  While it has been signalled that Hollybrook community nursing unit, Inchicore, and other sites will take a number of these patients, many are still uncertain of their futures, which is a real concern to them and their families.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, gave an undertaking that she would facilitate a meeting with HSE and departmental decision-makers for representatives of the residents at Crooksling.  This still has not happened weeks after the Minister of State gave her commitment in the House.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, raise this matter with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who I know to be a sincere voice in this House, to come back to me on this eagerly sought meeting?</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment and to support the motion as tabled by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Independent Members of the Technical Group.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ColmKeaveney" eId="spk_539">
          <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1264">I thank some of the Members opposite for their contribution on this motion.  Members on all sides of the House have strong shared concerns in this area.  It is also a shared concern that one in four people is affected by mental health issues.  There go I but for the grace of God.  It is important that this Dáil takes whatever action is necessary to deliver critically important services within the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">I support and applaud the Minister's commitment with regard to the policy in the programme for Government.  It is the intention of this Government to break the perception that mental health services can only be delivered within an institutional environment of care.  We must tackle that but we must also ensure that we adequately resource the delivery of community based services and try to break from the perception that the only quality delivery can be done through the State agencies or the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">We must acknowledge the great work done by the voluntary and community sector in that regard.  I refer in particular to Outhouse, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community resource centre based in Dublin whose primary objective is to ensure that it can support clients of services with mental health issues.  Outhouse is a front-line service provider which provides a safe space where people can get information, support, organise and build capacity to act.  It is often the first point of contact for LGBT service users to find a safe space where they can talk about their concerns regarding emotional isolation, coming out, homelessness, alcohol and substance misuse and abuse, self-harm and suicide.  When I refer to community it is that type of model that we must extend above and beyond our effort to address the scourge and the great stealer that we know as mental health illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The current work as indicated to me in my discussions with representatives of Outhouse today involves a minimum investment on behalf of the State where often life-saving services can be delivered through volunteers and peers who can provide support and deliver a front-line service to what we would consider are marginalised people within our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">I welcome the great work of organisations such as Outhouse which refers its work across the sector in terms of the Garda gay liaison officers, the Public Interest Law Alliance, the HSE social inclusion unit and HSE mental health nurses within the community.  We must endeavour to work with and support those type of partnerships to ensure we deliver modern public services that deal with the emergence of mental health issues within that community.  There are great demands to ensure we increase resources to this community because the reality is that Irish society must deal with the stigma of mental health issues and the mental health issues associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">In future I would like to see organisations dedicated to mental health supported under the provisions of the proposed Government legislation.  In that regard there is a commitment in the programme for Government to retain and ring-fence spending under A Vision for Change, which provides for an additional ring-fenced €35 million annually from within the health service budget.  That is important in terms of sending out the signal that in austere times this Government is serious about debunking the notion that we do not wear the issue of mental health on our sleeves.  We are proud to associate ourselves with this issue.  It is not an issue we want to sweep under the carpet but one in which we want to invest to deliver critically important services to vulnerable people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  It is important for us as a Government to listen to what the Opposition has to say in this regard because there are some valid proposals in this area to which we must give serious consideration.</p>

        <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_540">
          <from>Deputy Gerald Nash</from>
          <p eId="para_1271">I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in the House in recent months but I welcome this debate on the importance of mental health and ensuring the resources are in place to help those with mental health issues across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">For far too long mental health issues were swept under the carpet and talked about in hushed and sometimes ignorant terms, if they were talked about at all.  President Bill Clinton spoke on the subject at length on occasion and once stated that mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of but stigma and bias shame us all.  This is an issue that does affect us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The most common and familiar manifestation of mental illness is depression.  Severe depression can cause paralysis not just of the soul but of the body as well.  Those who share their lives with victims of depression are also under incredible strain.  It is frightening to see one's loved ones suffering from depression or other forms of mental illness.  There can be a feeling of helplessness and of no longer being able to reach or recognise the person one loves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">My involvement and that of other Deputies across the north east is with the Save our Sons and Daughters, Sosad Ireland, organisation with which my colleague, Deputy Doherty, would be familiar.  It has brought home to me the urgent need to provide community based services and a community based approach to mental health in general.  It is essential that a strong and positive mental health policy should support not just the patients but also provide the families of patients with the knowledge and tools they need to help their loved ones.  The best way to do that is through primary care both through our health service but also by working with organisations such as Sosad Ireland, Aware, the Samaritans and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">We all agree that our current support system is far from perfect but many positive steps have been taken in recent years.  As Deputy Ó Caoláin stated, the era of hiding away or, worse, locking away patients is thankfully on its way out.  The vast majority of mental illness problems can and should be treated by primary care.  Hospital admission should be reserved for acute cases of severe illness.  A total of 90%of mental health problems are now treated at primary care level and the number of involuntary admissions to hospitals has decreased by over 30% in the past five years.  That is a credit to the changed conversation we have led in this country around mental health issues, and a change in attitudes also.  The recommendations outlined in A Vision for Change continue to be implemented as a series of speakers stated and the Government has committed to ring-fencing €35 million annually to develop the type of community health teams and services that are vitally needed across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">It is important also that we remind ourselves of the true aim of health care, which can be often lost on people.  The World Health Organisation states that health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.  We sometimes lose sight of that particular focus.  Too often we focus on the illness and not on the well-being.  With mental health issues, as with all health issues, prevention is much better than cure.  That is particularly relevant in the case of youth mental health services.  I am glad to see the HSE is continuing to support and is seeking to expand initiatives targeted at young people such as the Jigsaw programme with which many Deputies will be familiar.  Our end target must be to make that programme and others like it available across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">I am pleased that our recently elected President, Michael D. Higgins, has prioritised this area.  One of the first initiatives he intends to take is to have a presidential seminar, a national discussion, about what it means to be young in Ireland today and I am sure mental health will provide a focus for that particular discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">This country's new approach to mental health is a win-win for everybody.  A healthy society is a productive society.  Critics will quote statistics marking a reduction in percentage spend on mental health while sometimes conveniently ignoring the successful replacement of outmoded, anachronistic and hugely expensive hospital care with the more effective primary and community based care and interventions we have seen in more recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">Our services are far from perfect but I am proud to be part of a Government that is committed to making real improvements in this area, and continues to do so.  I am also very proud to be working alongside a Minister of the calibre of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who gets the mental health issue and has encouraged us all to take it on, break down the barriers and speak openly and freely about mental health in our society.  This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in the House and I commend the Technical Group for bringing it forward previously.  We spoke about it at length in recent months and I hope we continue to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_541">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_1280">I thank the Technical Group for bringing forward this motion because the more we talk about it and the more normal we make it as a condition the more acceptable it will be for ordinary people outside this House to talk about it and accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">On that basis I want to talk about stigma.  While one could discuss many topics related to mental health, stigma is particularly important because it lies at the root of the problem.  The word "stigma" in this context refers to the use of negative labels to identify people.  The stigma around mental health problems has its roots in fear and misunderstanding.  Many people hold negative opinions of people with mental health problems because they rely on myths, misconceptions and stories they were told when they were younger.  When I was child I often heard it said that my nanny, God rest her, was suffering with her nerves.  Years later when I thought about what my nanny went through, it became obvious that her problems were widely ignored and the solution was to label them as suffering with her nerves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I read a recent study entitled, Public Attitudes Towards Mental Health Problems, which showed that stigma was one of the most persistent barriers to understanding mental health problems and the importance of mental health.  I was curious about the medical meaning of the word "stigma" and when I looked it up I found it defined as "a cluster of negative attitudes and beliefs that motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses".  Stigma leads to low self-esteem, isolation and hopelessness and deters sufferers from seeking care and in some cases from even wanting it because their sense of hopelessness is so great.  It results in people with mental health problems internalising public attitudes and become so embarrassed or ashamed that they will often conceal their symptoms and fail to seek treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Three core issues arose from the study on social stigma, the first of which is a lack of knowledge and ignorance.  People in general have little understanding of mental health problems and much of the information they have is factually incorrect.  I adhere to the view that a picture paints a thousand words.  There is no substitution for real people telling real stories.  Messages with a Government or departmental spin are largely ignored whereas real people, even relatively famous people, with real stories have a much greater impact.  I refer to the recent case of Carol Hunt, a well-known journalist, whose open and honest comments on the issue resonated with me and many of my friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The second core issue to emerge from the study was negative attitudes or prejudice.  Anxiety, fear and a desire to avoid people with mental health problems are common feelings.  People do not want to sit down and discuss their innermost feelings, the fuzzy things they wish to avoid.  People with mental health difficulties expect a certain reaction from people.  It is human nature, therefore, that they will prefer to conceal the difficulties they are experiencing rather than face rejection or hostile behaviour from their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The final core point to emerge from the study was discrimination.  People with mental health difficulties must enjoy the same basic rights as everyone else, on an equal basis and without discrimination.  Treating people with mental health problems differently can result in social exclusion and the denial of rights in areas such as housing, employment and education.  It, therefore, creates disadvantage.  Only Government policy and action can change minds and perceptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The See Change programme is Ireland's national partnership to reduce stigma and challenge the discrimination associated with mental health problems.  Started by the previous Government in 2010, See Change continues to be Government policy and we will work with the 35 organisations in the See Change alliance which have banded together to promote responsible marketing of the programme's message.  The alliance works together to bring about positive change in public attitudes and behaviour towards people with mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">For some people, the stigma and discrimination associated with a significant mental health problem is almost as difficult to manage as the experience of being unwell.  It is vital that we provide an effective stigma reduction programme, one which incorporates all agencies and types of media and has the potential to bring about real change in the attitudes of normal people towards mental health problems.  While tackling the stigma associated with mental health problems will not be achieved overnight, the positive support of the See Change programme will and must effect change in society.  We must provide a real and positive transformation in how mental health problems are perceived.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_542">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_1288">I compliment Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the speeches they made last night.  Those who have not read them should do so.  As both the Minister of State and Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, mental health has become the Cinderella of the health system.  We believed the publication of A Vision for Change would deliver a new era, a new dawn and a new beginning and that all would be well as community based supports would be introduced and the gargantuan, horrific asylum approach to mental health services would end.  Unfortunately, our hopes have not been realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">I am confident the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will not walk away from the challenge of bringing about change and reform in the mental health service.  The benchmark of the Government will be whether it delivers in the area of mental health.  I say this having spent my entire life involved with people with intellectual disabilities.  Relatives and friends of mine have suffered from mental health problems.  I also worked as a porter in Cork University Hospital.  I have had the pleasure of seeing people recover and of meeting past pupils who had suffered from mental health problems and had the courage to say they were in trouble and needed help and proceeded to make a determined effort to recover.  Other friends did not make a recovery and did not complete the journey to a better place.  Unfortunately, some of them are no longer with us while others are up to their eyes in medication.  Over-prescribing and over-medication of patients are profound difficulties in the mental health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Given the importance of maintaining a cross-party approach to mental health services, it is regrettable that the House will divide on the motion.  If we are honest, this issue affects every one of us, whether at home, in our extended family or in our local community.  This is about the future and the Government leading, advocating and delivering a better mental health service.  Well-being is important and one's sense of well-being is affected by simple matters such as the sun shining or television programmes such as the news.  Deputy Regina Doherty spoke at length about stigma.  While we have made strides in eroding the stigma associated with mental health, we must do much more in this regard.  We need to change mindsets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">I welcome the Government's policy on developing primary care and related infrastructure.  The capital investment programme provides for the development of a new central mental hospital.  In addition, ten beds will be allocated for people with intellectual disability and the problem of children and adolescent mental health care will be tackled for the first time.  Four regional centres for mental health services will also be established.  Thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the capital funding envelope has mental health services at its core.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, to ensure the mental health intellectual rehabilitation unit for the south is located in Cork.  It is imperative that the GF ward in Cork University Hospital is demolished and rebuilt.  It is the only part of HSE south which has not been developed or modernised notwithstanding the great work done by staff on the ward.  I hope the delivery of mental health services in the south will be transformed in 2012 with the development of a new GF ward.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_1293">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  It is appropriate that Parliament should discuss an issue which would have been swept under the carpet not many years ago.  In former times the outcome for unfortunate patients could be appalling.  Among other things, they could be locked up in an institution or at home or, at best, branded as odd and avoided not only by neighbours and friends but also by family members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">Thankfully we now have become a more informed society and accept that we will all experience some form of poor mental health at some stage in our lives.  Informing ourselves and our children of the signs and symptoms of depression and the fact that help is available is crucial to dealing with the issue.  Nowadays, we can access mental health services in many settings, and the old taboos about depression are being slowly broken down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I would like to focus my remarks this evening on youth suicide.  As a young child and teenager living near a river, I became aware of suicide as two adults took their own lives in different years.  I must admit that suicide was not something that I thought a lot about since then, but in recent years the increase in suicide in Offaly, especially among our youths, has brought the issue into sharp focus.  It primarily occurs among young men, but young women too now appear to be resorting to death by suicide.  What are the reasons for this drastic step?  It is a challenge for society to deal with this.  There must be a growing feeling of hopelessness which is leading to increasing levels of alcohol and drug abuse, anti-social behaviour, homelessness, mental health problems and suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">There are now many organisations out there which support young people in particular.  Headstrong, SpunOut and other organisations are doing exemplary work in attempting to support youth mental health by enabling them to access systems and supports where needed.  The Jigsaw programme was designed by Headstrong and it is a wonderful programme that works on capacity building and in partnership with communities to support young people's positive mental health.  Communities from all over Ireland are availing of this wonderful project, and I am delighted that Offaly has been included in an expansion announced recently by the HSE.   We must be as proactive as possible in developing and supporting better services to support our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">Seventy five per cent of mental health difficulties emerge before the age of 24.  It is a long time since I was 24, but I can remember the feelings of being somebody of that age trying to find herself.  This is a critical period in a person's development and if we can identify issues as they emerge, then if we intervene at an early stage, we can prevent people from suffering a lifetime of pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The extension of the Jigsaw service means that young people will get help earlier and prevent unnecessary potentially very serious problems for them in their day to day lives.  It is a challenging subject and we need to innovate and come forward with novel and effective solutions.  The existing Jigsaw projects demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the stigma associated with mental health, remove barriers and design a service that works for young people by listening carefully to their ideas and react to their feedback.  This is the type of service that should be rolled out across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">I would like to refer to an excellent project carried out recently in Offaly to address mental health.  It was called "Let's talk about mental health" and it was carried on in collaboration between the HSE, the county council and the community forum.  There was a week of events across the county, in libraries and community halls, in which mental health issues were discussed.  It culminated in a wonderful family celebration on the final day, which was a great end to what was a difficult week when people talked about their experiences.  It should be experienced in other counties across the country.  I am sure an evaluation of the impact of that week will be carried out, and it should be referred to in future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_544">
          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_1300">I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for putting forward this motion.  I remember vividly the high walls around St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow so that nobody could see in or out, as well as the stigma attached to those who were signed in.  It was a regular comment to make in those days that a family had "signed in" their loved ones.  The torment associated with a public display of the fact that a family was not in a position to care for their loved ones was something they had to endure in their own community.  As somebody who worked in the vicinity of St. Dympna's Hospital, I can remember seeing the tractor going to the farm every day, and all those unfortunate people piled on the back of it going out to do a day's work, before going back home in the evening.  There was such dejection among those unfortunate people.  Many of them had been forgotten by their loved ones, while others were signed in for whatever reason, but were never given the opportunity to play an active role in their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">This stigma still exists to some extent.  I am concerned about what I see in my constituency, where we have low support and high support community accommodation.  In many instances, there is no link up with those people.  There is nobody available to ask them to come to the cinema or a game.  We often talk about community, but I wonder if we are involved with those in the community who are crying out for help in so many different ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">Some of these unfortunate people come into our clinics, and we have to give them the time to ensure that they feel wanted.  As elected representatives, we should lead the charge on involvement.  This debate should highlight the word "involvement".  We should not forget about them, irrespective of where they are.  We should not just talk about Age Action and all the other wonderful groups, but we should work with them.  Deputy O'Sullivan has brought forward a motion on this issue, but it should not be raised just once every term.  It should go back to the health committee and back in here again, if we feel that the actions are not being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">I fully support what the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch has been doing.  It is an ongoing problem in families.  I remember socialising on one occasion and I met a famous singer.  I started talking to him and he told me that he was in a difficult time.  I asked why that was the case.  It was in early July and the weather was good, but he said that his problem was that he would become manic depressive in a few weeks.  He was worried — in July — whether he would have a happy Christmas and if he could not get that out of his system, he would be depressed for the rest of the year.  It was hard to believe that this one question could put that man in such a position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">These are the challenges that face us.  We have a problem.  We should work with it and ensure that organisations with a community base should widen their involvement and include people who have suffered from their time in mental institutions, but who have since moved on.  We should help them to move to the next stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_545">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_1305">I wish to share time with Deputies Daly, Boyd Barrett, Catherine Murphy, Joan Collins and Tom Fleming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Two years ago, when I was Mayor of Waterford city, a huge conference took place on the subject of taking the stigma out of mental health, which was attended by about 500 people from all parts of Ireland.  There were some stunning statistics, which have been alluded to over the course of today's and last night's debate, regarding the number of people who have presented with mental health problems in Ireland — between 350,000 and 400,000.  There is also an unknown number who do not present themselves for treatment.  I acknowledge that this has already been brought to the attention of the Dáil by a number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Tonight I want to concentrate on the latest report from the independent monitoring group for A Vision for Change, which criticised, among other things, a disappointing lack of progress in specialist services for substance abuse problems.  These services, according to the IMG, have not received the priority and urgent attention they require.  The group mentioned the importance of dual diagnosis in the effective treatment of addiction, which cannot be overstated, because at least half of people with addiction problems have coinciding mental health problems which often go undiagnosed and untreated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">What I and the IMG cannot understand is why, given the commitment in the programme for Government to ring-fence €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services, we still have no community-based mental health service similar to the community-based drugs initiatives, CBDIs, which cater for those with addiction issues.  CBDI workers are not psychologists or psychiatrists; they are not trained or equipped to deal with the complexity of mental health issues.  Yet, at the moment, 50% of those who present to the service with addiction concerns also have mental health problems, so it does not make sense that we do not have a similar community-based initiative for mental health problems.  This is what is urgently required: community-based mental health services that work in tandem with the local drugs projects to offer people access to psychological and social services for mental health treatment, not just biological and medical interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">Not only are community mental health services more accessible to people living with severe mental disabilities, they are also more effective in taking care of their needs compared with mental hospitals, as has been stated by many previous speakers.  The strengths of CBDIs are that they are community-based, community-driven, and less sterile than a hospital environment.  They are informal yet confidential and they offer a holistic approach.  Taking all this into consideration, the Government should rethink its strategy on community-based programmes.  It is also important that people can go through the service at a first point of contact and then be referred, if required, back to the community service for support.  This would remove the stigma, as has been mentioned by many people, that is associated with attending psychiatric treatment wards.  Furthermore, psychiatric wards are not always the correct environment for those with mental health issues, as it may not be appropriate for them to mix, for example, with those who are going through the detoxification process.  What CBDI workers are telling me is that because of the lack of mental health services within the community, a significant number of people with mental health issues are using illegal drugs to self-medicate.  That is something the Government should examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to address a number of other issues.  As a member of Amnesty International, I thank that organisation for highlighting many mental health issues in Ireland over the last number of years.  I also want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who I know from personal conversations is determined to push forward projects in the area of mental health.  However, I am disappointed, based on the report from the monitoring group of A Vision for Change, that we have not established community-based programmes on the ground similar to the drugs initiatives.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_1311">There are many issues about which we can make the criticism that there is a lot of talk and not enough action.  Ironically, the area of mental health is one in which there is not enough talk, although that does not mean there is enough action.  It is one important area in which talking is a positive thing as it allows issues to be aired.  It is important that we are having this debate because of the points made about the stigma that still surrounds the issue of mental health.  As a shop steward in a previous job for many years, I represented people who were out of work sick, and never once did a doctor write on the certificate that mental health issues were involved.  There were always other reasons put forward for the person's absence because of the fear of stereotyping.  One of the messages from this debate is that there is nothing embarrassing whatsoever about mental health problems; they are perfectly normal.  At least one in four people will experience such problems at some stage, and they can be dealt with.  We were laughing here at the number of Deputies who said they had friends with these problems; we were thinking that maybe they were not actually friends at all.  I have no problem in saying that I myself have suffered from depression.  I have taken medication for depression on occasion; I have dealt with it, and now I am grand.  Many other people in Irish society are the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">It is important that we talk about these issues, in the House and outside it, but this is not enough.  The talking must be backed up with action.  I do not think it is good enough that A Vision for Change has been lying on the shelf for five years even when it must be admitted it is not that visionary in its approach.  It was a repeat of a policy that was already in place, Planning for the Future, which was not that radical.  It was concerned with the provision of treatment and care for people primarily in the communities they come from so that they would not have to be locked up and institutionalised.  However, the resources were not provided to back up that policy and make it a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">It is appalling that these policy changes were not implemented during the boom.  It is important to stress the need to protect the funding — €35 million — for community health teams and so on but given the stresses being experienced by people due to the recession, there needs to be more to respond to the crisis.  The current economic situation is putting major pressure on people mentally and emotionally and contributing to mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">We cannot see the issue in isolation.  It is clear that more staff are needed to deal with it.  We cannot divorce this issue from the public sector recruitment embargo, which needs to be addressed, because decisions are being made without taking into account the views of staff at the front line.  They are concerned that the resources will not be available to adequately run the new units that are being promised but they are not being listened to.  It is not just lip service that we need.  We need action and investment.  It is impossible to deal with this issue while the public sector recruitment embargo remains in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">I would like to step back and consider how society as a whole deals with the issue of mental health and the role of psychiatric drugs.  Serious issues are currently being debated, including whether psychiatric medications alter the long-term course of mental health disorders for the better or for the worse.  Do they increase the possibility that a person will be able to function well, or that he or she will end up with a disability?  Could it be the case that a person with a mild disorder has a bad reaction to an initial drug which puts him or her on the path to long-term disability?</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">We must be careful in this regard, because research from the United States shows that mental illness disability rates have doubled since 1987 and increased sixfold since 1955, while psychiatric drug use greatly increased in the 1950s and 1960s and has skyrocketed since 1987, when Prozac was introduced.  These pharmaceutical companies make billions of dollars, and anti-psychotic drugs are far and away the biggest money-spinners.  Evidence suggests they are useful for short-term treatment but in the long term they can increase problems.  There are worrying trends, in particular of children being prescribed such medication and this is something we must attend to.  We must determine who controls health and who decides on these things.  Is this being done in the interests of the big multinational corporations to earn a profit or is it being done for the benefit of the individual and for society as a whole?  We must examine the role of transparency in decision-making in this regard and we must seek to enable people to make decisions for themselves.  People should be able to make an informed choice about all of the treatments available.  There is a role for drugs, for counselling and for other supports.  People should get the entire package and should be informed not only of the short-term impacts, but also of the long-term impacts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1318">I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on putting forward this motion.  This could not be a bigger issue.  One quarter of the population are affected at some time by mental health issues.  We have all been touched by it.  I have been touched by the impact of it as have people close to me.  Let us consider the link, although not inevitable, to depression and alcohol-related abuse, both of which have been seriously on the rise in recent years.  It is important that we address this because it has been a significant problem and, as Deputy Daly has suggested, it has been growing for the past 20 or 30 years but it has dramatically worsened in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">Without getting into a complex analysis of these difficult issues. it is clear that there is some causal link between unemployment, economic dislocation, poverty and mental health issues.  In addition there has been a rise in the levels of suicide, alcohol abuse, other drug abuse and so on.  While I have no wish to rehearse the economic debates we have in here every day of the week, this matter cannot be dealt with seriously and no commitment to deal with this issue can be taken seriously unless we address such issues as unemployment urgently.  If there are 300,000 or 400,000 people in the country with no hope of work then this problem will get worse.  The levels of depression will rise, the rates of suicide will increase, drug and alcohol abuse will get worse and all the costs of all of these problems will get worse as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">Although we have these problems, we know they can be helped by the provision of mental health services.  However, this State is failing to make a priority of the provision of these services.  We all acknowledge we should do so but in reality we are not doing it.  Some 5% of the health budget in the State goes on mental health services as against a budget of 12% in Northern Ireland and an average of 8% throughout Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">A Vision for Change was not a bad document.  Nor was it a brilliant document or the last word on this issue but even this document has not been implemented.  Some 60% of child psychiatry teams continue to await the funds and the staffing they need.  Child mental health protection is of particular importance since it is preventative and it will prevent greater costs and more damage in the long term.  School counselling services are practically non-existent and school principals regularly tell parents that there is a quota of only two children per year per school to be seen by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  Up to three quarters of all mental health problems begin between the ages of 12 and 25 years.  However, the roll-out of Jigsaw walk-in centres for adolescents and young adults is painfully slow with only five centres open at present.  There are no functioning child psychiatry teams for children with severe intellectual disabilities, as promised by the A Vision for Change document.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">I put it to the Minister that under any universal health insurance, mental health will not be prioritised because it is not a profit-making area.  This is the case in such places as the United States.  Mental health treatment is manpower-heavy and, therefore, a recruitment embargo disproportionately hits the delivery of mental health services because of its reliance on manpower.  The cuts in staffing levels will force more people into dependence on drugs which, as Deputy Daly correctly stated, represents a concerning way to deal with the problem.  To deal with the problem effectively, we need more psycho-social interventions, social workers, occupational therapists, psychotherapists and so on.  I appeal to the Government to take this issue seriously.  The Government acknowledges that we must deal with the issue.  I emphasise my disbelief at the fact that the Government has amended the motion.  Given all that those in Government have said, I do not understand why they are playing politics with this motion when there is nothing controversial in it and many speakers on the Government side have endorsed it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1323">I wish to draw attention to the amendment and express my dissatisfaction that the amendment does not specifically deal with the area of addiction.  One cannot deal properly with mental health issues without dealing with the area of addiction.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, criticised the HSE for withdrawing services today.  It should be a matter of real concern that there is no connection between the HSE and the Minister of State's Department in respect of these services at a time when we are being told that heroin addiction is on the rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">Today, I invited to the House a group which has previously met some of the County Kildare Deputies.  The group is based in Kildare.  It is made up of a fantastic group of people who are all in recovery from addiction.  Some of them are back in education having returned after being addicted for a long time.  They are keen to ensure that they play a positive role in assisting others, especially in County Kildare.  I am referring to the Addiction Services Kildare Users Forum.  One of the most revealing things they produced was a map of the services in Kildare.  They placed four stars on the map around the county signifying where the services are provided.  There were two level 2 doctors and a detox unit in Athy.  Most people from Kildare are obliged to travel to Dublin for these services.  I realise no community is queueing up to get addiction services within their community and the issue must be handled sensitively but there is a real and practical issue to be addressed.  In a county such as Kildare with 209,000 people, including west Wicklow, there are inadequate services at the point where people can easily access them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">One must be very determined to deal with an addiction problem and if it is not made reasonably easy then the opportunity can be lost.  For example, today I heard about a couple who must travel every day from Athy to Pearse Street.  They take the journey in turns because they are on a methadone programme.  That is simply not sustainable.  However, they have come forward with some practical proposals which I hope to bring to the Minister.  These are small changes which would not be particularly expensive to implement.  I hope there will be a positive response to such situations because treatment is not simply a matter of dealing with an addict.  One must deal with his or her family and friends and one must also deal with a reduction in health services and crime and prison services.  Sometimes it is a matter of putting in place simple things to make it easy for people to deal with addiction and this can have a large influence not only for the individual, but for the community.  I was hugely impressed with the group but its members, as volunteers and recovering addicts, want to play a positive role in their community in assisting other people.  We have to resource such people.  If they are coming forward to do such work we should be going out of our way to assist them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Some decades ago Tony Gregory outlined, during recessionary times, the terrible problems in the north inner city of Dublin.  They have spread because there was not a timely and appropriate response.  We can see how the problem has escalated and is much more difficult to contain.  When positive things come forward, particularly from people like the group to which I refer, there must be a positive response.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1327">There are many failings in our health system and those in the area of mental health are appalling.  It is an historic issue for the nation.  The treatment of people with mental health problems illustrates an appalling failure by the State, comparable to its failure to protect children.  I get a shiver down my spine when I hear Government Ministers talk about protecting the most vulnerable in society when the records and facts are there.  The most vulnerable, namely children and the mentally ill, have been abandoned by the State over the past decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">An unequal society, alongside an unequal health service, does not make for a healthy society.  The rate of hospitalisation for mental illness among unskilled workers is six times that of higher professional groups and ten times that of employers or managers.  Those figures come from the health inequality on the island of Ireland 2007 report.  The poorer layers of society suffer more from mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">The programme of austerity has hit the poorest sections of society hardest.  It will increase inequality and add to the stress, worry, poor diet and low self-esteem which are key factors in causing mental health problems. At the same time that cuts are affecting mental health services people, only 9% of staff in HSE work in the area of mental health yet it is has experienced 50% of staff cuts.  It is a Cinderella syndrome which has to be discussed in the open.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The Government claims there has been significant progress in the implementation of the 2006 strategy, A Vision for Change, stressing particularly improved child and adolescent health services.  That jars with two facts.  There are 200 children in adult inpatient units.  Assessment waiting lists for children and adolescents rose by 14% this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">I have found the experience of older men and women availing of public psychiatric services is also appalling.  I know of a person who had psychiatric counselling with a different person each month.  The person came into contact with young people in the system and there was no continuity of care.  Older people found it difficult to talk to young men or women who do not have the experience to assist them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Dependency on tablets such as Prozac creates other problems such as impotence and can affect mental health and self-esteem.  We have to seriously examine those areas.  Community based mental health services must be in place, linked to the national understanding of mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">I welcome the fact the Government benches welcome the motion, that €35 million has been ring-fenced and that clinical care programmes will continue.  More austerity is being implemented by the IMF and EU, through the Government.  There is more joblessness and more people are stressed out by the mortgage crisis and possible evictions and dealing with all the problems associated with that.  There will be more stress, inequality and depression.  Mental health problems will need to be reviewed, not just in terms of policy but to determine what the needs of our society will be the next number of years.</p>

        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1334">I will illustrate the situation at a local level in my constituency of Kerry South which mirrors the national situation.  There is a continuing exodus of nursing staff from Kerry mental health services which has resulted in the loss of over 50 nursing posts over the past three years.  There are a further 30 retirements expected before the end of February 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">This will leave the service chronically understaffed and even more dependent on overtime to deliver what is becoming an often basic and fractured mental health service for the people of Kerry.  If the recruitment of nursing staff is not commenced before 2012 many parts of the service will have to be closed or abandoned as there will not be enough nurses to sustain even the most basic services in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">At a national level, more than 1,500 psychiatric nursing posts have been lost from 2009-11.  This is disproportionate to the reduction in staff numbers in disciplines throughout the public service.  The resulting reduction in the budget for mental health services has seen expenditure fall from €800 million in 2006 to €700 million in 2011.  As a percentage of the overall health budget expenditure on mental health has fallen from 8.5% in 1980 and 1990 to 4.9% today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">In comparison, Northern Ireland spends 11% of its health budget on mental health, well in line with WHO recommendations which advocate that 12% of a nation's health budget be spent on mental health services.  In monetary terms for every euro spent on mental health in the Republic, €2.30 is spent in Northern Ireland.  The Republic's current percentage spend of 4.9% on mental health puts it firmly in the third world league.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">To further illustrate the point, the Irish mental health service have been described by the human rights organisation, Amnesty International, as a service under siege and compared it to the Gaza Strip.  Overtime is currently being used throughout Kerry mental health services in an effort to staff the various wards and units.  If the amount of money spent on overtime was instead diverted to the recruitment of nursing staff it would pay for 23 first year nurses with money to spare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">The spending of money on staff recruitment rather than overtime and agency staff as the first option would offer better value for money to the service and the country.  It is obvious that the current recruitment ban on the direct employment of psychiatric nurses by the HSE is costing more and is therefore counter-productive.  To alleviate the current chronic shortage of psychiatric nurses I propose the extension of the timeframe for the implementation of the revised pension lump sum calculations based on the public service pay cuts.  It would stem the rush to retire before 29 February 2012 and allow for a more controlled and orderly departure of staff nearing retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">If the moratorium on the recruitment of psychiatric prices was lifted 1,000 psychiatric nurses could be recruited by the HSE on a cost-neutral basis.  The implementation of these proposals would have an immediate positive impact on mental health services at a local level in Kerry and nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">I thank the Minister for his reply to a parliamentary question I tabled.  I asked him to provide capital funding for the replacement facilities to be put in place to complete the necessary closure of St. Finan's Hospital in Killarney.  I ask him to pay special attention to it.  The commitment he gave that the money will be made available sounds positive.  I expect him to honour the commitment.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_552">
          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
          <p eId="para_1342">I am delighted to have an opportunity to address the important issue of mental health provision in the State.  I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Technical Group for putting forward the motion on Private Members' business.  This subject is obviously close to the hearts of many Members and the contributions last night and again this evening have been both extensive and impressive.  Another feature of the debate which cheers me is the strong cross-party support for A Vision for Change and the many efforts of this Government to put renewed impetus into the implementation of that policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">Our counter-motion and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch's, contribution last night summarise the Government position on this issue.  As the Minister of State pointed out, A Vision for Change was widely welcomed on its publication in 2006 as a progressive, evidence-based and realistic document which offered a new model of service delivery for mental health that was patient-centred, flexible and community-based.  Since then, a great deal of progress has been made in closing many of the old psychiatric hospitals and providing modern acute inpatient as well as community-based facilities and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">We must ensure that we fast-track the remainder of the strategy set out in A Vision for Change.  To do this we will have to provide more and better mental health services via primary care and in the community.  There must be a cultural shift away from the overly medical model of the past to an all-embracing therapeutic and person-centred service that is focused on recovery.  This will include an increased focus on the provision of counselling services.  In this regard, it is my intention to introduce a system for regulating the provision of counselling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">A point that has been made numerous times but bears repeating is that one in four of us will experience some mental health problem in our lifetime.  The message is clear; we must mind our mental health every bit as much as, if not more than, our physical well-being.  The Government has demonstrated its commitment to mental health from the start, with the programme for Government including several commitments in this regard.  These include the ring fencing of €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services.  We are also committed to ensuring patients can access mental health services such as psychologists and counsellors in the primary care setting.  Early, appropriate and effective intervention is our key message.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">My Department and the Health Service Executive are locked into a process of identifying specific aspects of A Vision for Change and Reach Out which we can target in order to apply resources in a planned, proactive fashion in the next three years.  I have asked for timelines, detailed costs, structures and identifiable responsible persons in order to prioritise and drive the necessary change.  I will not accept "cannot" or "will not" as an answer.  This is too important.  It is my intention that the issue of a directorate of mental health services, as referred to in the debate last night, will be dealt with in this context.  I am also anticipating recommendations in the area of clinical care programmes across the spectrum of care pathways, including dedicated services to deal with complex psychological conditions such as eating disorders which are all too common and have devastating effects on individuals and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, set out our position on the staffing of the child and adult community mental health teams.  These teams must include expertise from all the core disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, social work, occupational and other therapies as well as mental health nursing.  It must be primarily a people-based, multidisciplinary provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">Many mental health issues surface first in our early years.  We must ensure such difficulties do not catch hold of and destroy the lives and potential of young people.  The HSE provides a range of services across primary care, specialist child and adolescent mental health services, health promotion and suicide prevention services which support young people's mental health.  I am particularly pleased with specific initiatives in this area such as the Jigsaw programme, which was designed by Headstrong and its panel of youth advisers and is an evidence-based, integrated model designed to strengthen a community's capacity to support young people's mental health.  The most powerful comment I can make on the project is that it works.  Jigsaw is up and running in five counties and an additional €1 million in innovation funding was allocated to Headstrong in 2011 to support the expansion of Jigsaw to a further six areas.  Further initiatives aimed at addressing young people's mental health include the National Office for Suicide Prevention's public education campaign, centred around the platforms of "Your mental health" and "Let someone know", which is specifically targeted at a younger audience.  Both of these campaigns are critically important in getting the right messages out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The Government's commitment to mental health is reflected in our capital plan, which includes approval for funding to build a new central mental hospital.  One of the Members opposite mentioned the vulnerable in society.  Our commitment to the national paediatric hospital addresses the needs of children, who comprise a particularly vulnerable group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">Under the primary care strategy, primary care teams in each of the primary care centres will include specialist personnel to deal with mental health issues.  By offering these services in a primary care team setting, we can help to remove the stigma associated with mental health problems.  People with mental health concerns will be dealt with in the same way as anybody with any other health issue.  They will walk in the same door and share the same services.  That has already happened in some locations, such as Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">Another aspect of the Government's work in this area is the ongoing review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We recently established a steering group, with representatives from my Department, the HSE and the Mental Health Commission, to oversee the review.  The terms of reference for the review include examination of the general operation of the Act since commencement.  Importantly, the group is also tasked with reviewing whether A Vision for Change could or should be underpinned by legislation.  The group must also consider the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The public consultation phase of the review has been completed.  More than 90 submissions were received, with some 25 or more of those coming from individual service users or their carers.  The steering group is now conducting a series of meetings with key stakeholder groups.  I look forward to an interim report on all of these matters by the end of this year.  We hope to have the review completed by mid-2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">I thank all Members who contributed to this important debate.  I assure the House again of this Government's firm commitment to the reform and modernisation of our services in line with A Vision for Change.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_553">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1353">There seems to be a broad consensus that mental health provision deserves special attention and should not be neglected.  The Minister's speech and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, set out the Government's position quite clearly.  The Minister of State observed:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1354">The State has an obligation to its citizens to mind them and ensure, in as far as it is possible, they are enabled to attain the highest possible quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">She went on to stress that mental health must become part of the primary care infrastructure.  She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1356">Early intervention in a wrap-around system involving community, friends and low level counselling and psychology is what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Both the Minister and the Minister of State spoke about the importance of changing social attitudes and behaviours and stressing that mental illness is not a lifelong condition.  We all accept that society must learn to treat people with mental health problems as fully fledged members of society with a contribution to make, rather than seeing them as burdens.  The burden of financial debt and, in many cases, unemployment is an additional strain on people.  The current recession increases pressure on those already struggling with mental health problems and may lead to problems for people who did not previously experience difficulties with their mental health.  Deprivation, poverty and unemployment are linked to mental health, and the economic problems the country is facing create a difficult situation for many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">Barnardos has pointed out that despite the Government's commitment to continuing the strategy set out in A Vision for Change, its implementation has been slow and is likely to decline further.  It points to recent reductions in mental health spending to just 5% of the overall health budget compared with an internationally recommended figure of 12%.  Barnardos also observed that we still have cases where children are placed in adult psychiatric facilities at a vulnerable time in their young lives.  I am sure the Minister will agree that is not a satisfactory situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">There is broad agreement as to how we proceed from here in regard to mental health provision, but the challenge is to ensure the HSE succeeds in delivering community-based mental health care.  The policy of moving to a community health care service has been around for a while, but successive Governments have done little to implement it.  There must be an obligation on the HSE to deliver community health care services.  Colm O'Gorman and Karol Balfe of Amnesty International Ireland have stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1360">A progressive framework for mental health services is set out in A Vision for Change and this was widely endorsed and welcomed by stakeholders and people with mental health problems.  Community mental health services can provide the specialised supports which mean that individuals with severe or chronic mental health problems can recover while living in their community.  They also provide a wide range of supports that would not have been the case in traditional psychiatric hospitals.  The Government should ensure that this policy is delivered by enacting legislation to ensure it happens.  Legislation will demonstrate that we are serious about reform.  It should require the health services to ensure a move from an over-reliance on inpatient care to comprehensive and community-based multidisciplinary services.  The need for a new approach to accountability for implementation of A Vision for Change is clear.  This can be achieved by: introducing a statutory obligation on the HSE to publish an appropriate implementation plan for A Vision for Change and to provide comprehensive and community-based mental health services in line with that plan to the maximum of available resources; and introducing statutory measures to require greater transparency and accountability from the HSE for expenditure on mental health through detailed annual reporting.  The statutory obligation should stipulate the level of detail to be included in such a plan including measurable targets, milestones, outcomes and indicators as well as clear timeframes and details of the funding, human resources and infrastructure needed for implementation, and giving statutory powers to the Mental Health Commission to regulate, approve and inspect community mental health teams.</p>

        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_554">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1361">Obviously I think this is an excellent motion as I would not have signed my name to it otherwise.  Many interesting things have been said and this is what I have to say about it.  There is no doubting that there have been many improvements in our approach to the issue of mental health in the past half century or so.  An elderly relative of mine informed me — I was shocked when I first heard it — that in the 1950s they witnessed a man with mental illness being loaded onto a boat to Liverpool in what was, in effect, a cage.  I have also heard stories that in the 1940s people with mental illness were housed on straw in some mental hospitals and hosed down in a communal fashion in order to wash them.  One could only conclude that if one was not suffering from a mental illness before one went into a mental institute then one certainly would be afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">The town I come from had up until the mid-1990s a mental hospital called St. Patrick's and known as St. Pat's.  It was the last place on the planet that anyone would have wanted to end up.  In fact it was used as a threat and term of abuse to suggest that one might "end up there" as the saying goes.  In 1988 a few years before it closed my father was given the contract by the health board to replace the wooden steps on one of the stairwells.  I was given the job by my father of being the gofer.  At 16 I finally got to see what was behind the walls of St. Pat's.  While not being anywhere near as bad as I had heard from the 1940s, it was nonetheless bleak.  I always remember one particularly striking thing and that was seeing men and women leaning against a wall and rocking back and over for hours on end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">It was so bleak that when my father had finished the job it left an indelible mark on me that lasts to this day.  As a result, my biggest fear of suffering from a mental illness would not be the illness itself but the fear of having to engage with the services.  The hospital appeared to be arranged in such a way that the higher up the floors one was then the more ill one was classified.  The hospital was closed in 1996 whereupon many of the residents were moved out into the community and others who were not suitable placed in other institutions such as Ballinasloe.  When they tried to move people into the community, some people, including neighbours of mine, objected because they were scared of them, but fortunately not anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">The hospital was replaced with a prison.  I was, under protest, an inmate at that prison on two occasions for a short time.  While the name of the institution had changed much had remained the same.  The place was as bleak as ever in fact slightly more so.  On many occasions I came across people who were obviously mentally ill.  I met one man who was leaning against a wall and rocked back and over manically similar to what I had seen in the same building when it was a mental hospital.  The question is as follows.  When the State decided to close the hospitals did it make adequate resources available for the people who were formerly housed at the institution?  A report done by the <i>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine</i> found that 60% of females and 35% of males have suffered some form of psychological illness.  So even though we had officially moved away from a particular type of institution for treating people with mental illness, many have just ended up being treated in the same way as always except we now call them criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">One of the main reasons I feared mental institutions so much is because at a very young age I suffered from depression.  I spent evenings when I was younger when all I was capable of doing was staring into the fire for hours on end.  At the time it was considered preposterous by a great many people that one could suffer from depression as a young person.  I remember a nun in my school saying: "What are you on about?  Don't be daft."  The irony of it all.  Another fear I had of the institutions was that I had heard people had been put in there for being different.  As a child and to this very day I could justifiably be described as an eccentric so this added further to my fears.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">It was not until I was 23 years of age that I tried to deal with my mental health issues.  I went into my GP in Galway and told the doctor in question how I was finding life a struggle.  I told the doctor that I had motivational problems — by the way I was not smoking cannabis at the time — and that no matter what I did I found life to be struggle.  I had even contemplated suicide.  Deputy Clare Daly laughed at me earlier when I told her that only reason I did not commit suicide was that I did not have the motivation to do it, which is bad.  The doctor in question unfortunately knew nothing about me.  They never asked me about my diet.  They never asked me if I did any exercise.  They never asked me how I spent my days.  In fact all I was asked was whether I would like to take Prozac.  I was given a prescription and told to come back in a couple of weeks.  Fortunately I never took the tablets.  I am not saying that is the answer, but for me it was.  However, the idea that I would have to take tablets inspired me to find another solution.  I immediately took up exercise by running five miles per day and changed to a diet which meant that I was getting everything that was essential to a body working well.  As the saying goes, a healthy body leads to a healthy mind.  That has certainly been the case for me.  From listening to some people in the mental health profession one would think that all has changed since I went looking for help in the mid-1990s.  However, from talking to people in my constituency clinic over the past eight years it is quite clear that people are still being offered tablets as a first rather than as a last resort.  This is something which must change.  I do not know how many times I have heard of people being given tranquillisers in order to deal with grief.  How can one grieve when up to one's eyeballs in drugs?  Surely it should be normal to be hysterical after losing a loved one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">Ultimately prevention is better than cure and from an economic point of view it is infinitely cheaper.  An individual can only do so much in order to prevent mental illness.  A responsibility also rests with the State and society.  We must develop a society which does not treat people like a cog in an economic machine.  We must look at ways in which the inevitable stress of life can be minimised.  However, at the moment we are going in the opposite directions.  Bullying has become an acceptable way to progress in life.  This should come as no surprise as the very idea of capitalism is based on the survival of the fittest — in other words the crushing of the weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">One of the most popular shows on television at the moment is "X-Factor".  This show is based on demeaning people.  It deliberately sets out to expose, in the most public way possible, performers' imperfections upon which a crowd of people savage them by booing them.  There is also "The Apprentice" with Bill Cullen, the entrepreneur as he keeps calling himself, where bullying is just par for the course and the person who can put up with his bullying the best ends up getting a job.  We have the same thing on "Dragons' Den" where people's ideas are trashed and the more demeaning the dragon is the better.  Imagine if that went on in the schoolyard.  It would not be allowed.  However, it is inevitable that this philosophy on life will be taken up by children in the playground as well as by budding entrepreneurs who see this as the only way to succeed.  If such a philosophy is allowed to pervade, it is inevitable that we will live in a more stressful society and as a result end up with extensive mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">Obsession with body image is something which is causing major problems in mental health.  While this used to be more particular to women, it is now spreading to men.  I pity any young woman who has to live in this environment whereby if she is not a size zero then she is a failure.  Magazines such as <i>Heat</i> etc. are exceptionally damaging to the mental health of this generation.  They publish close-ups of women’s legs taken by the low-life paparazzi that are done in such a way as to highlight cellulite.  I ask Deputies to remember that cellulite is bad.  It is a modern symbol of failure unlike in the past where it was sign that one was not afraid to eat one’s dinner.  This inevitably leads to insecurities in women which make them feel somewhat inferior.  In many cases it leads to mental illness.  There is also the issue of financial stress, which I will not get a chance to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">Our latest end of pipe solution to dealing with mental health issues in Ireland is A Vision for Change, a document first published in 2006. Its goal was to make mental health services in Ireland person-centred, recovery-orientated, holistic, community-based, multi-disciplinary and population-based.  While these are laudable goals they require extra resources.  When the document was first published it was stated that for the strategy to be implemented 2,000 extra staff would need to be employed.  This has not happened.  The health service has instead taken on thousands of new administrative staff.  Not only have extra staff not been recruited but staff are currently being let go and not replaced.  I am told that locally in Roscommon one-third of staff will have left the service by next March.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, talk about this issue.  She appears to speak with genuine compassion and concern.  The ball is now in her court.  We need to treat the issue of mental illness seriously.  We need to treat it with the urgency with which one treats a cancer patient or a person with a heart problem.  We need, by the end of her term as Minister of State, for people to be able to genuinely open up about mental issues without feeling shame or, more important, without being made feel shame.  As things stand, that is not the case.  I implore the Government to do something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">The Technical Group has decided, in order that this issue be depoliticised, that there is no need to vote on this motion.  It is too important an issue to be made a political football of.  The only thing that needs a kicking here is our old attitudes to mental illness.</p>

         the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 24 who after winning an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, for additional special needs assistant support in July, is still waiting for the increase in SNA classroom hours to be implemented; the number of similar cases there are in which children who have won their appeal are still awaiting the agreed supports.

            <p eId="para_1374">Section 29 of the Education Act provides for an appeal to be taken against a refusal to enrol a child in a recognised school, however, such appeals do not consider the level of supports or resources applying to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools.  A Section 29 appeal for this child, who was partially enrolled, was upheld in July of this year. The NCSE was requested by the school to reconsider the allocation of SNA support which had been made for this child with a view to increasing the allocation.  This request was made subsequent to the school having been advised of its SNA allocation for the coming school year, which is 7.74 SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">A decision in respect of the application for increased SNA support for the school concerned, to take into account this child's increased attendance, is expected shortly.  As the child is not attending school on a full-time basis the NCSE will prioritise this application.  In the interim the school should be in a position to provide for the child's care needs from their existing level of SNA support, pending the outcome of this application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1407">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 38 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">In arriving at my decision in relation to the location of headquarters of the merged VECs, I considered a range of factors including the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">In addition to the head offices which I have announced, I have decided to maintain a number of sub offices where staff redeployment from the head office of an existing VEC to the head office of the relevant Education and Training Board is precluded because of the distance requirements provided for under the Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">I expect that while headquarters staff employed in offices which have not been designated as a head office or a sub office of an Education and Training Board will move to the designated headquarters location as soon as feasible, these offices will remain open for some time and the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">I am anxious to ensure that swift progress continues to be made in the work of bringing about a reduction in the number of VECs.  In this regard, while my decision in relation to the locations of head offices and sub offices is final, I want to make clear that my Department will not be forcing any one size fits all approach to staff deployment and office accommodation by the new Education and Training Boards. I will be receptive to any reasonable and sensible arrangements that are the best fit for the needs of the areas served by the new board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1413">I am committed to the continuation of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) was introduced to schools in 1995, designed to address the needs of students who would not be progressing directly to higher education, and for whom the established Leaving Certificate is unsuitable. The rate of early school leaving at that time, as evidenced in the 1996 ESRI Annual School Leaver Survey of 94/95 leavers  was 19.2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The latest ESRI School Leavers Survey was published in 2007 of 2004/5 leavers, and shows an early leaving rate of 14%. In May 2011 my Department published a report on retention rates to completion of Leaving Certificate showing  an early school leaving rate of 12% overall, in terms of the proportion who began their second level schooling in 2004 and completed it by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">While the improvements in retention rates cannot be attributed uniquely to the Leaving Certificate Applied, the programme has played a very important role in providing an active and vocationally oriented learning programme which has been successful in stimulating and engaging learners at risk, and enabling them to complete senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The unit cost of a place on a Youthreach programme for early school leavers is estimated at €18,553 per annum.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1419">The issue to which the Deputy refers relates to the change in the residence requirement in the student grant schemes for the 2010/11 academic year.  From the start of that academic year, the residence requirement to be met by a student in order to qualify for the maintenance grant was changed from a one-year requirement to have been living in the State directly prior to attending college, to a more flexible requirement of three out of the previous five years for the student.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">I understand that the main purpose of the change was to ensure that persons applying for grants would have more established links with and integration into the State and, in many instances that the change provides greater flexibility for students who may be returning from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The residence requirement must be met by the student himself or herself in all cases and is no longer linked to the residence of the parent or legal guardian of the student. Save where a student has been studying abroad, there are no exceptions made for particular groups — the requirement is applied equally to all.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">In addition to the increased flexibility introduced by allowing residence to be counted over the five years prior to entering college, a student may now also meet the residence requirement during the course of their studies in order to qualify for a grant. In the past, if a student did not meet the residence requirement on entry to a course, this could not be reassessed even if the requirement could subsequently be met during the course of their studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">Now, all students are treated equally with regard to meeting the residence requirement.  All students have greater flexibility in meeting the "three out of five" years requirement.  And, even students who fail to meet the "three out of five" years at initial registration can now reapply in the course of their studies once they have met the residence requirement.  I have no plans to change these arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1460">When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">Some further limited alleviation was announced in August 2011 for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.

These are currently being examined and prioritised and the schools will be advised of the outcome in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1463">As the Deputy is aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services including the approval of special classes for children with autism. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify educational placements for children with special educational needs. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">The SENO can identify the available placements for children but the enrolment is a matter for the parents and the individual schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">The condition of the country's finances mean that further difficult decisions will have to be taken by Government to reduce expenditure on public services.  All sectors, including education, are being examined as part of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review and the full range of savings options identified as part of the Review will inform the Government's decisions in the Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The options available to my Department to achieve further savings are constrained by several factors. These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1472">The specific EU/IMF commitments and targets in relation to a reduction in the overall number of public servants on the payroll including teachers.  Employees in the education sector account for close to one third of all employees in the public sector.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1473">Some 77% of the expenditure by the Department of Education and Skills comprises public sector pay and pensions. Public sector pay is protected under the terms of the Croke Park Agreement.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1474">The education sector is facing significant demographic pressures. The school going population is projected to increase by over 40,000 at primary level and by over 25,000 at post primary level over the next 6 years.  Enrolments to higher education institutions are projected to increase by over 45,000 during the same period.  There are also increased demands for further education and training places.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1475">Savings are required in the Education Vote in order to support a number of planned reforms designed to improve the educational outcomes of all students and learners, a key priority for Government.  Such reforms include the implementation of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, reform of the Junior Certificate curriculum, and the completion of the roll-out of 100 MB broadband to second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The Government is committed to protecting front line education services as far as possible and will strive to protect the most vulnerable at all levels of the education system, but we cannot underestimate the challenge ahead. The state of the country's finances mean that the education sector will have to contribute to the overall budgetary adjustment over the next four years 2012 to 2015.  The scope for achieving such savings in the education sector is constrained by the factors I have outlined above.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">The issue to which the Deputy refers relates to the change in the residence requirement in the student grant schemes for the 2010/11 academic year.  From the start of that academic year, the residence requirement to be met by a student in order to qualify for the maintenance grant was changed from a one-year requirement to have been living in the State directly prior to attending college, to a more flexible requirement of three out of the previous five years for the student.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">I understand that the main purpose of the change was to ensure that persons applying for grants would have more established links with and integration into the State and, in many instances that the change provides greater flexibility for students who may be returning from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">The residence requirement must be met by the student himself or herself in all cases and is no longer linked to the residence of the parent or legal guardian of the student. Save where a student has been studying abroad, there are no exceptions made for particular groups — the requirement is applied equally to all.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">In addition to the increased flexibility introduced by allowing residence to be counted over the five years prior to entering college, a student may now also meet the residence requirement during the course of their studies in order to qualify for a grant. In the past, if a student did not meet the residence requirement on entry to a course, this could not be reassessed even if the requirement could subsequently be met during the course of their studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">Now, all students are treated equally with regard to meeting the residence requirement.  All students have greater flexibility in meeting the "three out of five" years requirement.  And, even students who fail to meet the "three out of five" years at initial registration can now reapply in the course of their studies once they have met the residence requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">While I am not aware of any impediment to changing this arrangement, I have no plans to do so at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1487">My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.   My Department's policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  This policy continues to reflect what is in the best interest of the children concerned and I will support and build on developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 430 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism.</p>

My officials have been working very closely with Forfás, the HEA and representatives of the ICT sector to more precisely identify the shortages that are being experienced and how they might be addressed.  Specific proposals for an ICT Action Plan are being developed in consultation with industry representatives which aim to increase the domestic supply of high level ICT graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion and re skilling opportunities while also boosting the longer term supply of graduates in terms of numbers and quality. These include the provision of almost 2,000 Springboard places on ICT programmes, over 800 of which are at honours/masters degree level.  Industry and academic experts have also been working together on the design of a tender for a new one year graduate skills conversion programme to commence early in 2012.  The HEA expects to issue this tender before the end of the week.</p>

        <b> Deputy Michael Conaghan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b>
         the nature of diplomatic relations with the State of Kuwait; the diplomatic presence Ireland has in the State of Kuwait; and his plans to further diplomatic relations with this State.

            <p eId="para_1558">Diplomatic relations with the State of Kuwait are conducted through Ireland's Embassy in Abu Dhabi, which opened in October 2009.  Previously, all of Ireland's diplomatic relations with the Gulf States was conducted via the Embassy in Riyadh.   The Ambassador in Abu Dhabi presented his credentials to H.H.   Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Emir of the State of Kuwait, in April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">The opening of the new Embassy has increased the State's diplomatic representation in the region and makes it possible for Ireland to do more in Kuwait, and in other locations across the Gulf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">While there are no current plans to upgrade Ireland's representation in Kuwait, some progress has been made in a number of specific areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">In late 2010, a Double Taxation Agreement was signed between Ireland and Kuwait.  It is hoped that this can enter into force in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">In addition, Kuwait is one of the countries included in the pilot visa programme operated by the Department of Justice and Law Reform which will run until October 2012. The Programme was announced by the Government in July 2011 as part of its Jobs Initiative with a view to promoting tourism from emerging markets.  This means that Kuwaiti nationals, holding a visa for the UK, may visit Ireland from the UK for business or tourism purposes, without obtaining an Irish visa.  It is hoped that this will increase the number of visitors from Kuwait into Ireland.</p>

         if he will consider a further proposal by an organisation (details supplied) to introduce a system whereby second hand cars can be re-registered in a different county of choice, as in the case of a car originally registered in the west of Ireland whose new purchaser requires a Dublin registered plate, which cannot happen at present but the organisation believes this would be an added advantage to the second hand car market with no cost to the public finances.

            <p eId="para_1640">The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will amend the 1931 Betting Act to inter alia establish the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, including measures to enforce the regulatory framework.  The extension of the opening hours of retail betting shops over the winter period is being considered in that context.  The Finance Act 2011 contains legislation that, subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order, provides for the extension of betting duty to remote bookmakers and betting exchanges.  The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will provide for a regulatory and licensing regime, is enacted. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2011 is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">It is expected that by including this high-growth area of the betting sector, particularly given the increasing prevalence of smart phones, the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.  In a full year it is expected that the tax yield could grow up to €20 million depending on the prevailing market conditions.  Just as important is the positive signal this measure will convey to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland.  A location with an appropriate licensing framework coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1643">The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provided for a second reduced VAT rate, of 9%, on a temporary basis in respect of certain tourism-related services and goods for the period 1 July 2011 to end 2013.  Businesses must account for VAT at the 9% rate on these specified goods and services provided by them on or after 1 July 2011.  Where the goods and services are supplied to another VAT-registered business a VAT invoice must be issued, charging VAT at the new rate.  However, where the supplies are to unregistered customers there is no obligation to show the VAT separately.  Businesses dealing with unregistered customers are not legally obliged to reduce their (VAT-inclusive) pricing to reflect the lower VAT rate, but would be expected to do so.  However, in reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, the introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  With this in mind, the VAT reduction will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.  In addition, checks on the correct operation of VAT, including the rates of VAT applied are integral parts of Revenue's audit and compliance programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1645">The question of rationalisation and the reduction in the number of State bodies is being considered in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the overall budgetary and estimates process for 2012, and decisions on such matters will be made by the Government over the coming weeks.  The priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State Agencies states that rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  The overriding imperative is the absolute requirement to achieve major savings in all areas of expenditure and to reduce staff numbers and administrative overheads.  This underscores the need for radical streamlining of bodies, abolishing those bodies whose remit is no longer essential and amalgamation of other agencies or sharing of services between bodies, so that public services and functions can be delivered more cost-effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">Details in relation to bodies under the aegis on my Department are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">
              <b>National Treasury Management Agency</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1648">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) was established in 1990 with a commercial remit outside the civil service structure. It has a range of functions providing financial and risk management services to the Government.  These include borrowing for the Exchequer and management of the National Debt, the State Claims Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) and the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA).</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The NPRF, the NDFA and NAMA each have their own board.  The NTMA acts as the executive in respect of the NPRF and the NDFA.  In the case of NAMA it assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA for the cost of these staff and services from its operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">From March 2010 to August 2011 certain banking system functions of the Minister for Finance were delegated to the NTMA. The delegation of banking system functions to the NTMA was revoked with effect from 5 August 2011 and the NTMA banking team has been seconded to the Department of Finance.  The NTMA budget for 2011 (excluding NAMA for which it is reimbursed as set out above) is €44.6m.  The NTMA is located at Treasury Building, Grand Canal Street, Dublin 2. There are currently 428 employees in the NTMA.  It is not proposed to abolish or wind down any of these agencies in the context of budget 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">
              <b>National Assets Management Agency</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1652">The National Asset Management Agency is based in Treasury Building, Dublin; NAMA is funded from its own resources and the agency does not receive any voted moneys — Exchequer loans of €250m and €49m issued in 2010 have been repaid with interest; NAMA's officers are employees of the NTMA and it is expected that there will be up to 200 such officers by the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">In addition there are currently two independent bodies in existence relating to credit unions.  These are the Credit Union Advisory Committee and the Commission on Credit Unions.  The Credit Union Advisory Committee is a statutory committee, established under Section 180 of the Credit Union Act 1997, whose task is to advise the Minister for Finance on credit union matters.  The Commission on Credit Unions was established by the Government on 31 May 2011 to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relations to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1722">The restructuring of the domestic banking sector creates capacity for the pillar banks to lend in excess of €30 billion over the next three years in SME and other important sectors. This is in excess of Central Bank estimates of the likely demand for SME and mortgage credit over this period. Both pillar banks are concentrating on the Irish economy and need to issue credit to make profits and rebuild their balance sheets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">As the Deputy has mentioned, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks will be required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion this year, €3.5 billion next year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Both pillar banks have provided me with their plans to ensure that the 2011 target is achieved. This is particularly relevant given the comments contained in the fifth quarterly report of the Credit Review Office, which stated that "it will be a challenge for each of the banks to reach their €3bn sanction target for new and restructured facilities in the current year."  In this regard, my officials, along with Mr Trethowan, have quarterly meetings with the pillar banks to ensure that their lending targets are being achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">Although the level of lending to SMEs by the pillar banks in the year to date is commercially sensitive, I can advise the Deputy that both banks have informed my Department that they are on course to meet their lending targets for 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">The Credit Review Office will provide more clarity on the progress of the two banks in relation to the 2011 target when he issues his next quarterly report before the end of November.</p>

         the way the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note payment for 2012 is included in the national accounts; the impact on the primary deficit during 2012 if no such payment is made in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1730">In 2010 the previous Government issued promissory notes to a number of financial institutions, primarily Anglo Irish Bank. These promissory notes amounted to €30.85 billion — €25.3bn to Anglo Irish Bank, €5.3bn to Irish Nationwide Building Society and €250m to the Educational Building Society.  The effect of this was to increase the General Government Deficit by €30.85 billion or 20% of GDP in 2010. The reason the full amount of these promissory notes was included as part of the General Government Deficit in 2010 is because EUROSTAT rules require that the impact on the general government accounts be recorded in the year in which the obligation was recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">In terms of the cash payments which impact the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement, the promissory notes are being paid over to the financial institutions in annual tranches of 10% of the capital amount. The first tranche of €3.085bn was paid from the Exchequer earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">As the capital amount of €30.85bn has already been recorded in the General Government Debt and Deficit figures, the annual payments of €3.085bn do not impact any further on the General Government Deficit or Debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">However, taking account of the promissory note structure and the phased payment of the monies due on the note means that there is additional accrued interest associated with the notes that must also be taken account of in the General Government Deficit and Debt calculations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Taking account of the previous Government's agreement with EUROSTAT, an interest holiday for 2011 and 2012 was agreed. This means that the General Government Deficit is not impacted in 2012 by the promissory note payment, save for the very small impact of accrued interest due on the EBS note. It is currently estimated that the General Government Deficit is approximately 1% higher in 2013 as a result of the accounting treatment of the accrued interest payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">If no such cash payment was made in 2012 the Exchequer primary deficit would, all other things being equal, be €3.085bn lower. However such a non-payment for 2012 would have no effect on the general government primary deficit because the capital amount of €30.85bn was recognised in the 2010 General Government Deficit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1740">It is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax band mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of a new 48% rate would be of the order of €380 million.  However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1780">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the standard basis for any estimate of the tax yield from the action suggested by the Deputy would be the tax returns filed for the year 2009 (the latest year for which such information is available).  Assuming that the proposed levy would apply to the same taxable income of all companies to which current standard rate of corporation tax rate applies, a straight line estimate of the nominal full year yield to the Exchequer from imposing an additional tax rate of 3.5% could be of the order of €980 million.  In reality, this level of additional tax revenue will not be realised due to behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a measure which would be a significant factor given the scale of the increase suggested in the question.  Estimating the size of the behavioural effects of a change of this nature is difficult but they are significant.  An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate which is what the levy would be, in effect, reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average. In other words, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%. (This assumes the average applies across the board — but in fact it is likely to be more extreme for Ireland).  Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth.  In ranking taxes by their impact on economic growth, corporate tax was found to be most harmful.  In other words, governments seeking additional tax revenues would be advised to consider increasing all other types of tax (property, consumption and income) before increasing corporate taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The very major importance to Ireland's international competitive position of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax in the current climate must also be borne in mind. Ireland (like other smaller member states) is geographically and historically a "peripheral" country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to "core" countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1783">I wish to advise the Deputy that companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12½ per cent rate on their trading profits.  A higher 25 per cent rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and chargeable capital gains.  This rate also applies in respect of certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  The 10 per cent corporation tax rate for profits from manufacturing expired at the end of 2010 and the 12½ per cent rate now applies to such profits.  Accordingly, all companies operating here pay corporation tax at the 12 ½ per cent rate or at the higher 25 per cent rate on their taxable profits.  The ongoing yield from corporation tax reflects this position and the question of additional revenue as suggested by the Deputy does not therefore arise.  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used and it is difficult to determine a general or single reliable comparative measure of an effective tax rate.  This fact is acknowledged in the TCD Discussion Paper referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">I am not in a position to comment on the calculations that underpin the figures in the TCD study referred to by the Deputy.  However, other recent studies by international accountancy firms and the European Commission have shown that Ireland has an effective tax rate which is close to the statutory 12 ½ per cent rate.  This is only to be expected as Ireland's 12 ½ per cent corporation tax regime is transparent, does not discriminate based on company size or ownership and applies across a broad base.</p>

            <p eId="para_1786">The theory behind site value tax — or land value tax, as it is often called — is that tax is calculated by reference to the value of the land or site irrespective of whether there is a property on the site, or of what type of property is in place.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to site values.  I am not aware that any other agency has such information.  The value of land has decreased in recent times, which would affect the potential yield.  The return from a site value tax would also depend on whether the tax applied to all land or only to certain types of land, such as residential land.  It is therefore not possible for my Department to provide the information requested by the Deputy on the potential return from a site value tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">A decision has yet to be taken on what form of property tax will be introduced, whether a site value tax or some other form, the precise legal mechanism to be used to introduce the tax, and whether this will be done in tax legislation such as the Finance Bill or through other legislation which may fall within the ambit of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">The Deputy will be aware that the Government has decided to introduce a household charge at a flat rate of €100 in 2012, to meet the commitment in the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU Commission, ECB and IMF to introduce a property tax.  The household charge is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and it is expected to raise €160 million from the charge if collected in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1790">As regards the Deputy's request for projections for each quarter in 2012 and at end-2013, 2014 and 2015, quarterly Irish economic data can be very volatile and are subject to non-negligible revisions.  This was evident once again in the latest Quarterly National Accounts release, which revealed that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, real GDP grew by 1.6 per cent quarter on quarter in Q2 2011 following positive growth of 1.9 per cent in Q1 2011.  The previous estimate for the first quarter of 2011 was 1.3 per cent growth.  Given this volatility, my Department's growth forecasts are based on annual rather than quarterly figures.  This is in line with the approach of others, including the Central Bank and ESRI.  The table below sets out the information the Deputy requests, showing real annual GDP growth in each of the years 2008 to 2010.  My Department's projections for each of the years 2011 to 2015, as published in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, are set out in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_1810">The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the interest rates they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned.  Interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, and an institution's overall funding.  I have no statutory function in relation to business interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.  The Financial Regulator and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated in his response of 11 November 2011 to the Taoiseach on the issue of passing on mortgage interest rate adjustments following ECB actions, the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interest rates is not sought by the Central Bank.  Similar principles apply in relation to business interest rates.  The Deputy Governor has indicated that the Central Bank will, within its existing powers and through suasion, engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard mortgage variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">He has indicated that experience of such controls in the past and in other countries does not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning.  Binding controls tend to reduce availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit.  The Regulator indicates that this could have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors into the market.  By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would, especially during this recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">In conclusion, it is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1918">Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna  Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for  Money Review of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">One of the changes announced was the uniform application of the distance criterion of 3.2 kilometres to all pupils travelling under the primary school transport scheme.  This change, which came into effect this school year, means that the distance eligibility criterion of 3.2 kilometres is being applied uniformly and equitably on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">In line with the terms of the national primary school transport scheme, children residing less than 3.2kms may only apply for transport on a concessionary basis, subject to a number of conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">In this particular case Bus Éireann has reported that 8 children are no longer eligible for school transport as they reside less than 3.2 kilometres from the school.  These children are however availing of school transport on a concessionary basis this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">It is essential to stress that the wider context within which this and other changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.</p>

         asked the

         if he will reinstate the two teaching posts lost to a school (details supplied) in County Cork. 
        [34937/11]

          </question>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_628">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1930">The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Departments criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">As set out in my Departments Circular 0042/2011, in order for the NCSE to complete the processing of applications for mainstream schools in the first instance, the existing 2010/11 level of SNA supports have been maintained in special schools for the coming school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments, with a review to take place early in the 11/12 school year.  The school referred to by the Deputy has therefore not received a reduction in its SNA staff levels over those applying at the end of the last school year.  The review of SNA support at special schools is currently ongoing and I understand that the review of SNA provision at the school referred to by the Deputy will take place in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">In relation to teaching posts, Circular 0042/11 states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools.  The Circular indicated that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.  The special school referred to by the Deputy caters for pupils with severe/profound disability and ASD.  The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1.  In 2010/11 the school had 7 approved class teaching posts, 3 surplus teaching posts and 28 SNAs.  The enrolment is 38 pupils, including 9 new children enrolled for September 2011.  One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement.  A further surplus post has been withdrawn leaving the school with 1 surplus post above recommended staffing allocation levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">It is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that notwithstanding the outcome of any review of SNA support at the school, that the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to enable it to provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1940">The Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  In conjunction with this, I indicated that I will publish details next month of the school building projects to be constructed in 2012.  Early in the new year, I will publish a five year plan outlining the projects to be constructed in that time.  Given the constraints on capital funding, the Government has to prioritise school building projects and the very real need to ensure that every child has access to a school place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1961">This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and to the delivery of the goals and targets proposed.  As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.  The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.  Only when these steps have been implemented, the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012.  The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.</p>

The Council is composed of representatives of the teacher representative bodies, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.  The procedures for these schemes are outlined under Circular 29/2007.  As these are agreed procedures it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in any individual case.</p>

The PTR in EAG for second level is lower than the figure published by my Department (13.0) for the same year (2008/2009), due to the inclusion of pupils and teachers in other settings such as STTC, Youthreach and FAS.

            <p eId="para_2108">It is important to note that Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.  The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. The Board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.  There are presently no plans to introduce a panel system for SNAs. However, the Deputy will be aware that my Department has recently published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">The Value for Money review recommended that the Department of Education and Skills should consider conducting a cost benefit analysis, to establish if the introduction of a regional redeployment scheme for SNAs would lead to greater economic efficiency. It also recommended that alternative employment models for SNAs that could achieve greater administrative efficiencies and provide greater employment certainty for SNAs should be considered by the DES.  My Department has established a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">In the interim, a Special Needs Assistant whose post is surplus to the approved allocation to the school may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the terms of circular 58/2006 — titled Redundancy Arrangements for Special Need Assistants. Support to SNAs who may have been made redundant is provided for within the terms of this scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2120">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">There is no requirement for local school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department. My Department does receive a number of complaints and queries from parents regarding matters such as bullying involving schools. It important to highlight that in many of these instances, parents are seeking guidance from the Department on how to resolve an issue or an alleged incident within a school.  In dealing with complaints the Department's role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools' complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">My Department has issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">As a further aid to post-primary schools my Department published in 2007 a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy. The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">When a Whole School Evaluation (WSE) is conducted by my Department's Inspectorate, the code of behaviour, including its anti-bullying policy, is reviewed by the inspection team to check that it is in line with the Department's guidelines. Inspectors normally meet with the principal, the board, post-holders, year heads, class teachers, programme co-ordinators, the pastoral care team, representatives of the students and parents. During these meetings there is a particular emphasis on the quality of student care and support. The inspectors' evaluation is also informed by observations in classroom settings and throughout the school. Where there are weaknesses in a school's policy or implementation of policies clear recommendations for improvement are made and are included in the published report of the inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">Revised procedures for WSE in schools have recently been put in place. A new element of the revised WSE process involves the issuing of questionnaires directly to pupils and parents. Children and parents will be asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying, discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. This enhanced engagement with parents and pupils through questionnaires aims to further support all schools to implement effective measures to counter bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">The Deputy may also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. Since 2001, national professional development support services have provided ongoing support to schools in planning policies on child protection and the code of behaviour and in supporting teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE. In addition, training on The Stay Safe Programme is offered on an ongoing basis to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">Other measures in place include the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative, the EU Safer Internet Programme campaign and the establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) which is currently working with over 80 post-primary schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</p>

            <p eId="para_2131">Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 — over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary  — and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary.  This projected growth in enrolments reflects the increases in enrolment at both levels in the past five years and also the continuing very high level of births.  The necessity to ensure sufficient school places arising from increasing demographics and involving both new school buildings and extensions, will continue to be the priority for schools capital expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">In relation to Higher Education, the growth in student numbers is monitored on a continuous basis.  In this regard, the Higher Education Authority is examining all issues relating to the funding of higher education having regard to continuous growth and budgetary constraints.  The planned outcome of this work is to facilitate Government decisions that support realistic and  sustainable levels of growth in student numbers despite the difficult economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The Government's Medium Term Capital Investment Framework which was published last week includes an allocation for education capital of just over €2.2 bn over the five years of the plan — an average annual allocation of just over €440 m.  This investment for the next five years will provide over 100,000 permanent school places of which over 80,000 will be additional school places. This substantial investment will result in over 11% of the total school population benefiting from new permanent places delivered during the period 2012 to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">In addition, this will also enable higher education projects such as the UCD Science Library, NUI Maynooth's library project, the University of Limerick Medical school to be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2140">The Deputy will be aware that, while a qualifying student may receive a lower rate of grant for the 2011/12 academic year, they will not lose grant assistance and students whose parents are on particularly low incomes will also receive a top-up in the special rate of grant.  Students qualifying for a grant will also have their fees and/or student service charge paid on their behalf.  In addition, students in exceptional financial circumstances can apply for assistance under the Student Assistance Fund.  Information on the Fund is available through the access offices of third-level institutions.  The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</p>

            <p eId="para_2142">The number of full-time new entrants to publicly funded higher education institutions under the Higher Education Authority is larger than it has ever been due to an expansion in third level places in recent years.  Indeed, Ireland is currently performing very strongly in terms of student participation in higher education and has the highest tertiary attainment rate among 25-34 year olds in the European Union.  Most recent data available to my Department, in respect of the 2010/11 academic year, indicates that almost 41,000 full-time new entrants had entered Irish higher education institutions, bringing the total full-time enrolment to a record high of 161,000.  Enrolment in higher education in Ireland has increased by almost 16% since 2007.  The higher education sector has stretched itself significantly to accommodate these historic increases in the student population at both third and fourth level.  This has been achieved largely on the strength of more efficient utilisation of campus space in the sector.  Data on numbers of Irish students seeking college places abroad is not available to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2146">I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 to 128, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Firstly, I wish to reiterate this Government's commitment to the provision of resources for children with special educational needs.   The Programme for Government sets out that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department — some €1.3 billion — will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year.  This provision is in line with expenditure in 2010 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">This Government is committed to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs.  10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the coming school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities. This represents an increase over the December 2010 position where 10,543 posts were provided.  Unlike other areas of the public sector SNA vacancies can be filled up to the approved number.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary &amp; post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of approximately 350 whole time equivalent posts over last year's allocation.   Over 1,000 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.   Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over €60m per year.  Approximately €1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2½ years of age. There are now 56 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department.  Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 ½ years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.  An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.  Whereas it is not possible to anticipate future budgetary decisions, my Government is committed to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs.</p>

In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services including the approval of special classes for children with special needs. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.

            <p eId="para_2314">The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally-assessed needs of each individual child. My Departments policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many students with special educational needs will therefore not require or seek a special class placement, but will be educated along with their peers in mainstream provision, with additional supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education  (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers  (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post  primary schools for special educational needs supports.

However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country.

The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_2326">The priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State Agencies states that rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, democratically  accountable and efficient public service.  This underscores the need for radical streamlining of bodies, abolishing those bodies whose remit is no longer essential and amalgamation of other agencies or sharing of services between bodies.  All State agencies will be subject to critical evaluation in this overall context and the outcome of the Government's deliberations will be published in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2399">The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published by the Government on 4 November detailed the budgetary parameters for the next four years including the revised current and capital envelopes. The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement also set out and discussed the economic and fiscal projections for the period ahead that are consistent with those budgetary parameters. As regards employment, the economy is expected to be creating jobs on a net basis by the end of next year, with the pace of hiring forecast to strengthen in subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">In considering the Capital envelope and the Government's detailed Capital Review that I published last week, it is first necessary to realise that most of the economy's key infrastructural deficits have been addressed through a massive capital investment of about €70bn over the last decade. The Budgetary situation requires spending to be prioritised and the Public Capital Programme to be scaled back.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">The Review made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years and in 2012 delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. While the overall capital envelope for 2012 has been reduced, we have actually held the level of capital allocation for the enterprise sector relative to the preceding period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">The State will be spending some €17 billion over the next five years on activities throughout the country and this will help support employment in many key areas. It is important to note that less expensive re-fit, refurbishment, and up-grade works can be more labour-intensive than larger capital-intensive projects that have been deferred.</p>

Sanction was given for 3 Inspectors (mainstream policing) and 1 Inspector mapping and 4 Sergeants (fingerprinting (3) and Ballistics (1). 3 of the Inspector posts (mainstream policing) were refused on the grounds that the posts would have to be accommodated through re-organisation/rebalancing of workload of existing postholders. The Inspector posts were filled to replace key staff who are due to retire.  The specialist posts were filled due to the need for specialist services. The IT and Telecoms posts are still under consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_8882">I presume that the  Deputy is referring to the Public Capital Programme as the NDP has effectively been superseded for some time now.   In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Capital Review which the Government published last week. This lays out allocations and priorities for capital investment from 2012 to 2016 reflecting the fiscal constraints we are experiencing.  I understand copies of the Review have been circulated to Deputies.<b/>

As both bodies were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation. The proposed Bill will also:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8953">update the existing competition law on foot a review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Competition Act,</p>

In relation to the Employment Rights and Industrial Relations bodies within my Department's remit,   I have announced my intention to streamline the work of five bodies currently dealing with employment disputes in the workplace into a two-tier structure. Four of the existing bodies — the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court — are currently within my remit. One — the Equality Tribunal — is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I expect this reform and streamlining project to deliver a measurable improvement in the quality of services provided to users of the State's employment rights/industrial relations dispute resolution services and reduce the burden of accessing such services for users and reduce costs to the State. I have announced an ambitious timeline for delivery, including a number of initiatives to be delivered by the end of this year, including a single portal of entry for all claims, a single website containing all relevant information and a single application form for workplace dispute claims. Regarding the Enterprise agencies under my Department's remit, I am currently considering how the policy and research functions of Forfás could be integrated with my Department's resources to further enhance the formulation and development of national enterprise policy.</p>

The Central Bank has agreed to collect the levy on the Agency's behalf for administrative reasons. In the interim, the Department is paying non-pay costs through Subhead R02 and the Central Bank is funding pay costs. The Department will be reimbursed when the levy is collected by the Central Bank later on in the year. The Central Bank administers the pay costs in relation to this function on behalf of the Agency. An allocation of €2m is included in the Estimates figure provided for the Agency and the staffing figure includes 18.9 whole-time equivalent staff in respect of these functions.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_8979">Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI) is a key pillar of support for dynamic new industries and investments through the Fund facilitate job creation in innovative export focused sectors as well as providing a return to the exchequer over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_8980">The Fund has up to €250 million available to make commitments. This funding runs along two parallel tracks. The first comprises a €125 million pool of funds provided by the Exchequer and managed by Enterprise Ireland. Successful applicants who receive an investment from Enterprise Ireland will have to commit to investing an equivalent amount in ‘Irish companies or companies with significant Irish operations' over the lifetime of their fund. The second is for a similar amount and designed to allow Ireland's National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) to make a similar level of commercial investments assuming its criteria are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_8981">Over the lifetime of the funds, it is envisaged that the State will make a return on its investment. In terms of economic growth where the Funds invest in Irish start-up, scaling companies or companies with operations in Ireland, the State can expect to see:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8982">an increase in employment;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8983">an increase in the number of high potential start-ups;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8984">the attraction of high potential start up and scaling European technology and life science companies requiring growth capital investment to Ireland;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8985">increased commercialisation of the ideas and R&amp;D coming out of the Universities and Institutes of Technology and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8986">the enhancement of Ireland as a centre for technology, life sciences and venture capital investment within Europe through multiple fund iterations.</p>
            <p eId="para_8987">Following the first call for expressions of interest in September 2010, a large number of responses were received from a sectorally and geographically diverse group of companies.  To date the NPRF have made three investments. The first investments were in DJF Esprit and DFJ Venture Capital resulting in a partner being hired on the ground in Ireland to invest in Irish companies. The other NPRF investment is in Polaris which has resulted in the establishment of the first Dogpatch Incubator Lab outside of the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_8988">The first round of commitments out of the €125m of Enterprise Ireland managed funds are expected to be to be formalised in the near term that will amount to €60m of the total EI fund.  As you will be aware I issued a statement on October 5th indicating my intention to issue a second call for expressions of interest for the remaining of the fund when the first of the new Irish offices associated with these new investments is established.</p>
            <p eId="para_8989">Venture Capital Funds are established by way of Limited Partnership Agreements. These involve limited partners such as Enterprise Ireland committing to invest an agreed figure over the lifetime of a venture capital fund.  Venture Capital Funds are normally 10 years in length and during the first 5 years (known as the investment period) the Fund managers make investments in new companies and in the latter stages of the fund they follow those investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_8990">The exact drawdown per year for commitments under IFI to 2016 will depend on a range of factors which will only become clear when the expressions of interest are received and examined following a second call.  Therefore, the annual spend over the period is dependent on the investments made of the fund and cannot be predetermined.  However, in estimating this for budget purposes, previous Enterprise Ireland drawn down figures and international benchmarks have been used and these have been factored into the EI capital allocation announced by me last week.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that FÁS recently removed funding to community employment schemes (details supplied); the impact this withdrawal will have on after schools education and support programmes; if she will review this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_9070">From 1st January 2011 policy and funding responsibility for FÁS functions in relation to employment and community employment services was transferred to the Department of Social Protection in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010.  FÁS remains responsible for the day to day operation of community employment in accordance with the terms of a Service Agreement/Framework Document which it has concluded with the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9071">A number of community employment projects operate in support of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 to provide 1,000 work and training placements as part of the overall funding for the community employment programme.  These work and training placements can be located in special CE projects or in designated CE positions in other CE projects as in the case with the organisation detailed.  Specific criteria for the selection of placements and participants agreed with the sector representatives are in place.  Further work is underway by the National Drug Rehabilitation Implementation Committee under the aegis of the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy to review the allocation of placements and recruitment procedures to ensure that effective referral protocols are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_9072">FÁS has informed me that there has been no withdrawal or reduction in funding to the organisation detailed by the Deputy.  As indicated during a Topical Issues Debate on this matter in this House on Tuesday the 8th   November last, the conditions relating to the CE Drugs Rehabilitation Programme have not changed.  The position is that, following a review process carried out by the CE Oversight Working Group during 2010, the conditions have been restated and the referral process has been clarified.  A commitment has been given to the organisation concerned that those participants already engaged by it under the CE Drugs Rehabilitation Programme will not be detrimentally affected by the refocusing of recruitment procedures.  Participant numbers supported by FÁS in the organisation will be maintained at their present level.  My Department will continue to work with the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy and with FÁS to improve the effectiveness of this particular initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_9124">Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.  Part-time firefighters are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in firefighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  In this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat them differently to any other jobseeker's benefit or allowance claimant.  While the importance of retained fire brigade personnel is fully recognised, special arrangements exempting them from the requirement to fulfil the statutory conditions for entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or allowance would raise equity issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> other claimants to jobseeker’s payments.  However, taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise our jobseeker schemes, a group has been established in the Department to examine the position of part-time firefighters in relation to unemployment payments.  The issues involved in this area are detailed and considerations by the group are ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_9126">The three statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board.  In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman (which does not have a board) comes under the remit of the Department.  Mr. Eugene McErlean was appointed to the Citizens Information Board on 7 September 2011.  That vacancy was publicly advertised and the appointment was made following a rigorous selection process taking account of the need for particular expertise on the board.  Following a recent resignation, there is one vacancy on the Social Welfare Tribunal to be filled by a nominating body.  The process for appointing a replacement member is under way.  No appointment has been made to the board of the Pensions Board since 9 March 2011.  Information on boards, board members and appointments is available on the Department's website at <i>www.welfare.ie/EN/AboutUs/Pages/stateagencies.aspx</i> and is updated as required.</p>

            <p eId="para_9128">The community services programme co-funds the services delivered by around 440 community-based not-for-profit enterprises across the State.  Some €47.4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2011, supporting 2,800 people in full-time and part-time employment.  A key requirement of the programme is that the service provider must generate a significant element of their turnover from traded activity or other non-public sources of income.  The reduction in the rate of employers' PRSI resulting from the Government's jobs initiative will have a positive effect on some service providers funded by the community services programme by reducing their PRSI liability.  I do not propose to alter the value of the contracts in place with service providers for 2011.</p>

The information shown in respect of 2011 is the Estimate published in the Revised Estimates Volume.  From its inception, social insurance spending was funded on a tripartite basis, with contributions coming from employers, workers and the Exchequer.  The Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund and Exchequer contributions were the norm over 40 years.  For example in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of fund expenditure and almost 29% in 1985.  However, no Exchequer contributions were required between 1996 and 2009 as the Fund was in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers.  The Social Insurance Fund has incurred an operating deficit each year since 2008.  Total spending in 2008 exceeded total income in 2008 and that pattern has been repeated in subsequent years.  This deficit was funded in 2008 and 2009 using the fund's cash reserves accumulated in the earlier years of operating surplus.  The remaining balance of the accumulated surplus was fully depleted during 2010, with the shortfall in 2010 and again in 2011 being met by way of Exchequer subvention from Vote 38 in accordance with section 9 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_9539">The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 requires regular actuarial reviews of the financial condition of the Social Insurance Fund.  The last such review was published in 2007 and was based on the position as at 31 December 2005.  The key objectives of the review were to project future contribution income to and benefit outgo fro the Fund.  The review also considers the adequacy or otherwise of the current contribution rates to the Fund, the impact of a number of possible changes to the Fund's benefit / contribution terms, and the value-for-money provided by the Fund in a range of individual circumstances.  The next actuarial review will be published in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_9540">Measures such as those referred to by the Deputy are considered against this background and in the context of Budget deliberations.  It is not possible to quantify potential yield in the absence of specific proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_9617">My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine administer the arrangements that regulate sheep grazing in the Owenduff/Nephin Complex SPA and cSAC.  These arrangements have been in place for the past five years and terminated on the 31st October 2011.  Farmers in commonages which have not recovered sufficiently to meet cross-compliance standards were notified in writing of the continuation of restrictions for a further two years (until November 2013) but at reduced levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_9618">I am advised that parts of the Owenduff/Nephin commonages are showing satisfactory recovery but approximately half of the SPA has not recovered to a sufficient extent to meet the judgment of the European Court of Justice in relation to overgrazing in this SPA.  In 19 of the 40 townlands where restrictions previously existed the restrictions have been removed; in 14 of the townlands there is an ongoing but reduced restriction; and in 7 of the 40 townlands there is an ongoing but reduced restriction in parts of the commonages.</p>
            <p eId="para_9619">This new proposal will mean an increase in the numbers of sheep that can be carried on the commonages for the next two years, within sustainable parameters.   This proposal also removes the capping of sheep numbers at farm level.  Farmers can now increase their flock numbers on the in-bye land, provided that Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition standards are adhered to and commonage limits are not exceeded.</p>
            <p eId="para_9620">Compensation for losses in income, where restrictions still apply, will be paid through the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme and through top-ups to REPS and AEOS.  These payments will be funded entirely from the national exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_9621">In summary, partial restrictions will continue for two years to deliver vegetative recovery in these commonages and to ensure that all farmers are compliant with cross-compliance and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition standards.  The issue of financial assistance is being examined in the light of Departmental budgets.</p>

Other responses point to the possible significant savings for householders and the potential for improved environmental outcomes if franchise bidding were to be introduced.

The number of those on the list for longer than 4 years increased by 134% in the three years, compared with an increase of 75% in the list as a whole.  There are likely to be many contributory factors to the increase and these may vary from one authority to another.

        [34994/11]

          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_710">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_9957">As of 14 November, 2011, there were a total of 4,257 prisoners in custody and 799 on temporary release.  The number on temporary release equates to 15% of the total prisoner population.</p>
            <p eId="para_9958">There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years, with dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences.  The problem of prison overcrowding therefore remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_9959">I share the view of the Thornton Hall Review Group that decisive action is required on a number of fronts in order to address the problem of overcrowding and poor physical conditions particularly in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons.  Whilst the reduced capital envelope this year will not allow the Prison Service to proceed with the construction of Thornton Hall or Kilworth prisons, this does not signal a reversal of the Government's decision earlier this year to approve in principle the recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall Review Group Report.  It has been necessary to defer the commencement of these projects but the Deputy can be assured that it is my strong intention to revisit the timeframe for their delivery in 12 months time.</p>
            <p eId="para_9960">In the meantime, despite a reduction in the capital allocation available to the Prison Service in 2012, work will continue on the completion of a new 300 space prison wing in the Midlands Prison and it is expected that these spaces will be fully commissioned by mid 2012.  The Prison Service will also continue with the refurbishment and in-cell sanitation project in Mountjoy Prison.  The upgrade of the C Division of the prison is close to completion and will radically improve the existing physical conditions, including the provision of in-cell sanitation and the upgrading of fire safety and detection systems. In 2012, the Irish Prison Service plans to undertake a similar renovation of the B Division in the prison.  This will result in 317 cells in Mountjoy prison having in-cell sanitation by the end of that year, almost 60% of the total prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_9961">I am also continuing to pursue alternatives to custody and progress is being made.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_9962">A number of key recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall Review Group Report are also receiving priority attention in my Department and many are in the process of being implemented most notably the introduction of an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In this regard, a six month pilot project commenced in October 2011 in which it is envisaged that a total of 130 prisoners will participate.  To date, 16 prisoners have been released under the scheme with a further 14 due for release this week.  I also intend to give new guidelines to the Parole Board for the application of a similar scheme to long-term prisoners.  I expect to make further announcements about the implementation of these reforms later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9963">The Fines Act 2010 introduced measures to prevent the automatic imprisonment of fine defaulters.  I intend to bring forward new legislative proposals to introduce a system of "attachment orders" allowing a small amount of money to be taken from wages or social welfare facilitating the payment of the debt or fine over time.   The concept of restorative justice also has a place in the range of non-custodial options which are available for use by the courts.  The Deputy can be assured that my focus is to encourage the use of such options to the greatest extent possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_9966">A refurbishment project in the C-wing at Mountjoy Prison is nearing completion and will result in all cells on that wing having in-cell sanitation.  Depending on the findings of a post project appraisal, the Irish Prison Service will consider installing in-cell sanitation facilities in the remaining cells in Mountjoy and indeed to other facilities that do not have in-cell sanitation.  I am committed to ending the practice of slopping out within the prison system, however, any project to provide in-cell sanitation to the remaining wings in Mountjoy or indeed in any other facility will, of course, be subject to the availability of financial resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_9969">In this regard, a number of projects are currently under way which will improve the facilities available.  A significant programme of works is nearing completion in the Dóchas Centre where, in addition to improving the overall standard of the Centre, will provide for additional training workshops and a new training kitchen.   At the Midlands prison, as part of the new accommodation block to be fully commissioned in 2012, additional work training and educational facilities are being provided.   It will also include a new fully fitted kitchen which will provide enhanced training opportunities for prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_9984">The capital allocation to the Justice sector for 2012 is €56 million.

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_10005">I wish to inform the Deputy that it is not possible to forecast how many prisoners will benefit from temporary release in each of the next two years.  I can, however, advise that on Monday, 14 November 2011, 799 prisoners were on temporary release.  The number on temporary release equates to 15% of the total prison population.</p>
            <p eId="para_10006">The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that sentenced prisoners may be approved temporary release.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_10007">Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  The Irish Prison Service has also judiciously used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of serious overcrowding.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_10008">I might mention that a number of key recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall Review Group Report are receiving priority attention in my Department and many are in the process of being implemented most notably the introduction of an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In this regard, a six month pilot project commenced in October 2011 in which it is envisaged that a total of 130 prisoners will participate.  To date, 16 prisoners have been released under the scheme with a further 14 due for release this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_10009">I also intend to give new guidelines to the Parole Board for the application of a similar scheme to long-term prisoners.  I expect to make further announcements about the implementation of these reforms later in the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_10011">In April 2011 I established the Thornton Hall Review Group.  They reported to me in July 2011 and one of their recommendations was the establishment of an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy which would incorporate an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation, the issue of female prisoners and 16 and 17 year olds within the system.

The Order of 8 June 2011 establishing the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality gives it the power to appoint such sub-Committees who can invite submissions and draft recommendations for legislative change.</p>

            <p eId="para_10017">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_10018">RIA no longer operates an accommodation centre in County Wexford and therefore cannot facilitate the return of the person cited in this question to that county. The person had been accommodated in the Old Rectory asylum accommodation centre, New Ross, County Wexford, which was under contract to RIA to provide direct provision accommodation services to asylum seekers from 19 February, 2001 to its closure on 25 October, 2011. Residents of the centre were relocated to alternative accommodation centres, including in Cork city.</p>
            <p eId="para_10019">This closure has taken place in the context of the reducing numbers of new applications for asylum over the last number of years.  In line with this, the number of asylum seekers availing of direct provision accommodation has also decreased. The RIA is required to manage its accommodation portfolio to reflect this change in demand and accordingly has reduced contracted capacity through accommodation centre closures as follows: in 2008, five centres were closed; in 2009, six centres were closed; in 2010, eight centres were closed; and, to date in 2011, seven centres have been closed, including the Old Rectory centre.</p>

Visa applications for Kuwaiti nationals are handled by the Irish Visa Office, Abu Dhabi.  That office is an office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (I.N.I.S.) and it handles all aspects of visa applications inclusive of appeals.  In general ‘visit' visa applications for Kuwaiti nationals are considered within one — five working days of receipt.  This time frame is dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding.  Applicants are advised to lodge their applications two — three weeks in advance of the proposed date of travel.

Queries are being dealt with in the HSE Regional Adoption Department in order that enquirers can be offered a meeting with a social worker/counsellor to deal with requests as promptly as possible.

            <p eId="para_10207">The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department supports the delivery of a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_10208">St. John Bosco Youth Centre is currently in receipt of funding under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2) and the 2011 allocation to the Centre is €248,247.  Funding is administered to the Youth Centre by City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB).  In determining allocations to initiatives and schemes in 2011 my Department has made every effort to minimise the impact of the reduction in the Youth Affairs budget on front line youth work services.  In light of continuing budgetary constraints, the Youth Affairs budget in 2012 will again require careful management with a focus on prioritising existing youth service provision and protecting jobs and pay in so far as is possible.  Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies, in this instance, CDYSB, of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_10209">The main objectives of the Youth Affairs area are to develop and implement coherent, co-ordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.  To support this work, the Youth Affairs area of my Department has a budget in 2011 of €60.154m on current expenditure and €0.8m on capital expenditure.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing.  Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people.  The overall aim will be to clarify and enhance coherence, connectivity, coordination and delivery in youth services and related out-of-schools services for young people and to ensure such provision is both quality and outcomes based.  Ensuring quality service delivery is an ongoing priority for me.  My Department is at present progressing two quality standards initiatives in the youth area that will help ensure an improvement in good practice, that services are outcomes focussed and that the young people involved are deriving the maximum benefit from being involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_10213">The Adoption Act, 2010, commenced on 1st November 2010.  This coincided with Ireland's formal ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption.  The regulatory framework governing adoption has been strengthened in an attempt to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at every step throughout the adoption process.  With effect from 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_10214">The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010.  The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.  It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_10215">As provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act, 2010, the Authority may establish administrative arrangements concerning the processing of applications with other Hague countries in relation to intercountry adoptions.  The Authority has already travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities; advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries.  The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and get up to date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries.  AAI delegations will shortly travel to Mexico and the United States to discuss possible administrative agreements.  It is envisaged that the AAI will visit Vietnam in the near future as that country has recently ratified the Hague Convention and entry into force of the Convention is 1 February 2012.  The Authority has also commenced a review of the adoption laws of Lithuania, Panama, Kenya and Kazakhstan as prospective countries for adoption into Ireland, and said it would look at other Hague countries as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_10216">As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption, the Adoption Authority have indicated that their first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with non-contracting states is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State".  Ethiopia, as it is not a signatory of Hague, is covered by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010. Ireland currently has no bilateral agreements with non Hague Countries.</p>

The primary aim of the programme of agency rationalisation within the health sector is to streamline service delivery, professional registration and policy making in a number of areas, through the integration and/or amalgamation of functions.

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_10313">The Deputy refers to an application, from the person whose details are supplied, to have his professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC for the purposes of seeking employment in the publicly-funded health service in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_10314">This Directive applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_10315">For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the publicly-funded health sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_10316">Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health and Children is the Competent Authority for the profession in question.  For this profession, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.  The Period of Adaptation is defined in the Directive as: <i>“the pursuit of a regulated profession in the host Member State under the responsibility of a qualified member of that profession, such period of supervised practice possibly being accompanied by further training. This period of supervised practice shall be the subject of an assessment.”</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_10317">It would be inappropriate to comment on individual applications but I am advised that, in the case of this person's application, he has been advised of his deficit, which is in clinical research.  This deficit must be addressed by either of the compensation measures provided for in the Directive.  As the role of the recognition process is not to conduct primary assessment/evaluation of professional training but rather to assess for equivalence to Irish reference standards the certification of previous professional training, the applicant was recommended to undertake a taught research programme.  It is considered that this would satisfy the requirements of the Directive as he would receive additional professional training within a supervised structure; and the outcome of this additional training could be assessed for equivalence.</p>

            <p eId="para_10322">I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 240 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10323">Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, it is the general practitioners (GPs) contracted responsibility to provide proper and necessary treatment to medical card and GP visit card holders.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) diagnose a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services under the Health Act, 1970, as amended.  The HSE points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples.  The HSE significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.</p>
            <p eId="para_10324">At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in this regard.  I would encourage patients to follow up with the HSE if they believe they are being wrongly charged for services by their GP and the matter will be fully investigated by the HSE.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.  In a number of cases to-date, the GP has reimbursed their patients following receipt of correspondence from the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_10325">I appreciate that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients for blood tests, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p>

            <p eId="para_10329">The Public Service Agreement is an essential "enabler" for the health sector, to allow services to respond the healthcare needs of the population in an appropriate and sustainable manner, against a backdrop of very significant reductions in financial and staff resources.  The Agreement also facilitates the implementation of major reforms aimed at improving access to services, as well as improving quality and safety, achieving better value for money and improving health outcomes at a population level.</p>
            <p eId="para_10330">The introduction of revised working patterns, such as an extended working day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and new rostering arrangements, has potential significantly to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of health service delivery.  Agreement was reached in February 2011 with the relevant staff unions (MLSA, IMPACT and SIPTU) on the introduction of an extended working day for medical laboratory staff.  This affects some 3,000 staff, who now have a liability to be rostered between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  The HSE has projected annual savings of at least €5m arising from this agreement.  Discussions are at present underway in relation to revision of work patterns for radiography staff and the HSE has also tabled proposals for more flexible rostering arrangements for nursing staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_10331">To date, the HSE has submitted two detailed progress reports on the implementation of the Health Sector Action Plan under the Public Service Agreement to the national-level Implementation Body.  These refer to the periods March 2010-March 2011 and April 2011-September 2011 respectively.  Sectoral progress reports are published on the Implementation Body's website <i>www.implementationbody.gov.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_10332">Significant achievements reported to date include the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection, the centralisation of medical card processing (with estimated annual savings of €20m), implementation in late 2010 of a voluntary early retirement scheme and voluntary redundancy scheme for certain staff categories, under which 1,626 WTE staff left the public health service, and internal redeployment of a further 750 staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_10333">There must remain a clear focus on the part of all parties to the Agreement on achieving the changes and in particular the efficiencies which the PSA makes possible.  The HSE will continue to pursue further initiatives with the staff side to ensure that all possible benefits from the Agreement are achieved.</p>

         the Health Service Executive intends monitoring quicker discharge of patients, particularly at weekends by hospital consultants; the other changes to consultants’ work practices envisaged under the Croke Park agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_10335">Immediately following my appointment I set about establishing the Special Delivery Unit to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU was established in June and quickly began work with the HSE to put in place a systematic approach to eliminate excessive waiting in emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_10336">The problems in our emergency departments are complex and they did not arise overnight.  The particular issues vary from hospital to hospital and some of the solutions will depend on local factors.  However it is clear that in many cases delayed discharge is a major factor.  More rapid discharge depends on a number of factors but regular and timely ward rounds by consultants is critical, including at weekends.  As part of the work the SDU is doing in supporting the HSE this issue is being closely monitored particularly on those sites which have a particular problem with trolley waits.</p>
            <p eId="para_10337">With regard to changes to consultants work practices, an immediate priority is to achieve more effective implementation of Consultant Contract 2008.  I believe there is plenty of scope under the 2008 Contract, that provides for an extended working day, an increase in the length of the working week and structured weekend work, with consultants working as part of a team delivering the Clinical Directorate Service Plan, and the Croke Park agreement to achieve greater productivity from consultants.  For example, increased consultant participation in patient discharges at weekends would more quickly free up beds for emergency admissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_10598">Arising from the St Andrew's Agreement, the Irish Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland to Derry thus improving access to Letterkenny and North Donegal. In light of the current economic circumstances, the Government has had to defer its funding commitment to this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_10599">As indicated in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012 to 2016, given the tight fiscal constraints, roads investment will be focused on maintaining existing roads, rather than developing new routes. It is therefore not anticipated that significant resources will be available for this project over that timeframe.  Next year, a payment of £3 million is due in accordance with the current A5 payment schedule, and provision for this has been made in my Department's 2012 capital allocation. After next year, the funding requirements for the A5 will be met from the Government's unallocated reserves and not from the vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. This obviously includes the €25m contribution to the project in 2015 and 2016. As such, there will be no specific funding provision for the A5 in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's annual allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_10600">The Government will be discussing with the Northern Ireland Executive, at next Friday's North-South Ministerial Council, the extent to which it may be able to provide such funding in future years , and, in that light,  the approach to be taken to developing a new funding and implementation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_10601">Furthermore, I would remind the Deputy that the previous Government made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post 2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.</p>

         if he will consider introducing colour coded signs indicating the days and times in which bus lanes are available for cars and traffic to allow drivers to be more aware of when they may avail of bus lanes for example, green for the more normal times of 7.00 — 19.00 hours, orange for non-standard times of say 7.00 — 10.00 and 12.00 — 19.00 hours and so on, red for 24 hour bus lanes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_10603">The signage at the entrance to all bus lanes clearly indicates the times and days at which they are restricted to buses and public service vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_10604">I am advised that there have been suggestions previously regarding the format of supplementary plates associated with bus lane signs, including the use of coloured plates to indicate the times of operation. The issue was examined during the revision of the Traffic Signs Manual, which was reissued in 2010,  and it was decided on balance to keep to the existing system.  Guidance on supplementary plates is given in section 5.22 of the Traffic Signs Manual, which may be downloaded from my Department's website. <i>www.dttas.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_10609">Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) on December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as the development of the Maynooth line, comes under the remit of the NTA.  As such, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_10610">However, I would say that the electrification of the Maynooth train service is an element of the DART Underground Programme.  Due to funding constraints the DART Underground tunnel has been postponed and will be reviewed in advance of the next capital programme in 2015.   While elements of the overall programme which by themselves would bring benefits for rail commuters may precede if funds allow, this would be a matter for the NTA to determine in preparing their programme for the next 5 years arising from the funding and priorities outlined in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012-2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_10617">I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 to 263, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10618">I am informed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) that they provided  €4.9 million to the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) between 1st March 2011 and 31st October 2011 in respect of costs associated with Metro North.  The NTA provided €4.6 million to Iarnrod Éireann in respect of costs associated with DART Underground in the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_10619">With regard to the question of compensation arising from the deferment of Metro North, the terms of the Metro North PPP Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) provide for RPA to make an ex-gratia payment of up to €1 million to each tenderer remaining in the process (of which there are two) in the event that the project does not proceed. Any claim must be independently verified. This arrangement was approved by the previous Government in 2008.  Funding in respect of any reimbursement will be provided by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_10620">I would point out that there will be further costs associated with the orderly deferral of these projects. In the case of Metro North, the main item will be the works at the Mater Hospital which are required to be undertaken in order to preserve, ahead of the completion of the new Adult Hospital, the necessary clearance envelope for the subsequent construction of the underground metro stop whenever it is decided to proceed with this project in the future. I believe it is important to carry out these works so that the Metro can be built at some point in the future without the requirement to close the Adult Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_10621">I expect to have full details of all outstanding costs for these two projects by year-end.</p>
