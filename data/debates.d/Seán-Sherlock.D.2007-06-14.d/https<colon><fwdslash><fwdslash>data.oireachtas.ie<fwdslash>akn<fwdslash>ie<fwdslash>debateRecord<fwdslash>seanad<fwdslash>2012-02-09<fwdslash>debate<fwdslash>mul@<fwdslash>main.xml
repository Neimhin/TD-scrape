          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Averil Power that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify whether it is the Government's intention to change Ireland's laws regarding prostitution to bring them into line with the Swedish approach, as advocated by the Turn Off The Red Light coalition.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to outline the need for balanced regional development and the Government and enterprise agencies to ensure the recently published Forfás jobs plan delivers for the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to make a statement on the way in which he intends to address the concerns expressed by the new president of the American Chamber of Commerce regarding the fall of six of our seven universities in <i>The Times</i> higher education world university rankings.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna soiléiriú maidir leis an maoiniú atá gearrtha do na hábhair oidí sna coláistí oiliúna chun tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht mar chuid dá gcúrsa oiliúna agus an leanfaidh an riachtanas seo ar aghaidh mar chuid den cháilíocht bunmhúinteoireachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Michael Mullins of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure there is no departmental interference with the independent Agricultural Appeals Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.   I have selected the matters raised by Senators Power, Cullinane, Walsh and Ó Clochartaigh and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Mullins may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</p>

          <from>Senator Maurice Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_12">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the progress on the implementation of the Croke Park agreement, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.15 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed six minutes and the contribution of a Sinn Féin Senator not to exceed two minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed one minute when asking questions of the Minister; and No. 2, statements on the immigrant investor programme and start-up entrepreneur scheme, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 2.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed six minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed three minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply to the debate not later than 2.25 p.m.  As a number of Senators have sought a debate on the proposed scheme, I hope there will be a good attendance to hear what the Minister has to say and many contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The group leaders met yesterday and it was agreed to act on the proposal of Senator Darragh O'Brien to have a structured debate on the fiscal compact.  It is hoped that the Oireachtas Library and Research Service will be able to make a presentation to Members in advance to allow for an informed debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Creighton, will be present next Thursday to reply to the questions posed by Members in the debate on Tuesday last, in which debate she did not have an opportunity to reply.  That is in response to what the leaders requested yesterday.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I thank the Leader for the meeting yesterday.  There was a very good meeting of group leaders on having a structured debate on the fiscal compact.  It is very welcome.  The initiative involving a briefing from the Oireachtas Library will help to inform the House and the public debate.  I thank the Leader very much for this and for allowing for the return of the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House next week to answer the questions asked of her.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I support what the Leader said yesterday on the Order of Business.  From my perspective as Leader of the Opposition, the Order of Business serves a very important function in this House.  If Senators raise issues on the Order of Business, they should, at the very least, remain to receive an answer.  I support the Leader's initiative in that regard wholeheartedly.  It allows for more efficiency in the Seanad Chamber.  The Leader will have as much co-operation as possible from the Fianna Fáil side.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Today is a very important anniversary in that it is the first anniversary of the comment by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, that "not another red cent" would be paid to the banks until senior bondholders were forced to share the burden.  I found a very interesting item on the Fine Gael website, a very good and informative website, in which the party engages in some historical revisionism on this point.  Strangely, just in advance of this very important anniversary, this pillar of Fine Gael's election campaign, the item about burning the bondholders, which featured a video and an interview with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has been removed from the website.</p>

          <from>Senator Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I raise this issue because the Taoiseach has reiterated yet again, in advance of the very important summit in New York today, at which I wish him, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, well, that we will not seek debt write-down of any part of our banking debt.  I remind Senators this is completely contrary to what was said prior to the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">In being so forthright on this matter, the Taoiseach has played his hand far too early with regard to Europe.  There is no question in my mind.  The Taoiseach will go to New York today and I wish him well at this very important economic forum.  I remind him to be careful in the comments he makes today.  The last time he was at a large economic forum, in Davos, things ran on and he said certain things he did not mean.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">It is very important we highlight that in regard to debt write-down, the Government has stated very clearly it will pay all debts.  Given that this statement made in advance of the completion of our negotiations, and that in this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, stated that debt write-down was central to the negotiations on fiscal compact, what is the situation?  Is the Taoiseach correct in stating we did not seek a write-down, or is the Minister of State correct in claiming that we did?  Perhaps the Leader can let us know the true position.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I support Senator O'Brien's comments in regard to the meeting with the group leaders yesterday and like him, I commend the Leader on this.  It is a very useful initiative to have, effectively, a full day debate in March on the fiscal compact.  I am pleased, too, that the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will be in the House next Thursday to continue the debate of this week.  As I stated yesterday, however, this issue is one that changes by the day.  By the time March comes round no doubt there will be much more to say on the fiscal compact.  Given how quickly the negotiations on Greece are changing, where we see new issues raised today in that country's negotiations that we all hope will conclude and be resolved, I would essay that we will probably need a rolling debate.  To have a one-day debate is probably not enough; we will need to have further debates, not only on the fiscal compact but on EU level negotiations and the future of the eurozone.  This is very much an ongoing issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I support what was said about the Order of Business.  It is very important that Senators remain for the Leader's response.  That is a courtesy and as leaders we must all support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Yesterday some colleagues called for a debate on NAMA and the amount paid to legal firms by that body.  I raised this matter some weeks ago in terms of procurement of legal and accountancy services and it is one on which we could usefully have a debate.  There has been a tendency always to go for the larger firms of solicitors and accountants.  We see the same with credit union receiverships.  It would be worth looking at smaller firms and spreading the work more widely.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Will the Leader allow for a debate in six months' time, when we will have the report from the expert working group set up by the Government to look into how best to implement the ABC judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in December 2010?  It is timely to call for that debate now because this week marks the 20th anniversary of the X case, when, in February 1992, the then Attorney General sought and obtained an injunction to prevent a 14 year old girl from leaving the country.  We all know the outrage that was caused by the granting of the injunction and the change in law it brought about.  However, that was 20 years ago and it is long overdue that we should legislate to implement the criteria by which the X case test should be observed and implemented.  I ask the Leader that when the group reports in June the House would have a debate on that report.</p>

          <from>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I, too, welcome the clarification on the Order of Business procedures, as a relatively new Senator who, unlike Senator O'Brien, will not be joining Fine Gael or reading its website.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I have a small point that may concern the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This may be the showbiz director in me.  There is a rule that Members should not walk into the Chamber while a person is speaking, in other words, when a camera is pointed at the speaker, for example if somebody were to walk behind me or another Senator while we were speaking.  That is something we should bear in mind in terms of procedure.  I looked up the rules.  This would give a cleaner and more efficient image and would also give more respect to the Chamber, particularly as we are broadcasting.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Without pre-empting the passage through the House of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, a very important Bill in regard to donations and gender quotas, no matter which way it goes, will the Leader say whether it is possible that the final passage of that Bill might coincide with International Women's Day on March 8?  I do not wish to pre-empt the debate or make any suggestion of a guillotine.  Plenty of time should be allowed.  However, that might be a symbolic and good moment for the House to pass the Bill and bring it to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Our group of Independent Senators submitted at least four names of prominent national and international citizens whom we would like to invite to the Chamber to address the House on civic and international matters.  These are important figures from different areas, from both entrepreneurial and civil society.  Does the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have any intention of inviting prominent citizens into the Chamber, especially before the end of February?  I wish to keep the momentum going and I commend the Leader on what he has achieved already.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I also welcome the initiative by the group leaders and the leadership offered by the Leader of the House in welcoming the debate on the fiscal compact, which is very important.  It is an innovation that we will be briefed by the Oireachtas Research and Library Service, publicly in the House.  That is an important part of the Seanad's role.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">When I heard Senator Mac Conghail recall his theatrical experience and, at the same time, wish Senator O'Brien well, I naturally thought he would continue and invite his erstwhile colleague, Senator Coghlan, to break a leg as he goes forward into his new party.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">On a more serious note, I share with Senator Bacik the view that the House should have a debate on abortion, given that it is the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  I do not believe we should necessarily wait until the report of the expert group.  It would be appropriate for us to have a debate very soon on the state of abortion law in Ireland and in other countries.  We could reflect in particular on Britain's barbaric laws in this area.  I believe Senator Bacik was both legally and factually inaccurate, on any objective reading, when she wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day that the decision of the European Court of Human Rights effectively mandates legislation on abortion.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">We should also remember that were we to legislate for the X decision, as Senator Bacik would like us to, we would be talking about no time limits.  Otherwise, that would also be unconstitutional.  The X decision was quite unworkable.  We need to look at this issue in the round and courageously.  In protecting the unborn, we must also ensure women always have the necessary support and solidarity from all institutions of our society so they do not feel they have no other option but abortion.  It draws on all of us to show compassion and imagination as we try and vindicate human rights in a true and proper sense on this most important of issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">Following on from Tuesday night's "Prime Time Investigates" programme and other exposures of criminality, will the Leader inquire if the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will introduce legislation governing the sale of SIM, subscriber identification module, cards?  It is a disgrace that one can walk into any mobile telephone shop to buy any number of SIM cards without any trace or accountability, particularly given that in other countries one needs a passport or other form of identification.  In recent documentaries and programmes such as the RTE series "Raw", it has been shown how criminals throw away SIM cards from their mobile phones after committing crime.  We have had incredible advances in telecommunications in the past decade.  Practically every citizen has a mobile telephone.  However, there are twice as many SIM cards as there are mobile phones.  Questions must be asked about what is going on with so many SIM cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">On Tuesday's "Prime Time Investigates" programme, we saw poor unfortunate women trafficked from Romania and other countries to work as prostitutes here.  The advances in telecommunications have assisted and benefited this most heinous crime.  We need a system to tighten up on the sale and distribution of SIM cards.  One has to be 18 years old to buy cigarettes or alcohol but one can be any age to buy a SIM card.  I commend Senator Zappone for her excellent presentation on Tuesday's "Prime Time" programme on Clare local radio this morning.  This House has led the way in introducing legislation to deal with prostitution.  We must keep our foot on the pedal--</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Will the House send a request to the Iranian Government to show leniency in the case of Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani? He is an Iranian Christian pastor who has been sentenced to death in Tehran for converting from Islam to Christianity.  On all human rights issues this House should take a particular stand.  I will send the Leader the details of this particular case and I hope he will make a case through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Iranian Government to show proper leniency in this case.  It has already offered leniency if Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani recants his Christianity and reconvert to Islam.  Imagine if we had the same approach here to a Christian who converted to Islam.  This case is inhuman.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">It highlights the disadvantage of closing our embassy in Teheran.  It has meant we have lost influence in these countries to protect human rights.  This House could do a great service to Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani who is languishing in a prison for his right to be a Christian.  As Christians, we should defend his right to become and remain a Christian.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I support the call made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last night in Washington for the reinstatement of an OSCE presence in Belarus where there is a continuing erosion of human rights.  Belarus closed the OSCE office in Minsk after OSCE observers called the country's December 2010 presidential elections badly flawed.  Since then, there have been many popular protests against the election but the Belarus Government has cracked down on anyone publicly criticising or protesting against these election results.  Numerous human rights activists, political figures and media workers have been intimidated, beaten, arrested and imprisoned.  All fair-minded people condemned the harassment of opposition and human rights organisations in Belarus.  I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade's initiative yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">All of us have an association with Belarus.  In east Galway and elsewhere, many families host children from orphanages from the country.  This is an issue in which we should support the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I urge the Leader to convey the House's support for his words in Washington last night.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_66">Again, I call for a wide-ranging debate on the economy.  It seems to me we are revisiting the 1970s with the announcement the other day of a new version of passports for sale and now the financial lure in tax breaks for business executives.  There may well be reasons for this but they should be teased out in this House.  To people on the ground who are having their services cut back, it looks obscene that people on enormous amounts of money should have tax concessions of a very considerable nature.  We are moving into a two-tier society.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">I also sympathise with the Greek leader who said they were being put under pressure to sign a document in one hour which will govern the conditions in their country for the next 50 years.  These matters have an effect in how we perceive society and human rights.  When the situation economically is so disastrous, we tend to take our eyes off the ball on other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">For that reason, despite the economic situation, I welcomed yesterday's briefing at the foreign affairs committee indicating the strong possibility that Ireland will receive a seat at the UN human rights committee.  I hope this will happen and it will take up issues such as trafficking which have been highlighted by the foreign affairs committee.  At the committee, I made the point it is not just women who are trafficked and had the wording of a proposed motion changed to "persons".  Adult males and young boys in a small number of circumstances are also trafficked.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">A wide-ranging debate on the economy can take in literature and other unexploited resources.  For example, the short story was invented in this country by Maria Edgeworth, a fact conceded by no less an authority than Chekhov.  We have great women writers like Mary Lavin, almost forgotten now, Molly Keane and others.  Why do we not use these resources?  I would be very grateful if we could have the widest possible debate on the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">"Morning Ireland" this morning carried a story of a new investment of €3 billion from an American source.  The European Commission has commended the way bonds are going in Ireland.  Rather than always downing ourselves, when we see ourselves being praised in Europe and America we should say to ourselves we are going in the right direction.  Everybody recognises we have a lot to do but if we keep hitting ourselves, somebody else will beat us when we are down.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on his initiative in regard to the GoSafe programme for speed cameras.  Although €10 million has been raised through the speed cameras, the programme is intended to save lives rather than a fund-raising exercise.  I would like to know how much of this €10 million will be invested in additional cameras.  The locations of cameras are available online.  I do know if that is a good idea given that we do not yet have a sufficient mass of cameras.  It is easy to go online to find out the location of cameras before starting a journey.  Until such time as there is saturation coverage of cameras, it might be self-defeating to reveal their locations.  Some of the cameras are located at the entrances to towns and villages, which is like catching herrings in a barrel.  I ask the Minister to ensure that GoSafe, the private company operating the programme, puts the cameras in optimal locations.  The programme must be working given that 100,000 penalty points were issued in the past six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I ask the Leader to provide additional time for the debate on the Croke Park agreement.  I do not think 90 minutes is sufficient time to debate all the issues arising and a number of Senators have raised questions in the context of public sector reform.  Certain economic commentators and right-wing elements of the media and Government are attempting to undermine the Croke Park agreement with a view to reducing pay across the board and creating a low-pay economy.  An attempt is also being made to divide and conquer by setting the users of public services against public servants.  Certain public representatives are claiming at public meetings on schools and hospitals that cuts will be required to services unless pay is reduced.  They are trying to play teachers, nurses and doctors against those who depend on public services, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">This House should send the message that public sector workers do a good job in difficult circumstances and they are doing a lot more for a lot less.  Efficiencies have been achieved across Departments and public services.  We will not be able to do justice to public sector workers and those who depend on public services if we did not get an opportunity to tease out the issues arising.  Group spokespersons will have six minutes, the Sinn Féin spokesperson will have two minutes and one minute will be allowed to others who wish to contribute.  Is the Leader prepared to increase the time for debate?</p>

It is a small story but it is nonetheless welcome.  This is the first time we have been able to return to the markets since the disastrous day in 2010 when the troika arrived in our country.

Last week, we explained the difference between a pastoral visit and an official state visit.  The Tánaiste indicated that the Government would facilitate the Pope if he wished to visit.  The Pope can visit without being facilitated by the Government, however.

These comments were unfounded but were not corrected.  A second issue involved a quotation attributed to the Pope which dealt with an entirely different matter relating to the vocation of the theologian but was applied in a pejorative manner to the child abuse scandal.  When that was clarified by the Vatican, the record was not set straight.  The third issue arising was the closure of the residential embassy to the Vatican.  The fourth issue, which disturbed me and many others, was the Clontarf report that sought to discriminate against Catholics in the public service and remove religion from all schools.  Such blatant anti-Catholicism has not yet been disowned by senior people within the Labour Party.  I recognise there are good people in the Labour Party and Fine Gael who share my concerns and would like to see a papal visit.  There is little point in being critical of human rights abuses in respect of freedom of religion in far away countries if we do not stand up against similar breaches of human rights in this country.  I hope we can stand together on this motion rather than divide on it.</p>

It would be appropriate to have a debate on whether someone who graduates from an Irish medical college should be obliged to work in hospitals in Ireland for a minimum period.  We need a detailed debate on the matter.  Providing medical training in universities is a major cost to the taxpayers who are entitled to some payback in that regard.

However, as Archbishop Martin explained, the full fruits would not come from it until the report by the three cardinals involved in the apostolic visitation is published, clarified and dealt with.  We should not rush our fences on this one and should not try to embarrass the Holy See or anybody else.  The Senators have gone somewhat off the wall in some of what they said.</p>

The Minister for Justice and Equality should come to the House to explain how €14.5 million has been spent on overtime, allowances, travel and subsistence, PRSI, etc., for gardaí at the Bellanaboy plant in County Mayo.  In 2011, €913,000 was spent, with €3.5 million in 2010 and €5 million in 2007.  We heard during yesterday's Private Members' debate that it would cost €15 million to retain rural schools and now we hear that an extra €15 million was spent on overtime and related costs.  I will go a little further while not jumping to any conclusions about media reports.  This morning the Minister, Deputy Shatter was reported as saying "some protesters behave in a self-indulgent way that has no regard for the rights of others."

Senators may be aware of a proposal from the institutes of technology in the north west in particular to come together as a multi-campus university of technology.  This proposal is not getting the kind of attention it requires from the Higher Education Authority and from the Government and should be debated here.  In mentioning that it would be remiss of me not to mention a national project launched this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, which from a research point of view is being headed up by Sligo Institute of Technology.  It is an EU-approved pilot electronic invoicing project, which over a period of time will lead to savings of €250 million per year.  It will increase competitiveness for businesses and will increase efficiencies in the public service.  In the context of a multi-campus university of technology, one can see from today's initiative just one example of the kinds of strides that can be made in applied research from the institute of technology sector throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">I thank the lead researcher, Edmund Gray, and lecturer, Pádraig Harte, of Sligo Institute of Technology, who, following the launch today, have taken the time to come and listen to us here in the House.  They are very welcome.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_160">"That Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to convey to the Holy See at official level, and through existing diplomatic channels, that it would welcome the opportunity of extending an official invitation to Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland at a time of mutual convenience."</p>
          <p eId="para_161">It is purposely worded in a mild, modest and careful way to extend the invitation or to seek at official level through existing channels to welcome the opportunity of extending an official invitation.  This could be and should be supported by all sides of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">We are all aware that church-State relationships have not been good for some time past.  People on both sides of the argument have felt hurt in this regard.  Often, this comes down to individual families.  I believe Senators will have noticed the feeling abroad that it is time to move on.  If we do not move on when the opportunity arises, it may not come again in the near future.  The Eucharistic Congress will involve people from throughout the world coming to Ireland.  If there is an indication that church-state relationships are still at a low and fragile ebb it will not be good for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">There is an opportunity today to show that the Seanad has given careful consideration to this, to show that we are prepared to move on and that we are prepared to do what is right at the right time.  I believe genuinely that this is the right time.  No one need believe we are losing face in any way by doing so.  The Seanad can set an example.  As Senator Feargal Quinn stated, the motion before us is delicately worded and it in no way attempts to be triumphalist or confrontational.  It simply tries to set the position in Ireland straight in respect of this relationship which we all cherished in the past.  It would do good for the Seanad, the country and its future in the context of church-state relationships.  We should do this today and try to be unanimous in this regard.  I call on the Leader to reflect on the wording of the motion.  It is in no way anti-Government, nor is it anti- any political party.  It simply reflects what we are hearing from people, not from a select body of people but widespread views throughout the State at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">We are being examined very closely internationally.  Last week, a major delegation from Britain went to meet the Pope to discuss issues of human rights and many other issues as well.  Given the closure of the Irish Embassy at the Vatican and by not taking the opportunity to send the right message, we are not doing what our constituents are keen for us to do.  I call on the Leader to reflect on and consider whether there is some way forward to get this message to the Government.</p>

I commend the Garda on its prompt recovery of the weapon and vehicle involved.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House in order that we can raise the issues of gangs, gang warfare and the difficulties that arise?  This is still a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland.  There is much to be learned from other countries, where the problems arising from gangs have been around for far too long and where they have experience of the way in which gangs relate to drugs and the sale of drugs.  Given all the difficulties and dilemmas facing the country at the moment it is easy to forget the people who are caught up, in this case, it would appear, innocently, in such trouble.  When a young girl loses her life in this way it is time for the House to ask the Minister to address this particular point, as opposed to asking the Minister for Justice and Equality to come and talk about crime.  I wish to be appraised of where we are headed and how the Garda is set to cope with the problems that will surely only increase in the years to come.</p>

In simple terms, the objective of the Government is to significantly reduce the overall cost to taxpayers of the promissory note arrangements that we inherited from the previous Government.  The Senator is aware that the troika will bring forward a common paper in the coming weeks.  This gives us the basis of an opportunity to move forward on this area of debt.  It is a medium-term strategy and the decision-making process in the EU will take time, of that there is no question.  I am sure the Senator is aware of this.</p>

The director general of the OSCE was in the Visitors Gallery last week when the Tánaiste was present.

I am sure the Senator will take part in the debate and outline his comments to the Minister.  He also commented on the Finance Bill.  The points can be raised in March when the Finance Bill is before the House.  The Senator is correct in that the Tánaiste outlined that Ireland was seeking a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council.  I hope we will win a seat on the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Senator Keane raised a number of issues and she and Senator Gilroy welcome the return to the bond markets, which is a positive sign which should be and has been acknowledged in the <i>Financial Times</i> and other economic commentaries.

I outlined that yesterday and will not go over it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Senator Cullinane asked for more time for the debate on the Croke Park agreement.  We have arranged for a one and a half hour debate and it will be followed by another with another Minister attending the House.  The timing has to do with the availability of Ministers to attend the House.  The debate was only requested two weeks ago but we will make more time available for a debate on the issue at a later stage.

          <p eId="para_189">The Tánaiste has explained that, as with the Queen's visit, there are significant protocols to go through.  There is significant tic-tacking between embassies, officials and at government level.  The same goes for the proposed visit of the Pope.  The Irish bishops are in negotiation with the Holy See.  When an indication is given that the Pope would like to or intends to visit, the invitation will issue.  The Taoiseach has said that the Pope will be made very welcome and an invitation will be issued immediately that indication is given.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">There is no question of the Government not inviting the Pope.  It must go through the proper protocols.  I hope the Fianna Fáil Members raising this issue will speak to their party leader, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he can advise them on the protocols for such a visit.  Therefore, I hope the Senators will withdraw their motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Senator Colm Burke made a good point on the issue of medical training in universities.  This is something to which the Minister for Health alluded yesterday and I am sure we will come back to that issue at some stage.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I am aware that a number of Senators have been seeking a debate of this nature for some time.  I am delighted to be here.  The Croke Park agreement was put in place as part of a strategic response to an unprecedented economic crisis.  Since 2008, this country has been struggling to bridge an enormous and unsustainable fiscal deficit.  I do not intend to go into detail on the origins of this crisis and who is to blame for it.  Opinions on such issues have been put on the record many times before.  The significant gap between what we are spending as a nation and the revenues we are raising to pay for that spending needs to be closed.  We are bound by our commitments to our international partners because we depend on them to pay our way, particularly between now and 2013.  The Government's overriding priority is for this country to regain full control of its own affairs as quickly as possible.  To that end, we will continue to take difficult but necessary decisions to put our house in order.  We understand that future economic growth will come from a solid and sustainable fiscal position.  Fortunately, the 2011 Exchequer returns confirmed that we are comfortably meeting the deficit targets under the EU-IMF programme.  The budget we introduced in December continues this sustainable path for our deficit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_257">We will get a copy of it as soon as possible.  The difficulty is that at a time when we have to reduce costs significantly, the demands on public services are greater than ever.  This creates a real challenge.  We are delivering considerably more financial supports and services to our people with fewer resources.  The cost of jobseekers' payments is now more than three times the 2006 level.  There are 500,000 more medical card holders than in 2007.  Demographic changes mean there are more children to teach and more public pensions to be paid.  This means we have to drive productivity.  When we ask whether productivity has increased, the answer is "Yes".  Costs have come down and staff numbers have fallen, but services are still being delivered.  We need to go further, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Croke Park agreement was reached in 2010 between the Government, as employer, and the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is designed to support a reduction in payroll costs and the continued delivery and maintenance of high quality services against a backdrop of reducing resources and staff numbers.  Its aim is to ensure the public service continues its contribution to the return of economic growth.  When we consider the value of the agreement, it is important to recall that it was preceded by an escalating and damaging programme of industrial action by public servants in early 2010, which disrupted the provision of important services to the public.  The agreement has been successful in delivering widespread industrial peace at a time of unparalleled difficulty and change.  It has been endorsed by trade unions and staff associations across the public service.  Staff are co-operating with its provisions around change and reform.  It has provided the necessary conditions in which difficult decisions can be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">We need to reduce costs while meeting increased demand for front-line services.  That means we have to fundamentally reform how public services are delivered.  The Government set out an ambitious blueprint for change in the public service reform plan that it launched last November.  The plan sets out a wide range of actions and commitments that will radically reform structures, operations and processes across the public service.  A key element of the plan is the planned reduction of 23,500 in the number of people employed in the public service between the end of 2010 and the end of 2015.  In 2008, there were approximately 320,000 people working in the Irish public service, in its totality.  By the end of 2015, that number will be just over 280,000.  We envisage that between 2008 and 2015, the number of personnel across the public service will have reduced by approximately 37,500.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_153" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_261">That will be a substantial reduction over a seven-year period.  I recently addressed our parliamentary colleagues in the Bundestag.  They asked how we are managing to knock out between 12% and 14% of the public service while meeting ongoing demands.  They wondered why more protests are not happening on our streets.  We have managed this change without street protests, at a time of substantial difficulty, because the Croke Park agreement is in place.  I contend that the agreement will play a key role in facilitating the delivery of the planned reduction in staff numbers.  The co-operation and engagement of staff across the public service is vital if we are to do this successfully.   The buy-in of staff at all levels is needed if the significant redeployment, restructuring, rationalising and reconfiguration that is needed is take place.  We will not be able to do that, in a highly unionised and disciplined workforce, if the workers oppose us.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">There appears to be a widespread misunderstanding about what the Croke Park agreement is and is not.  It is important to emphasise that it is not a cost-saving plan in itself.  Savings are made when the Government or the management of the public service decide to implement change to services and work practices, introduce new technology and agree that the number of public servants can or must be reduced.  The agreement provides the consultation framework to manage changes in work practices and service delivery, boost productivity and improve efficiencies as the number of public servants decreases over time.  The agreement is a mechanism for securing the active co-operation of staff for the changes that are needed to ensure the significant ongoing reduction in staff numbers does not have an adverse impact on services.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In many respects, the Croke Park agreement is the exact opposite of a partnership agreement.  Rather than paying and hoping for the best, the deal makes it clear that if public servants do not help us to extract costs, improve productivity and implement reform, we will not be able to stand by our commitments to them.  The unions understand what the agreement involves.  The deal for the public services is twofold.  We have agreed not to hack away at salaries again, to use an awful phrase, as long as two conditions are met.  First, the personnel reductions that are set out in the plan need to be achieved.  Second, the reform agenda has to be bought into and supported.  I admit that the second aspect of the deal is more nebulous, but it has to be achieved in 2012.  We have made it clear to the unions that if they work with us on the reform agenda, by keeping front-line services in place while totally altering the deployment of back-office staff, we will be able to meet our pay, numbers and pensions commitments.  They have to buy into the concept of doing things in a totally different way as any business would have to do in these circumstances.  I think the unions understand that it is a two-way process.  They have managed to meet us in terms of the agreement we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">We have to address the misperception about the contribution public servants have made towards our recovery.  It is too often a case of "eaten bread is soon forgotten".  The reality is that the take-home pay of public servants has been significantly impacted since 2008.  I refer to the following: the non-payment of the general round pay increases under the terms of the 2008 review of the Towards 2016 transitional agreement; the imposition of the pension-related deduction of an average of almost 7% to all the earnings of all public servants in March 2009; and the reduction of between 5% and 20%, depending on salary level, in the rates of pay of public servants.  We tend to forget that the average pay reduction suffered by a public servant has been 15%.  The average reduction at the top has been 30%.  Consideration also needs to be given to the universal social charge, PRSI and all the levies that have been put in place.  We often forget that the real and substantial reductions which have occurred since 2008 have made a huge difference to the earning capacity and spending power of public servants, many of whom have substantial mortgages and are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  We often hear about the glorious example of the elite at the top of the Irish public service, but are we fully aware that the great majority of public servants are having to cope on a daily basis with the significant reductions in their take-home pay and do more work in return for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_265">That is what we and they face in the teeth of the economic crisis.  The Croke Park agreement has provided the framework of co-operation and flexibility to enable us to extract all of these necessary savings from the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  The impact of all of these measures is that the total net cost of the public service pay bill will be reduced from 2008 to 2015 by approximately €3.5 billion, that is, 20% in seven years.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">The figure refers to pay.  We will come to the Senator's contribution in a moment.  Pensions must be paid in any case.  A 20% reduction in the pay bill is a staggering fall in the cost of employing public servants to deliver public services.  It is unprecedented in the history of the State and I suggest it is a larger reduction than those achieved in the majority of private enterprises with significant staff costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I will now address what has been achieved under the Croke Park agreement since 2010.  Members will be aware that an implementation body was established in July 2010 to drive implementation of the agreement.  The body comprises of representatives from public service management and members of the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is chaired by Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick, a retired senior official with a track record of delivering change in public service bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The body's key functions are to monitor and oversee progress on implementing the agreement, to cost and verify savings being achieved under the framework of the agreement and to deal with implementation issues that arise.  To support its work the body has established a series of subgroups to oversee implementation within each sector.  In addition, every sector and public service organisation is obliged to produce an action plan setting out in detail the specific change and reform measures to be taken forward under the Croke Park framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The agreement provides for a comprehensive review to be undertaken each year by the implementation body, focusing on assessing the sustainable savings achieved and progress on implementing the change and reform agenda in each sector.  The first such review was carried out by the implementation body last May and culminated in the publication last June of the first annual progress report.  In its report, the body found that sustainable savings in the Exchequer pay bill of €289 million had been achieved in the first year of the agreement, driven primarily by the decline in public service numbers but also by reduced overtime costs and other work practice changes.  It also identified examples of some €308 million in non-pay savings through better use of resources, re-organisation of work and achievement of greater internal efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Overall, the implementation body found that "solid and measurable progress" had been made.  It concluded that in the period under review staff numbers had fallen substantially and more quickly than previously estimated, services had been maintained and in some cases expanded and productivity had increased.  Moreover, the cost of delivering public services had fallen in a sustainable way, primarily through reducing head count across the public service, enabling the State to meet its external economic and fiscal commitments; thousands of staff had been redeployed, including across functional boundaries.  This helped to meet two challenges, namely, avoiding gaps in service as numbers reduced and changing the way in which public services are delivered to citizens and business.  It also concluded that the reconfiguration of services had commenced in earnest.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Last November, the body produced an interim update which provided further evidence of ongoing progress on reducing the cost and size of the public service and reforms aimed at building a leaner, more integrated and streamlined public service.  In terms of the progress to date public service staff numbers have fallen by more than 20,000 since 2008 and will fall further in the coming weeks as the 29 February deadline approaches.  Despite this decline, services have by and large been maintained and in some cases improved.  This is against the backdrop of increasing demands for services provided by the State.  For example, more than 1 million medical card applications and reviews have been processed since July last year alone and volumes in the social welfare payments area have also increased considerably.  Prisoner numbers have risen, as have the numbers of students in our universities and institutes of technology as staff numbers in these areas have fallen.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Redeployment is one of the key tools provided by the Croke Park agreement to help protect services as numbers fall.  Under the agreement staff are being moved to areas of greatest need.  For example, more than 1,000 staff of the community welfare service have been redeployed from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social Protection.  Further, in excess of 500 staff have been redeployed from Government Departments to the Department of Social Protection to meet increased demands on social welfare offices and services.  Moreover, 700 staff from FÁS are in the process of being redeployed into the Department of Social Protection.  In the education sector, new redeployment procedures for second level teachers were implemented in 2011, resulting in the elimination of a surplus of approximately 200 teachers, with a consequent full year saving of €10 million, and the redeployment of approximately 850 surplus primary school teachers has delivered further savings of €50 million.  In the health sector, more than 750 staff were redeployed internally in the six months from April to September 2011 alone as services were reconfigured.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Measures are also being implemented under the agreement to increase productivity and efficiency.  For example, additional working hours have been implemented in schools and universities.  Parents will have noticed fewer in-house training days and so forth, which is a direct benefit of the agreement.  New working arrangements are being implemented for radiographers and those working in medical laboratories in the health sector with accompanying savings in expenditure.  Outmoded practices such as bank time and privilege days have been eliminated in the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Staff are also co-operating with efforts to rationalise and streamline the public service.  For example, progress is being made on rationalising the number of vocational education committees from 33 to 16.  In my Department the Office of Public Works is rationalising its office accommodation portfolio.  In 2010, for instance, we surrendered 27,000 sq. m. of space, achieving savings of nearly €10 million.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc, the Revenue Commissioners and the Courts Service are all engaged in rationalising their office space.  A special delivery unit has been established to re-organise services in the health sector.  Efficiency reviews of all prisons are continuing and are on track to deliver savings of €21 million.  By late last year, the National Procurement Service, NPS, in the Office of Public Works had put in place 45 national framework agreements and contracts for high spend requirements which are helping to significantly reduce the cost of purchasing goods and services across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Two years ago, the State spent €16.5 billion per annum on the procurement of goods and services.  While I do not have the full figure for 2011, I expect that it will have declined to approximately €14.5 billion, achieving a saving of roughly €2 billion for the State.  While we are spending less on capital, the State is also radically reducing expenditure by achieving greater efficiencies.  I can point to contracts arranged by the National Procurement Service last year which secured savings of €21 million in the area of energy and €80 million in group print management costs.  We are, therefore, spending less, securing better value for money and achieving greater efficiencies.  I do not make any apologies for eliminating local procurers by centralising the procurement process.  We are doing exactly what the private sector has been doing in the past decade in the teeth of crises such as that which we currently face.  We will continue to achieve substantial savings.  We need the support of Members in these endeavours because procurement will be an essential part of public sector reform if we are to spend less and obtain greater efficiencies in expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Steps have also been taken to integrate the public service.  For example, legislation has been published for a new single pension scheme for all new entrants to the public service and new standardised annual leave arrangements have been introduced.  New standardised sick leave arrangements will be progressed during 2012.  This week I sought and received from the Government a mandate to introduce shared services.  To cite an example of the shared services approach, 810 people are working on human resources in Departments.  By the end of 2014, a shared human resources service will be in place which will employ approximately 350 people.  This will provide us with the capacity to redeploy hundreds of staff who will not join the shared service.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">We also have the power under the Croke Park agreement to demand that staff move up to 45 km., regardless of whether they wish to do so.  That concession was given under the agreement and we can also redeploy staff within and between Departments.  Ultimately, we will be able to redeploy people from local authorities to central government and to see it as one seamless service of public servants, all of whom are paid by the State and prepared to work with us in a totally reconfigured public service.  These are the changes which are happening despite the fantastic headlines one reads in some Sunday newspapers every so often as well as the frightening analysis and so on.  These are the actual changes which are happening, namely, shared services, redeployment, better procurement, efficiency savings, doing things better and introducing technology where people were previously in place.  We are following that model and we are succeeding.  We want the support of people as we attempt to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Government's view is that the Croke Park agreement can be an important asset as we seek to put the economy on a more sustainable footing.  The implementation body, to which I referred, under Mr. Fitzpatrick will conduct its next annual review of the agreement after Easter.  It is critical that its report, which we expect by June, shows tangible evidence of further savings and reform being delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Some weeks ago, I made a direct appeal to public sector unions to get on with the task of working with us on the sectoral plans which are now coming into our Department and which are being worked on.  What are those sectoral plans about?  They are about changes in rostering and effectively getting rid of some premium payments.  If people worked on Saturdays and Sundays, they would get double time but that will change.  That is the kind of approach of which we would like to see early delivery from the public sector unions this year.  I think 2012 will be a critical year for the agreement, for public sector unions and to get some of these changes, which have been left to this year, over the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I use this Chamber to appeal directly to the public service unions to continue to travel the road with us.  We have already demonstrated significant achievements to date.  More needs to be done and 2012 is the time when additional change must occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">It is clear a solid start has been made under the Croke Park agreement but there is no room whatsoever for complacency.  The economic and fiscal environment is volatile and uncertain and we must respond accordingly.  The evolving economic environment means we need to go much further under the agreement while the task of reforming the public service — of ensuring that each part of this incredibly complex system is working efficiently for its customers — is never-ending.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">In this regard, each sector has been asked by the implementation body to revise its action plans under the agreement in order that they support the new Government targets on public service numbers and payroll reductions and take account of relevant decisions arising from the recent comprehensive review of expenditure in 2012.  These plans must be ambitious in their scope and timeframe for delivery and they must seek to exploit the full potential of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The priority for the Government will be to use the framework provided by the agreement to: maximise the productivity of the existing staff through, for example, the announced sick leave reform, redeployment, new rostering arrangements for gardaí and nurses, for example, and better performance management; extract additional costs wherever possible, for example, through the Government's comprehensive review of allowances and premia pay; and enable the ambitious public service reform programme, which we launched just before Christmas, to be fully implemented across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Government expects hard won management agendas to be pursued by sectoral management even where that means some difficult negotiations.  I must warn the House that some of the challenges facing both sides will push that forbearance to its limits.  It may be that we will see a greater level of resistance than before.  If that is case, those advocating it will be playing into the hands of those from various quarters calling for a renegotiated Croke Park agreement.  Those calling for a renegotiation are very vague about what this means.  They need to be explicit about the alternative strategy they put forward and be upfront about what that would mean for our teachers, gardaí, nurses and other ordinary public servants in terms of further cuts in pay and compulsory rather than voluntary redundancies.  Importantly, they also must consider the potential wider impacts in terms of the inevitable severe disruption which would be caused by widespread industrial action across the public service.  Those who argue for some alternative yet to be defined are effectively arguing for some kind of nuclear winter which this country would face by throwing the situation into crisis mode.  I say that to people who speak freely about getting rid of the Croke Park agreement or about renegotiating it.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">——what the alternative is and be upfront with the people.  What we have achieved to date — there is much more to be done — is a phenomenal achievement in the context of where this country is currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The truth is that the critics of the agreement on both sides do not appear to have any credible alternatives.  Any alternatives must have regard to those working within the public service who are called on to deliver more services in difficult circumstances, in an environment where resources have never been so stretched and who are themselves taxpayers, mortgage holders and participants in the wider economy.  That said, the Government will fully support management acting to drive the reform agenda and extract unnecessary costs from the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">There are no easy solutions to the challenges we face.  We must bring public expenditure back to sustainable levels while maintaining front line services and delivering improvements where possible.  That will not be easy, of course.  The bottom line is that the Croke Park agreement has delivered to date.  That has been demonstrated by the implementation body.  It is critical that it continues to deliver.  The agreement cannot, and was never intended to, be the solution to all of our problems but it can make an important contribution to ensuring stability and certainty, the necessary foundations for a return to growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">We must have a more informed debate about all of these issues.  There has been far too much populist, ill-informed comment about the public finances and the Croke Park agreement.  This has had the effect of creating deep divisions between the private sector and those working in the public sector.  That kind of false dichotomy, or false fight, between the public and private sectors does no one any good.  It is a fundamental lie for those not so much in this House but outside it to perpetuate some kind of continuous battle between the public and the private sectors for their own selfish ends.  We need people working together in a totally changed environment to get us through this enormous crisis.  We need people working together, whether from the public sector or the private sector, to ensure this country has a future.  That is what we intend to achieve and if the Croke Park agreement is part of the solution to that, then so be it.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a chur in iúl don Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív maidir lena mháthair a fuair bás, Emer Í Chuív, iníon dheireanach Éamon de Valera.  Tá brón ar pháirtí Fhianna Fáil agus cuirim ár gcomhbhrón in iúl.  I welcome the Minister of State and his robust defence of the Croke Park agreement and robust challenge to those involved in it to continue it to its logical conclusions and to further develop, promote and enhance the public service.  However, he must acknowledge that much of the criticism of the Croke Park agreement is coming from his own party members in the Oireachtas, and I agree with him that it is very ill-informed in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Do these people calling for the abolition of the Croke Park agreement, in particular from Fine Gael, know what is in it because, in effect, what they are calling for are pay cuts, redundancies and a stop to progress in implementing reforms or some other way to force people to reform?  That is what they are doing and I am not sure if they realise it.  My impression is that some Members of the Oireachtas believe it applies to very senior civil servants and that if one abolishes the Croke Park agreement, one would be cutting the pay of those at the very top.  That is not the reality.  If the Croke Park agreement is abolished, every public servant would be hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">It is important to acknowledge that the Croke Park agreement is a singular achievement of the last Fianna Fáil-led Government and the last Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, which the Minister of State did not do.  The Croke Park agreement was not supported by the Labour Party when it was put in place because of its ties to the union movement.  I am glad it is now on board.  The Minister of State is right to continue to call for debate on it and to continue to challenge his own colleagues and the unions.  While substantial progress has been made, more needs to be done in the local authority sector in particular.  People who will be paying the €100 household charge will expect enhanced services from their local authorities.  At the very least, they will expect to receive replies from local councils on whether something can be done.  That will require further reform in local authorities and there is already substantial evidence of public demand for this type of reform, which the Croke Park agreement cannot deliver.  At the moment, the main challenge for the Minister and the Government is to ensure that front line services are protected and that the public will not be made to suffer reduced or impaired services unnecessarily, but that has not happened.  Much of the planning for what is going on has been done on the hoof.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">In my own HSE region of Dublin north-east, 20 public health nurses are retiring.  Some 31 will be retiring in HSE west, which is very badly affected.  Those retirements are having a huge effect on a much smaller population.  In my area, however, public health nurses are under severe pressure.  One public health nurse told me that she dealt with 30 births in one month last summer, on top of all her other duties.  There is a huge demand and that is one aspect of the health service that will be hit due to lack of planning by the Government for this particular eventuality.  In the Dublin north-east region alone, 740 HSE staff are retiring.  The figure for Dublin mid-Leinster is 931, HSE south 1,038, and HSE west 1,106.  Those retirements will have a big knock-on effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">We have heard the Taoiseach talk of transition teams.  I was in and out for the Minister of State's speech, but I do not recall having heard the term "transition teams" in it.  Is there a reason for that?  Are there really such teams or, as was alleged in a newspaper during the week, was the Taoiseach just making things up as he went along?  That was alleged by a serious political commentator.  It is a serious allegation that needs to be responded to.  If these transition teams are not in place, it is a very serious situation.  It does not appear that the Minister of State has referred to them.  The approach taken by various Ministers is that it will be all right on the night.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">In addition, the approach to the Croke Park agreement taken by various Ministers has been unfortunate.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has in effect laid the blame on nurses, asking them to change their work practices.  In one case, wards were closed and subsequently nurses were told that the wards would not have closed if they had changed their work practices, although there was no awareness of that.  I know one nurse who works any hours she is asked to do — nine to five, sleepovers, long days, overnights and six hour shifts.  I am surprised that work practices are an issue because in many sectors nurses are working incredibly flexible hours.  It is unfair of the Minister for Health to be talking in generalised terms, saying that nurses are all working long days to avoid doing a proper week's work.  Not all nurses are working long days.  I know one nurse who this week is working a nine to five, an eight to four, a long day and a sleepover.  That is a lot of work for a nurse, and many other nurses are working such shifts all over the country.  It is not fair therefore to blame nurses for hospital ward closures after the fact.  As the Minister of State suggested, we should instead continue to engage with them under the terms of the Croke Park agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The issue of gardaí is a serious one.  The Government made some progress following a call by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, to fill vacancies.  The Government filled some of them, but not all.  It was unfortunate, however, that the Garda Commissioner had to put pressure on the Government because he should not have to do so.  It shows a failure by the Government to deal with this issue and plan for changes that are happening now.  There is no point in blaming Fianna Fáil because we stood over the Croke Park agreement as it was being negotiated, endorsed it and set it as our policy.  The Government has now had a year to plan for the changes that have been made as a result of these early retirements arising from overall public sector reductions.  I accept that the Minister of State has not blamed Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I will start by quoting from a speech that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, gave himself, as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_306">We can get the number of public servants out of the system to get a small public sector.  We are doing that with the co-operation of the unions, but the second aspect is whether or not we get the buy-in on reforms on things like rostering and a change in work practices.  What I am saying is that 2012 is the year to deliver that, and more.  Unless we are ambitious and unless we are urgent about that, all the issues are back on the agenda again.  We have not just said that it is now in the memorandum of understanding; it is the agreement that has been made with our international funders to get this economy floated again.</p>

          <from>Senator Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I am sceptical about the Croke Park agreement.  Senator Byrne asked for alternatives and said that people of my opinion were creating a crisis mode.  I have a serious problem with the scenario of jobs for life.  I have seen people in the public sector who are not up to the job.  They may suffer from burn-out or just not be capable of carrying out a job out of work, yet it is impossible to get rid of them.  It does not lie well with me.  In a recent speech, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said: "The Government reaffirms its commitment under the Croke Park agreement on pay rates and job security for serving public servants."  Therefore job security will not be up for question.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Recently, I spoke to a senior manager in the public sector who said that if he was allowed to remove the people he wanted to remove from his staff, he could reduce numbers by 20% and increase productivity.  That is a very strong and telling statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Public sector payroll savings this year will be up to €400 million and will reach €3.5 billion by 2015, which is approximately 20%.  The Croke Park agreement is not for short-term gain, however, and as has been stated many times we are in receivership.  I do not know of any receiver or liquidator who gives five-year plans for receivership.  This year, the Croke Park agreement will cost €600 million in lump sum payments and up to €1 billion with pensions, to achieve staff reductions by the end of this month.  While Croke Park is a long-term plan, the country is in crisis now.  If over 65,000 public sector workers took a 5% pay reduction it would be immediate and would achieve what needs to be done much more quickly.  I accept that there would be pain but I have not mentioned increments.  We must wake up and smell the coffee in respect of how we are seen abroad.  In this country, members of the public sector get half an hour on Friday to cash a cheque yet they are paid by electronic funds transfer.  Let us get a grip.  I am led to believe that was not up for renegotiation in the Croke Park agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">Some ground has been made up.  The Minister of State asked for an alternative idea and I referred to a 5% pay cut on salaries over €65,000.  Through better procurement, the Minister of State has made savings but there is more fat and room for more savings.  I suggest that officials from the Department of Finance could go into the credit unions as special managers and carry out the work being carried out by private firms at €423 an hour.  It could be done by officials from the Department rather than private companies that are part of the big consortiums.  I would like to see progress made on this.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryAnnOBrien" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Senator Mary Ann O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his in-depth presentation.  I refer to this issue in passing during other debates in this Chamber.  I usually bring it up in the context of some cut that is adversely affecting individuals and groups in the State.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss specifically the Croke Park agreement.  As a business owner in the private sector, I am fully aware of the need to have peaceful and positive industrial relations in order to run an efficient business.  In this regard, it amazes me that we do not see trade unions protesting outside the gates of this complex on a regular basis in light of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  This leads me to question why the unions are so timid in their objection to current policies.  I can only draw the conclusion that the Croke Park agreement favours and protects the best interests of the unions and they do not wish to rock the boat for fear of less favourable conditions for their membership.  As a country, can we afford the Croke Park agreement any longer?</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We are all in agreement that the public sector needs major reforms urgently.  It is my belief that the Croke Park agreement is not the tool to achieve meaningful and real reform of our public service.  With each passing day, we see mounting problems within the State-provided services.  Yesterday evening I met someone working in this House as an intern.  Her sister has a child in Walkinstown with Prader-Willi syndrome, which is the most sad and awful syndrome with which any family could be struck.  That family has two wonderful social workers; one gives wonderful advice on nutrition and how to guide the baby to achieve a good result, the other is a social worker laying out a plan.  Both are taking redundancy packages and the Minister of State has heard countless such cases.  It is a disgrace and the family is left wondering how it will cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The two main areas where the Croke Park agreement falls down is the flexibility the agreement permits and the speed at which reforms are introduced.  What is required is a private sector ideology in our public services to deliver efficient and timely services despite shrinking budgets.  On 29 February, 7,000 public servants will retire.  While it is clear that we need to reduce drastically the number employed as part of the reform, one must question the voluntary scheme.  What genius came up with the date of 29 February?  Imagine that we are running a school.  I do not have to imagine because I have a boy doing his leaving certificate.  Imagine the administration that it will take to make teachers redundant on 29 February and rehire them, I hope at the same cost, to keep those children taught properly to achieve their examination results in June.  If we were running a business like we were running a school, it would spell disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">We hear Government representatives state that this voluntary package is the brainchild of the past Government and that it inherited it.  This may be true but the current Government has been in power for almost a year and is free to make changes at any time to the terms and conditions but it has chosen not to do so.  The flaws are numerous.  That there is no compulsory element in this round of redundancies is ludicrous.  At the end of the month we will lose hundreds of highly skilled people in specialised areas, with no way of replacing them without fresh recruitment, which involves additional outlay.  This could have been avoided if redundancies were targeted at areas within the public service where there is excess.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The Minister of State said he hears all the time about the public sector and the private sector.  Taking a small business like mine, with 100 people, in 2008 the world economy collapsed and world currencies went crazy.  I had to make a 25% cut in my workforce.  If I had suggested voluntary redundancies of 25% of the workforce, Lily O'Brien's would have been gone.  I do not know how the public sector is coping.  Some of the people who have been with me for 12 and 14 years, such as my financial controller and my CEO, might have been the ones to come forward.  One cannot run a business like that.  I fail to understand the thinking behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">On 7 December, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Minister of State stated that the Government is expected to pay out between €250 million and €300 million in increments in the year ahead for public service staff who are due to move up a further point in their pay scales.  The Minister of State said that the issue of increments for public service may well have to be revisited.  I would love to work in the public service because my job is safe for life and my increments are there.  I hope the Minister of State will revisit it.</p>

        <speech by="#AideenHayden" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden</from>
          <p eId="para_320">I propose to share time with Senator Moloney.  I welcome the Minister of State.  Senator Thomas Byrne never disappoints.  I remind him that 16 years of Fianna Fáil in government preceded today's situation.  With regard to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's contribution, I remind her that the date set, 29 February, was set by the previous Administration.  I also noted the comments of Senator Byrne with regard to the Labour Party.  Is it some power crazed thing in Fianna Fáil that it is not only content with 16 years in government but also tied the hands of the next Government?  I am proud that the Labour Party supports the Croke Park agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I am disturbed at much of what I read and hear in the media.  It is not being said that we have an admirable public service in this country and an admirable public service ethos.  I am not reading about all of the occasions when public servants are at the front of the people facing the dole, put in extra hours and deal with distressed and upset people.  Day in and day out, they do a public service for this country but unfortunately I have a list of media content in which that is not being emphasised.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Minister of State referred to the huge amount of us and them, division between those people with safe, secure, highly paid jobs on the one hand and everyone else living in deep uncertainty.  That is not true and it is a point to which I will return.  I resent the media implication that there is a major division between the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party on the Croke Park agreement because it is not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">On under-performance in the public service, I want to refer to the PMDS system.  There was a review on its effectiveness in 2010.  It has been agreed and acknowledged that it is a system that needs to work better to strengthen performance management.  There is also a robust system in place to examine effectiveness and efficiencies within the public service.  It is not true to say that people sit in the public service with jobs for life and their effectiveness is never subject to review.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">We have the agreement because it makes sense.  We are not Greece or Ireland in the 1980s.  I lived through Ireland in the 1980s.  I was doing my leaving certificate at the time and had to study by candlelight.   Is that what people in this country want?  We have a system whereby we have an agreement with our public servants.  Sacrifices have been made on both sides, including by public servants.  As the Minister of State said, very significant cuts have been suffered by our public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The issue of increments is very contentious.  A number of people in the media have painted this to be the big bogey of the Croke Park agreement.  I do not know whether a lot of people know that those who would be most impacted by the failure to pay increments are the lowest paid public servants in the country, not the highly paid public servants people are so keen to highlight in the media.  Increments affect those who earn between €23,000 and €37,000 over a period of 17 years.  New entrants at that grade have had their salaries reduced to €20,000 up to €33,000.  I do not know how many staff in Lily O'Briens are earning that kind of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">A lot of women are the most poorly paid in the Irish Civil Service and public service.  In terms of increments, there will be a review of the agreement in April 2012.  The lower paid grades of the public service have suffered most from the agreement.  I ask that we return to the agreement and see how we can rebalance its effects on lower paid public servants.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieMoloney" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Senator Marie Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_327">The Minister of State took the wind out of my sails today because he gave a very extensive report on the working of the Croke Park agreement.  I had researched it but I will not repeat what he said.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Many people have said they want to break the agreement.  Have they really thought that out in terms of what it would do to the country?  The public sector has the potential to bring this country to a standstill.  We would have strikes and people would work to rule.  Those who called for the agreement to be broken would tell us it is our fault if that was happening and we should do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">We have stopped strikes and people working to rule through the introduction of the Croke Park agreement.  We did not enter into it lightly.  Negotiations took place between many parties, including trade unions and the Government.  It was not done overnight, it took a long time to negotiate.  We are now getting co-operation, flexibility and mobility from public sector workers all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The problem is that the media will always portray what it wants to and put its own spin on things.  Will it look at what is going on in local authorities?  Refuse workers have moved onto the roads painlessly.  Things are happening quietly and negotiations are taking place behind the scenes.  In the health sector cleaners, porters and domestic staff have all been redeployed to other jobs.  Such changes are happening painlessly and without an uproar.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The education sector is of most concern.  I implore people not to break the agreement but to keep it in place.  It is working.  As people say, why fix something that is not broken.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_332">The Acting Chairman is a disciplinarian and is keeping us on our toes.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I found this debate very interesting.  I like to hear a Minister of State who is in control of his or her brief, knows what he or she is talking about and is determined to put it across.  I do not think the Minister of State is right in everything he said, but he has asked those of us who are critical to be more explicit.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien was explicit in what she said.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I have argued that we should be running the country more like a business.  If a business is in trouble, it renegotiates with suppliers in order to survive.  The Croke Park agreement does not go far enough in this respect.  It does not seem to be working and even if it was it would be very difficult to argue that we can afford it because things have changed since it was put into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Now that the Central Bank has cut its forecast we are borrowing from month to month to keep afloat, as the Minister of State said.  How are we still able to afford incremental pay rises?  According to the CSO figures from last November, the growing pay gap means earnings for public servants are almost €300 a week higher than those in private companies.  Weekly earnings in the public sector now average €906 compared with €617 in the private sector.  Those figures are explicit.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">A county manager who spoke to RTE said he tried to reduce the leave of local authority staff on the basis that "We felt that was consistent with Croke Park" and did not involve compulsory redundancies or reducing pay.  He then went on to say: "It eventually emerged that there was an increase in leave for outdoor staff, no change in leave for the bulk of staff, modest reductions at the very top and, perversely, for those staff for whom the State has decided their leave is too high they are to be compensated for the reduction in their leave by giving them more leave."</p>
          <p eId="para_337">He said there was an attempt to raise hours from a modest 33.25 to just 35, which had been ruled out under Croke Park.  He said they could not advance any reductions in premium pay and the view was that premium pay for staff, such as for overtime and weekend work, rendered them completely uncompetitive.  He said it has been quite frustrating addressing the reform agenda.  He was actively involved in this issue.  It is a damning appraisal from someone on the inside.  How is this a good deal for the consumer and taxpayer?</p>
          <p eId="para_338">In addition, it seems that the coalition's public stance on the agreement may need to change.  A survey of 520 city and county councillors, of whom 317 were from Fine Gael or the Labour Party, shows a desire for change.  In all, 65% or 206 of the Government parties' councillors said the deal should be renegotiated.  The majority of respondents also said the payout of an annual €250 million in bonuses or increments to public sector workers should also be stopped.  A lot of the public may feel the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Jürgen Stark was a top German official in the ECB.  He argued public sector pay in Ireland is too high by eurozone standards and should be cut to help restore order to the country's public finances.  He said that by implementing changes the Irish Government has the chance to surprise the market positively.  In this respect, it is interesting to study Lithuania.  I have become a fan of its economic approach.  It had reached a new low and was in a much worse situation than Ireland when the IMF was called in.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It has come back up very quickly.  It implemented tough measures, such as a reduction in top level public sector salaries of more than 20%.  That, along with other cuts, has seen it become one of Europe's success stories, just as Ireland, it is to be hoped, will be.  It is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe with an annualised growth rate of 6.6%.  When one compares that with Ireland, one realises how well it is doing.  We must take heed of how targeted cuts can result in significant benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We must tackle inefficiencies and consider unpopular measures like cutting public sector salaries.  Lithuania has taken the hard medicine and many believe it is on the road to recovery.  Its growth rate, at least, would point to this.  Too often politicians are worried about re-election and do not want to touch taboo subjects.  The Government must show real courage to further restore our competitiveness and fuel our recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">It is so interesting to listen to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.  She talks about running a business and says when things change in the outside world, the person running the business must also change.  The Minister of State is running this business and things have changed.  The expected growth rates have not materialised and on that basis he must go back to his employees and say we have a challenge on our hands.  A good manager is able to convince the employees that they must make changes.  There are enough examples in the Croke Park agreement that would allow him to say things have changed, we must also change and it would be to all our benefit to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Senator Hayden said we must renegotiate because the lower paid are not paid well enough.  That may be the case but we must renegotiate and see if there is a better deal.  We do not want to end up in the same situation as Greece and we could do that if we do this wrong.  A good manager, a good disciplinarian should be able to convince his employees that we must make certain changes in all our interests.</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_345">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the tone of his speech.  He set out a good context for today's debate and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I also wish to dispel the notion that running public services is the same as running income generating businesses; it is not.  Of course there must be efficiencies but the health service, the Garda Síochána and schools are not income generating businesses and there is a world of difference between running a business and running a school or a hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Senator O'Brien made the point that trade unions represent their members and protect their interests.  Of course they do; their members have taken a significant pay cut of 15% across the board in recent years.  Any more cuts to the disposable income of low to middle income public sector workers will have a dampening effect on our domestic economy so it makes economic sense not to hit low to middle income workers in either the public or private sector at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Minister of State said there is a need to embrace further changes and for Croke Park to be driven on.  I met some of the unions in recent days and the reality is that many of these changes are being embraced by the workers and the unions, who are pushing for these reforms, but much of the resistance comes from management and the Minister of State should reflect on that.  The evidence exists to suggest redeployment, rostering, secondment, creating efficiencies and increased productivity are all happening.  There have been savings of €280 million in payroll costs and €308 million in non-payroll costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">People mentioned the media and I want to read one quotation, which spells out where much of the opposition to the Croke Park agreement is coming from.  On 27 November 2011, Brendan O'Connor wrote in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, and I know we should not take Brendan too seriously:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_350">That is why this story tells us everything we need to know about this Government.  Suddenly we understand why old people will be booted out of their homes, why special needs children will not be allowed to go to school, why hospitals will be shut down, why everything will be sacrificed before they will touch a hair on the head of the public sector pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">That flies in the face of the reality faced by public sector workers.  It is important in this debate that we pay tribute to those public sector workers on the front line providing services and doing more for less up and down the country, in our schools, hospitals and local authorities.  This debate should be about protecting public services, citizens' rights and those who work in our public services who are doing a tremendous job above and beyond the call of duty in the difficult circumstances they face.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I agree with Senator Cullinane; public and civil servants are a much-maligned group of workers.  Their morale is low but they all show up for work every day and put their shoulders to the wheel.  They are down quite an amount of money in the last few months.  There are, however, areas that must be attacked.  I take issue with Senator Byrne's remarks.  Unfortunately I must use the accident and emergency services on a regular basis and they are disorganised.  It is the front line staff, not the Minister for Health.  They are lovely people, they are always very good to us when we are there but there are organisational issues that must be sorted out in accident and emergency departments and we must get on with that job.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I welcome the Minister of State's agreement that we must work within the framework but selected, targeted redundancies must be an issue at some stage and some incremental pay issues must be addressed.  The grade eight structures within the HSE were arrived at under the stewardship of the current leader of Fianna Fáil and Mary Harney, where we came from 18 grade eight employees to over 1,000 such employees.  Those are the areas we must examine.  I do not know if that can be reversed but that is the cause of many of the pay issues we now have.  The HSE was a huge transgressor in that respect.</p>

Will that ultimately lead to a better regional approach to deployment?  Given all the criticism vented in the House today about how the media has handled this debate, would the Minister of State's office run a proper briefing, perhaps over a full day, where some of the achievements of those trying to implement the Croke Park agreement could be outlined?  The Minister of State could give journalists the information on a more intimate basis.  Much of the misunderstanding arises from a lack of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Minister of State himself said he could see forbearance will be pushed to the limit.  Perhaps he could tell us what he will do to reduce that.  He warned about what he sees coming down the tracks.  The statement, if left hanging, could produce even more of these problems with the media.</p>

Both higher level and middle management level inertia and lack of ambition is a problem so has any progress been made there or is there still resistance to change?</p>

These cuts are in education but such cuts are also being made in the health service, local authorities, the Garda and right across the board.  Does the Minister of State agree that the pain is being felt by public sector workers?

          <p eId="para_365">Some 53% of all civil servants are in the lower grades.  One of the concerns that arose regarding the Education (Amendment) Bill was the re-employment of retired teachers and health professionals.  We do not want to see them coming out one door and in another, particularly when there are large numbers of unemployed young teachers and health professionals.  How do we protect against that?</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Caution should be exercised with regard to the substantial cancellation of increments for teachers with additional qualifications because international research demonstrates that the implications for the teaching system generally of not incentivising teachers to obtain higher qualifications can be very damaging to the education sector.  Would the Minister reconsider this move on the basis that reversing it would not be particularly costly?</p>

          <p eId="para_367">Does the Minister of State agree that the reduction of numbers has very little to do with the Croke Park agreement because it was already in train?  Does he agree that unless there is a radical reduction in the cost of public service pay and pensions, we will find it impossible to extricate ourselves from our financial difficulty?  In 2000, public service pay and pensions cost €8.6 billion.  Ten years later, the gross cost was €18.6 billion, which is not sustainable.  Does the Minister of State agree that the €3.5 billion referred to as a saving will effectively be halved because of the pensions worth €1.75 billion?  Does he agree the tax foregone on the other half will reduce the figure to €850 million?  The saving is, therefore, only 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Does the Minister of State agree with Senator Sheahan that numbers could be reduced by 20% — this is exactly the figure I got from senior and middle management — if only they could remove those who are not performing, and that this would improve productivity?  This is surely what we should be doing in the current crisis rather than imposing cuts on people with disabilities and on social welfare.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I will do my best.  This has been a most interesting and useful debate, regardless on one's perspective on the Croke Park agreement.  It has been a very useful exercise and I genuinely thank all the contributors.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The public sector is not big by international standards.  Those in many European countries are much bigger.  We are engaging in very substantial change.  Approximately 12% in total will be taken out.  I concede that, in the good years, public pay was ramped up at an unsustainable level.  In the period 2000 to 2010, public pay virtually doubled.  In Germany, it rose by approximately 15%, thereby demonstrating the problem.   There were ridiculous benchmarking exercises where double-digit growth in public sector pay was allowed allegedly to deal with the disparity in wages.  We are dealing with that fundamental mistake, a political mistake in which unions were bought off and on foot of which no substantial efficiencies were delivered.  A merry-go-round was established which is now at an end.  We must now move on from that appalling political legacy and do so in partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Senator O'Brien and others asked me what occurs if there is no money.  If it is not available, it is not available and we will have to change accordingly.  I remarked earlier this year that the question of increments is fundamental.  I said quite bluntly to the public sector unions, as did other Ministers, that we want genuine buy-in and support for the very radical sectoral plans that we want to get over the line in the early period of 2012.  These plans will make a difference regarding rostering, premium payments and a host of other areas.  This is the kind of buy-in we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I was asked about the transitional teams in health, education, local government, justice, defence and the Civil Service.  Since the autumn, we have been working on these teams.  They have been putting together plans because they have recognised that, between 1 January and the end of February this year, very substantial numbers of people will leave the public sector.  There are many opportunities for young people who will suddenly be employed in the public sector.  Many young teachers will get jobs this year who would not get them otherwise because staff in their early 60s and late 50s have decided to leave early.  The young teachers will be entering the public service on a different pay scale and will be replacing staff at the top of their pay scales.  This will result in substantial savings and a considerable opportunity for schools.  Many highly educated and motivated staff will be coming into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">We will be getting rid of approximately 9,000 staff but, because of the gaps in the front line, approximately 3,000 additional appointments will be made in specialist areas.  Most of the appointees will be young.  They will be getting opportunities and filling in gaps, and they will have a motivational effect.  The transition teams are in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_384">We can have a game of semantics or a genuine debate on what is happening.  What is happening is that since last autumn, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the sectoral teams, we have been working on plans.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be submitting a report to the Cabinet next week setting out their extent.  The plan in question was initiated by the former Government, which set the date.  Effectively, public servants were allowed to make a decision up to a very late date and, consequently, the number leaving was not actually clear.  We must deal with this.  We pay managers a lot of money to manage.  It is not the task of politicians in Leinster House to micro-manage sections of the public service across the country.  These people are paid good money to manage and it is their task to do so.   We see very good examples of such management in hospitals.  Speakers mentioned the accident and emergency wards.  Why is it that we have very good practices in some of those wards but not in others?  The reason is good managers who decide to take responsibility, who put it up to the staff and lead.  It is not a deficiency of front-line staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">If I am honest, what I have seen is a lack of management throughout the public sector.  There are probably too many managers.  One of the great aspects of social partnership was the explosion of the managerial class within the public sector, reporting to nobody, taking no responsibility, having no aspect of project management.  That is what we must weed out and thereby ensure that if people are paid well to manage they will manage the nurses, doctors, teachers and those who operate within the local government system.  That is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I stated that the increments issue might come up again if we do not get reforms over the line.  I have made that very clear and I stand by that position.  To take up from what Senator O'Keeffe observed, that is the sting in the tail.  We have an international agreement and this is part of the memorandum of understanding, as Senator Sheahan noted.  We have a deal here with our external funders.  This could all be on the agenda again if we do not have the money.  If a new external shock were to come into the foreground it would produce a response.  We hope that does not happen because we want to work with the public sector in making sure we get these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">However, I cannot predict the future.  I do not know what will happen in six weeks, never mind six months, given the scale of the international crisis we face.  We have managed it pretty well so far but there will be difficulties.  Let us be blunt.  Taking 40,000 people out of the system is a dirty way of doing what is required but I am not convinced there is another way to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I am not convinced that one can micro-manage a system.  I appreciate what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said because she employs 100 people.  However, it is slightly more complex in the public sector, which has 300,000 people and 150 grades, where there are people at professional levels and others coming into service on a contract basis, where people provide services for others who are utterly stressed because they cannot find work in this country.  It is a slightly different set-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">There may have been a view that we could achieve all this by selectively moving personnel and thereby reduce numbers by 40,000.  Such a view is not genuinely honest about how the world works.  What has happened has been very difficult.  I heard the comments of Eddie Molloy, a much respected expert in the area of public administration and he said it was dirty but there was no other way of doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">As for those who have been putting forward alternatives — how real are they?  We will see a radically different public service but the whole objective is to keep the front line in place while altering the back office staff.  There will be fundamental change for people as we do that but we have the capacity within the Croke Park agreement to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I apologise.  I wish to say this because it is important for colleagues to hear it.  In 2008 the total public sector pay and pension bill was just short of €20 billion, with €17 billion in pay and €2.3 billion on pensions.  By 2015 under our estimation, the pay bill will have gone down from €17 billion to €14 billion while the pensions bill will have gone up from €2.3 billion to €3 billion.  When one factors in the pension levy on top of that there are savings of €3.6 billion.  In 2008, therefore, we were paying €2.3 billion on pensions while by 2015 we will be paying €3 billion.  The increase is of €700 million but the actual pay reduction will go down from €17 billion to €14.3 billion, in a seven year period and in a circumstance where inflation is back in the economy.  Is there any business, the Senator's included, which could produce that, when the country has been put into receivership?</p>
          <p eId="para_394">That is what the Croke Park agreement is and people need to understand that.  They should not mind the inflated headlines they see in the newspapers.  Those are the facts of the situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_398">I thank the Leader for the extra time.  The point was not picked up in the speeches of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the Dáil that our task in 2012 and 2013 is to reduce overtime payments.  I believe the figure is 10% for those years.  It is a little known fact.  People will be working longer and harder because of the extra case loads and there will be fewer colleagues around to help but they will not receive the same overtime pay as they did in the past.  It is not only a reduction in core pay we have seen from 2008 to 2012 but also a reduction in overtime.  That will be very difficult to achieve.  How many people in the private sector can achieve that?</p>
          <p eId="para_399">My friend, Senator Quinn, rightly asked if we have too many county managers in Dublin.  That is an issue for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in the first instance, and I know he is looking at it.  One difference we have made is to set a very significant cap of €200,000 for the elite, the praetorian guard of the Irish public sector.  That is the maximum figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I listened closely to what some colleagues observed in the argument on increments, and whether people who earn more than €60,000 should be entitled to receive them, given they are in a totally different financial category to the great majority of public servants, who as Senator Hayden pointed out, earn €20,000 to €30,000 and are mostly women.  That is a fundamental question and it can be genuinely asked.  It is bandied around that we could save €320 million tomorrow by simply getting rid of all increments.  Once again, however, that is not true.  It is estimated that no more than €180 million per annum, with less than half that sum in 2012, could be saved by getting rid of increments, 70% of which go to people who earn less than €30,000 and live on very small pay.  Whatever about the argument for getting rid of increments for people in a different income category, for the great majority of public servants these are, frankly, pretty small beer in terms of their public pay position.  I reiterate, we are reviewing special allowances and have introduced a comprehensive audit of allowances in respect of additional non-core pay that may come into the foreground.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I apologise if I have not answered all questions.  It is a difficult task and I am learning it.  I have one final point, which picks up on what Senator O'Keeffe observed.  I have been in this job for about 11 months.  One of the things that most fascinates me, working with the Irish public service, is its failure to embrace and explain to the public the enormous successes it has achieved in appalling financial circumstances.  I offer one example.  Road deaths and road carnage in this country have fallen dramatically as a result of changes in the law made in this House and the other House, but also as a result of An Garda Síochána and the Road Safety Authority.  What greater success could any country have than to say it has managed to reduce road deaths?  This was brought about by a compliant public but also by a dedicated public service that worked together to achieve that result, following the laws of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">In my own area of procurement we have introduced savings.  The private sector rightly sets out what it achieves but there seems to be an inherent problem in the Irish public sector about taking ownership and control of the wonderful things it has achieved.  These are the most motivated people in the Irish public sector, across the system, who are sometimes frustrated and want to achieve other things.  However, we must find a way of explaining to the public the enormous achievements of these people, on our behalf, as legislators and policy makers.  Since coming to this job, I have been struck by this failure to communicate in simple ways about the achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">At the outset I mentioned how we had redeployed staff across the public sector.  That has been achieved without protest or megaphone diplomacy but in a nice, quiet and deliberate way through moving people around and getting them to buy into redeployment.  The public sector has gone about this work in a quiet and deliberate way but it will need support to get through even more difficult stages.  If we have learned anything from the crisis over the past several years, it is that we know we need a public service at its best.  In the crisis, there was a failure politically on which the public had its say but there was also a failure of public administration.  That can never be allowed to happen again.  This country can never again be in the position into which it has been forced in recent years.  A way out of that is to motivate the public sector to ensure we get the best out of its workers who are genuinely publicly spirited and want to achieve for their country and their children.  The Government will also ensure the type of reform implemented will make a difference.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_404">I thank the Senators for their interest in these important immigration initiatives and I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the new programmes and their potential value to the economy and the immigration system.  These programmes have been under development for some time within the Department of Justice and Equality and have been the subject of wide consultation among Departments, State agencies and Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">These new programmes are imaginative, build on the flexibility of our immigration system and have the capacity to deliver badly needed investment to our fragile economy.  Nobody should be in any doubt whatsoever about the ultimate objective of these programmes.  To put it simply, it is jobs.  I mean by that both the protection of existing jobs and, equally, the development of new opportunities.  I am glad to able to use our immigration system in a way that can contribute to achieving that overriding objective and to the objective outlined by the Taoiseach of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Before I go into the details of the two new programmes, it would be appropriate to place them in the context of overall Irish immigration policy and the recent developments that have taken place.  A look at some of the recent statistics is illuminating.  Overall in 2011, approximately 164,000 new applications for visas, residence, protection and citizenship were received by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, the area of my Department with responsibility for immigration in Ireland.  Decisions were issued by INIS in almost 178,000 cases, including a proportion of decisions relating to applications submitted in previous years.  Over 111,000 new or renewed registrations of permission to remain in the State were issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Provisional figures indicate that approximately 83,000 entry visa applications were processed in 2011, an increase of 8% on 2010.  The approval rate for entry visa applications was 91%.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Tourism Ireland has also reported a significant increase in tourist numbers from the new target markets and the number of tourist groups from China more than doubled from July to August 2011 compared to the same period last year.   Additionally, a number of Indian and Gulf tour operators have added Ireland to their European itineraries for the first time.  The number of non-EEA national students registered to study in the State is approximately 32,500 or 25% of the total number of non-EEA nationals with permission to remain in the State.  Broken down by education sector, 37% of students are pursuing higher education — degree programme — study, 29% are taking language courses, 23% further education — non-degree programme — courses and 11% are taking other courses, such as accountancy, or attending secondary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">These statistics reveal an encouraging perception of Ireland as a desirable destination for tourism, study, residence or to do business.  I believe there is considerable scope within the immigration field to contribute to our national recovery through targeted and well managed policies that capitalise on the potential benefits while minimising the possible downsides.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">A key initiative already taken is the Irish short-stay visa waiver programme with the UK, which commenced on 1 July 2011, and will run as a pilot until 31 October 2012.  Based on the success of the scheme I expect that it will be extended into the future.  The programme is designed to boost tourism and business, especially from emerging markets.  Extrapolated visa data from the regions in which the waiver programme operates indicate that visitor numbers from the countries concerned significantly increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">At the other end of the immigration journey is the hugely successful citizenship ceremony which for the first time ever marks the grant of citizenship with an occasion befitting its importance to the recipient and to us as the host nation.  I have argued for the instigation of such ceremonies for many years and I am particularly pleased that within weeks of my appointment as Minister I was in a position to host the first of these great ceremonies in Dublin Castle.  Over the course of two days last week, in Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines, more than 2,250 candidates for citizenship from 110 countries across five continents were formally welcomed as citizens of Ireland.  It was a proud and moving moment for everybody involved and these ceremonies are also in their own way helping to restore our sense of what is good about being Irish.  The pride of those new citizens in their Irishness was clearly visible in their faces as they stood proudly facing the tricolour during the playing of our national anthem by the Army Band.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Citizenship has been always a particular priority of mine.  On taking up office, I immediately initiated steps within my Department to deal with the huge backlog of citizenship applications.  More than 16,000 applications were dealt with in 2011, more than double the number dealt with in 2010.  Since the start of this year I have made determinations on almost 3,000 applications.  It is expected that the current backlog will be substantially dealt with in the next couple of months, after which the objective is that, save in exceptional circumstances, persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">On 24 January I announced that the Government had approved two new proposals which I had brought to the Cabinet table and which are designed to stimulate investment and enterprise in Ireland by suitable qualified foreign nationals.  Of course, as I said at the outset, the scheme is designed to protect and create employment as overriding objectives.  I take this opportunity to emphatically refute any suggestions that these new programmes are a return of the discredited so-called passports-for-sale scheme in a different guise.  Any suggestions to this effect are completely wide of the mark and anybody who takes the trouble to read about the programmes and the conditions attaching to them will establish that very quickly.  It is straightforward.  The programmes have been designed to facilitate legal residence in Ireland for persons who have the potential to contribute to our economy through appropriate investments and enterprise proposals.  The objective will be to select only those proposals that will be of economic benefit to the State.  Successful applicants will be able to apply for citizenship only under the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, in the same way and under the same terms as all other non-Irish nationals residing in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I will now outline the criteria for both programmes.  The immigrant investor programme is designed to attract individuals with a proven record of success in business and enterprise, and offer an opportunity to invest in and relocate to the State.  A range of investment options are provided for, with different thresholds applied depending on the nature of the investment as follows.  There can be a once off endowment of a minimum of €500,000 to a project with a clear public benefit in areas such as arts, sports or education.  The endowment will not provide any return for the investor nor will it be recoupable.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">There can be minimum €2 million investment in the designated Irish Government immigrant investor bond.  The investment is to be held for a minimum of five years.  My officials are currently negotiating with the National Treasury Management Agency on the development of a suitable low-interest investment product.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">There can be venture capital funding of a minimum of €1 million into an Irish business for a minimum of three years.  An investment into an Irish publicly quoted company could be considered but the investment level in that context might need to be higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There can be a mixed investment of a minimum of €1 million with 50% in property and 50% in Government securities.  Special consideration could be given to those purchasing properties in the State, which have been enforced by NAMA.  In such cases a single €1 million investment in property might be sufficient.  There is a clear public interest in NAMA being able to realise assets that have now been vested in it in circumstances in which persons who use those assets to secure loans are no longer capable of meeting their obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">As the second leg of the proposed programme, the start-up visa programme recognises the need to foster start-up enterprises in priority innovation sectors of the economy.  The existing business permission scheme is insufficient to support such business proposals and a more flexible approach has been developed in consultation with Enterprise Ireland, which has extensive experience of such schemes in other jurisdictions.  To qualify an applicant must have some form of financial backing of not less that €75,000 through business angels, venture capital providers or a financial institution regulated by the Financial Regulator — personal funding transferred to the State or a grant from a relevant State agency might be also acceptable; the applicant must not be a drain on public funds; and, most importantly, the business must have a strong innovation component.  This will be assessed by the evaluation committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Applications for both programmes will be on a prescribed form and will be accompanied by a fee to offset the costs of administering the schemes and to deter frivolous applications.  Candidates will be also required to submit a comprehensive business plan detailing their planned investments and to provide evidence of sufficient funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Both programmes will be subject to the approval of an evaluation committee composed of suitably qualified and experienced people from relevant Departments and State agencies.  The evaluation committee will be the key to the assessment process and it demonstrates a joined-up Government approach to capitalise on the expertise that exists in the wider public service.  As well as from my Department, the evaluation committee will consist of representation from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The committee will be also able to call on expertise from the wider public service should the need arise in evaluating proposals which, for example, relate to the educational, health or tourism areas.  For example, if a proposal is made in the area of the provision of health-care facilities, an appropriate expert from the Department of Health would join the committee to assess the application and ensure it is fully and properly evaluated.  The purpose of the committee will be to adjudicate on the legitimacy of the candidate and his or her investment as well as the viability of the business proposal.  The first job of the committee will be to adopt and publish a code of practice which will underpin the integrity of the process and ensure the schemes operate in an open and transparent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Successful applicants ordinarily will be granted residence permission for five years, which will be reviewed after two years to ensure the original investment remains in place and that the general terms on which the permission was granted continue to be met.  Family reunification will be permitted for spouses, partners and children provided that family needs are met from the resources of the entrepreneur or investor, or other private means.  No access to State benefits will be permitted during this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The evaluation process goes well beyond just looking at the investment.  International best practice will be followed.  Normal security checks will be applied, including international police co-operation.  The participants must be of good repute and must be also able to satisfy the immigration authorities as to the provenance or origins of their funds.  The applicant will be required to swear an affidavit attesting to character and the source of his or her funds.  It will be made clear that false statements will void any permission granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The initiatives we are implementing are not unique internationally.  There is significant competition among migrant destination states to attract migrant investors and entrepreneurs.  Many are motivated by the experience of Canada, where there was a significant influx of wealthy people of Chinese origin from Hong Kong in the early and mid-1990s before the hand-over of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China.  Today, countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have sophisticated schemes in place to attract the interest of investors and entrepreneurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">An overseas investor who acquires an Irish centre of interest can make an economic contribution far above and beyond his or her initial investment.  If such persons move to Ireland, transfer their wealth and relocate business interests, the potential benefit is considerable.  It also brings intellectual capital and business acumen.  In addition where a number of investors come from the same country this in itself can create an investment and business community with links to their country of origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Work is under way in my Department on the implementation of the two programmes.  I intend to launch the programme formally in mid-March at which time appropriate guidelines and application forms will be available.  I expect that applications will be accepted shortly thereafter.  It is not possible at present to gauge the possible interest in both programmes and I will offer no hostages to fortune in this regard but I remain optimistic for their potential.  Since the initial announcement made with regard to the programmes, inquiries have already been made to my Department about the exact start up date and seeking details of them.  We will continue to meet and engage in dialogue with individuals who may have the resources to locate in Ireland in the context of the programme being proposed to the benefit of people who reside here in the context of the possibility of providing jobs or engaging in innovative business programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In putting together these programmes I have made reference to the extensive discussions that took place.  At the early stages we engaged in discussions with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, the National Treasury Management Agency and NAMA.  All of these bodies envisage substantial benefits to the State by these programmes being put in place and up and running.  I am very optimistic about the impact they will have in the coming 12 months or two years.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Senator Paschal Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_427">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  In my long association with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, I have come to know his style and this initiative has the stamp of his inventive thinking all over it.  I applaud the Minister for hitting the ground running in this regard.  As the Minister suggested, our recent history has been littered with similar attempts to attract entrepreneurs to the country.  For a variety of reasons, these have tended to end up being not quite what was originally suggested or not quite in line with the original ambitions.  The Minister has focused well on two areas which will be very helpful to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I was taken by the Minister's recent remarks around Holocaust Day.  He took the opportunity to give the context in which this country's record for encouraging immigrants to the country left a good deal to be desired, especially in respect of the Jewish population pre-war who sought to get out of Nazi Germany at the time.  I do not suggest the record was shameful but many moral questions arise about the attitude of Irish bureaucracy and the Irish State at the time.  The Minister will agree that this was not helped by the anti-Semitic Irish ambassador to Nazi Germany at the time who fed back a good deal of negative information.  Perhaps, taking account of the long view, the decisions taken at that time had some validity but I find it difficult to see that and I believe the Minister holds the same view.  I have often thought that if the unfortunate Jewish people who were fleeing Nazi Germany had come to this country or had been allowed to come to this country it would have helped to build a strong entrepreneurial base here, such as happened in other countries.  The Minister made reference to the reintegration of Hong Kong into China.  We failed to take advantage of that initiative at the time while others countries did so and, in a sense, we are playing catch-up now.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I applaud the Minister on his initiative in respect of the visa waiver programme as it applies to those coming from the Far East.  At a recent meeting of the economic committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London we received a presentation from the equivalent of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, in the North.  It raised the issue of those who were visiting Ireland on Chinese visas but who could not access Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is putting forward some extraordinary tourist attractions this year.  Titanic Belfast is one major event and Derry as the UK city of culture is another.  I appreciate the Minister has addressed this to a large degree and that those coming from the 15 designated countries who receive a UK visa will be allowed to travel on to Ireland.  I assume these people also have access to the North.  However, the speaker raised the issue of people who were given specific visas for Ireland.  I realise the Minister is aware of this and perhaps he may be able to address it.  We are promoting Irish tourism on an all-island basis and if people come to this part of the island, I see no reason some accommodation cannot be made for them to visit the northern part.  I have no wish to take up too much more of the time allocated to me other than to make that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Prior to his elevation to ministerial office, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and I held several meetings with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to try to encourage the State agencies to encourage more venture capitalists, especially those from the Jewish diaspora, to come here.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I understand that the most successful venture capitalists in the world are among the Jewish diaspora and are based primarily in the United States.  There is a good deal of merit in what the Minister was attempting to do.  I fully supported him on that initiative.  I wonder whether this initiative stems from that thinking because the Minister is engaging with the various State agencies including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in a similar way.  Is there some sub-text here?  Will there be an opportunity for those potential venture capitalists to be encouraged to come here and establish businesses to provide much-needed jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Minister makes reference to the fact that he will be calling on a great deal of expertise.  However, I note that this expertise appears to be confined to the public service.  I have the highest regard for those in IDA Ireland and others in the public service.  One need only examine the evidence of the past year.  They created 13,500 new jobs.  Admittedly, there was a reduction of 6,000 jobs but there was a net gain of 7,500 jobs at a time of severe economic disadvantage.  I applaud the ongoing efforts of the State agencies in attracting foreign direct investment to the country.  They will play a central role as per the Minister's presentation.  However, will the Minister consider taking in outside business expertise in the evaluation committee?  I have in mind successful entrepreneurs in this country.  I have no wish to name names but we all know who they are.  These people have established, created and expanded multinational companies which compete with the very best in the world.  There are several Irish-based business people who are patriotic, who pay their taxes in the country, who live in the country and who could provide considerable expertise on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.  The Minister stated he would employ further expertise available to him, presumably from with the public service.  I put on record names such as Denis O’Brien, Michael O’Leary and Sir Anthony O’Reilly.  These are three possible names who come to mind off the top of my head.  Overall this is a wonderful scheme.  I have no doubt we will have an opportunity to debate the matter further.  It is vital that the House has had the opportunity to hear the Minister outline his initial comments and to elaborate a little on the schemes.  I presume the Minister has built in a monitoring and evaluation system to ensure the initiative is successful.  I commend the Minister on the proposal and I wish him well in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Senator Paul Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I welcome the Minister and thank him for his interesting presentation.  I thank the previous speaker, Senator Mooney, for his generous response to the Minister's proposal.  It is good that in the case of such an important matter all sides of the House can sing from the one hymn sheet.  In recent years and in the course of recent months since the new Government took over I have commented that every Department and Government proposal should be job-proofed, irrespective of which legislation we are attempting to introduce.  Every measure should contribute in some way to the urgent need for job creation and this measure is a great plus in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Normally, we would not expect the Minister for Justice and Equality to come before us with measures designed to put people back to work and to get the economy up and running.  The Minister's initiative is most welcome.  Clearly, he has put a good deal of thought and serious intellectual capital into his presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I agree with the Minister's comments on the previous passports for sale scheme.  The Minister described it as discredited and it is fair to say as much.  However, perhaps at the instigation of that scheme there were good ideas and proposals.  It was not a complete disaster.  Nevertheless, we needed a new variation on the scheme and the Minister is presenting an exciting twin-track approach.  I look forward to the final details and the application forms being available.  I expect there will be significant international interest in what the Minister proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The previous speaker mentioned what should have happened in the past in the context of a particular international community.  Looking at the State of Israel today, we can see how the people of Israel have benefited from their constant communication with the Jewish community worldwide.  Significant investment into the State of Israel comes on a daily basis from the broader Jewish diaspora and the state probably could not survive without it.  We can learn a lot from that in the context of the tens of millions of people throughout the world who, while they may not be Irish and whose parents and grandparents may not be Irish, have historical links with Ireland.  That market is there to be tapped and, hopefully, many of those people will be interested in this programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Chinese angle has been mentioned by the Minister and the previous speaker.  We must recognise that over the next number of decades the balance of the world's economic development will relate in some way to China.  We must try to take advantage of that and seek investment from that state.  In that regard, one of my colleagues, Senator Healy Eames, who cannot be here for this debate because she has to attend a conference, wanted to record her strong support for this proposal and her concern that we need to work harder and faster on the processing of visas for business visitors to Ireland.  She mentioned that she has organised a conference in Galway on 23 March with Chinese business people coming to Galway and Ireland to examine trade and industry links with Ireland and asked me to stress here the difficulty that exists with regard to processing visas for this type of visit quickly enough.  She is concerned there is significant delay and feels this needs to be addressed where bilateral investment opportunities are available.  I support her in the effort to ensure the visa processing system is improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Minister has made tremendous progress on the issue of citizenship applications and in removing the backlog.  However, it can still take some time in some of our Irish embassies worldwide to process entry visas for Ireland.  One of my colleagues told me that if someone, for example, wanted to go to Australia in a week's time, that person could go to a travel agency, book a flight and have a visa application processed there and then, all within ten or 15 minutes.  However, where an Australian person wants to come to Ireland for a business visit or whatever, it can sometimes take days or weeks to have the visa processed.  We need to make progress in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">There will be significant interest in the immigrant investor programme and the Minister has outlined some of the areas into which he would he would expect to see benefits flow.  We should try to make a particular effort to attract interest in natural industries we want to promote, such as alternative energy, wind farms, forestry, etc.  We would be in a win-win situation if we could get outside investment into those areas as they require urgent investment.  The minimum limits set by the Minister are realistic because we need to send out the message that we are talking about serious investment and investors rather than fly-by-night operators.  The limits and targets set are helpful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">On the possibility of whether many of these people will move from five-year residency to longer-term citizenship, I hope that transpires to be the case.  We must accept that the majority of people who would like to invest in our country would, at some stage, wish to become long-term residents, if not citizens.  That route will be available after the normal five-year period and I welcome that.  I will leave it at that as I have nothing further novel to say.  This is a welcome and worthwhile measure and shows thinking outside the normal political box.  I welcome that.  If the country needs anything, it needs jobs, job creation and enterprise and this initiative will be a help in that regard.  I wish the Minister well with the project.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Senator Terry Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_440">I compliment the Minister on this initiative and would like him to outline whether legislation or regulation is required for it.  It is an excellent initiative and an interesting programme.  Members may be aware that in the past we had a "passports for sale" initiative and while that was a much maligned scheme, it created a significant number of jobs for this country.  One need only look at Kerry Airport, Millstreet and the significant afforestation projects to see some of the benefits from that scheme.  The scheme was much maligned by people who were in good jobs who did not have to worry about getting employment.  However, based on my knowledge of the scheme, I could supply a list of companies here that would not be operating now and providing employment but for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This scheme as envisaged is in a sense a further innovation of that one and will, probably, be easier to sell.  I see it as a move in the right direction.  Some countries have a scheme whereby if a person buys a property or one of the surplus houses available and thereby takes a stake in the community and if the person has adequate means, this will qualify the person for naturalisation.  This would be an attraction for some people and perhaps some of the houses on housing estates around the country that have not been sold could be a possible investment and the first step for people who have not got naturalisation.  Investment in Government bonds or in the national reconstruction bond scheme would also be an excellent idea.  All in all, this is the type of initiative that must be taken in times of difficulty in order to create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Canada has a scheme which is even more blunt than that proposed by the Minister.  Its passport scheme allows that where a person can make the necessary investment in the country, he or she will be given the option to apply for a passport on the basis that the person is creating jobs and making a long-term investment and intends to reside in the country.  The Minister is aware from his Department's files of the interesting schemes and applications that have come to his Department prior to his becoming Minister, going back to the time of Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and others.  The file on those applications is fascinating and when the Minister has time, he should read it.  It should be very illuminating to discover the number of projects that have been funded in this regard.  The "passport for sale" scheme got great support and there are thousands of acres of afforestation owned under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I hope the Minister moves on this initiative as quickly as possible.  The start-up entrepreneur programme is imaginative and progressive and it is interesting that it is being promoted by this Minister's Department.  It is important that every Department looks at how it can help to create jobs.  This Minister is not the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, but he is using his Department to open up a way to create jobs.  Well done, I wish the initiative well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik</from>
          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this programme.  It is great that Members on both sides of the House welcome this  initiative which we all recognise as a good idea.  As Senator Bradford said, it will be good for job creation and is an example of Ministers thinking outside the box and thinking laterally about how a Department where job creation proposals are not usually forthcoming can take an initiative that will, hopefully, have a beneficial impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">It is important to recognise the immensely positive contribution that inward migration has already had in Ireland and to celebrate that positive impact.  I have previously put on the record of this House my family experience, as my grandfather came to Ireland in 1946 as a refugee from communism in Czechoslovakia, having previously been imprisoned by the Nazis.  He had been in the Czech resistance and the communists were also very against those fighters.  He set up Waterford Glass after the war in Ireland, thereby bringing about a great deal of jobs, investment and trade in Ireland.  It is a good example of the sort of contribution that migrants have made to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Around the South Circular Road in Dublin where I live there are thriving local businesses, many run by some of the new communities in our very multicultural area.  It is important to note that the Minister has sent out very positive signals about immigration and I commend him on those wonderful citizenship ceremonies he initiated.  All of us found those photographs in the newspapers depicting families and children very proud of their new Irish citizenship last weekend extremely uplifting; it made us all feel better about this country in a difficult economic time.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">With regard to immigration policy, the visa waiver programme is very important and I hope there will be a beneficial impact from people visiting London this summer for the Olympics and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens.  Cultural tourism in Ireland is also important, as we can bring people here on short-term visas for cultural and literary heritage reasons rather than pure tourism.  Senator Mooney noted how Belfast has used anniversaries effectively, such as the sailing of the <i>Titanic</i>.  We must encourage people to come here to celebrate heritage as well as other reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I was struck by a comment from Senator Quinn yesterday, which is relevant to this debate.  He spoke of the US model in which members of the diaspora are invited to invest in small start-up companies, and it struck me that as part of the immigrant investor programme we should make available opportunities to Irish-Americans and people resident in the US who may be interested in this sort of investment.  We could provide a list of Irish start-ups which could benefit particularly from inward investment.  In other words we could try to link technology companies such as those producing computer games — young firms that need investment — to members of the diaspora who would be interested in investing under this programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I am glad this programme will be launched very shortly, in mid March, and it will be operational soon thereafter.  It is a twin track approach to ensure we facilitate residency both for those making inward investment and those we described as start-up entrepreneurs, or people with an entrepreneurial imagination.  The threshold is lower for them at €75,000.  The current business permission scheme for migrant investors has been seen as inadequate.  Is that because the set criteria are too onerous, with the requirement that people create at least two full-time jobs for EEA nationals and a minimum €300,000 to invest?  Have we learned from that, and is that the reason the different criteria have been set out for this twin track new scheme of immigrant investors and start-up entrepreneurs?  My supposition is that the start-up entrepreneur scheme would prove the more popular.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Could we see some move made in that programme to allow persons living here already to apply but whose residency status may not be sufficiently secure for them to feel they can really grow a business?  I am thinking about the many businesses I mentioned around my area, and many of the people running them may not have very secure residency status.  Will they be eligible to apply in mid March as start-up entrepreneurs or is it designed purely to attract people who are not already resident in Ireland?  It might be useful for people to be able to convert student visas or short-stay visas in order to take advantage of the programme and thereby grow the business in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Minister has helpfully set out the residency requirement and will allow family reunification, which is extremely welcome.  For my grandfather coming here in 1946, it was an important consideration that family reunification would be permitted.  Could it be more flexible and not relate just to spouse, partner or partner and children?  Perhaps it could also apply to grandparents.  All of us have had representations from people in a position where they need a grandparent to free them up by providing child or home care.  People can then continue to run a business or start an entrepreneurial scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Minister has been, correctly, reticent in predicting the numbers of people who will take up the programme.  Has he any indications from any trade missions abroad?  He spoke about already having queries into the Department.  Is there any sign of where we will see particular interest and in what areas that interest will be?  I welcome the scheme and thank the Minister for coming here to introduce it.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyMulcahy" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Senator Tony Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I warmly welcome this creative thinking and it is certainly the way forward.  This is exactly the type of thought process we need.  There was another proposal included in the Finance Bill which will be of great benefit to the country, the new tax regime for foreign investors.  They will pay tax on between €75,000 and €500,000 at a rate of 30%.  I heard a colleague in the Opposition criticise this last night, which shows the inertia between the two ears of some of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">If we are to get more people on this island to create jobs in order to collect tax from them, the only way of doing so is to make it attractive financially.  What plans are there to communicate this scheme and get it to the world market?  I have already circulated details to friends in the UK and I have no doubt they have been passed on to people in the US.  The Shannon Chamber, which deals with much foreign direct investment in the Shannon region, will communicate details to associates, mainly in the United States.  We must circulate this idea far and wide.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I could not welcome this more as it is the way forward for the country.  There is no question or doubt in my mind that this is the way we must think.  I have no doubt it will be of benefit to us.  As Senators Bradford and Bacik noted, it is great to see an initiative like this come from the Minister for Justice and Equality, and I hope the other Ministers consider their briefs and do some creative thinking.  It is a welcome idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">As has been noted, this is an innovative scheme.  In my area in Donegal I work with members of the Indian community who are involved in the software business with a large international company.  Many of those people have contacts within India and I am sure some of those people would love to come to live in Ireland.  Their education system, particularly relating to computers and software, is ten or 15 years ahead of our system, and we could have people from that region setting up businesses in Ireland.  Many Indian people living in Ireland come from the Kerala region, which is noted for its health care professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I am dealing with a local company in Donegal that wants to develop a medical product, and its only avenue is through India.  It needs Indian investment to bring the product to the next level, and we have spoken to Enterprise Ireland and the Minister.  This will open up an opportunity for these people to go to India with their package and ask for investment in a product that could be manufactured in Ireland and sold worldwide.  The finance aspect is important, and I look forward to bringing this news so they can have the potential to develop their product, which could bring jobs to Donegal.</p>

Some of the nurses we recruited from the Philippines five or six years ago are also applying for citizenship.  I acknowledge the efforts made to expedite their applications but I have been contacted by several individuals who are thinking about going to Canada because they have been waiting too long for their applications to be processed.  Can the processing of citizenship applications be expedited for those who work in key areas such as nursing and medicine?  I recognise it may not be possible to do so given the volume of applications that must be processed but the health service is facing staff shortages.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I welcome the Minister's initiative in regard to the investor programme and wish him every success with it.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_466">The time allotted for this debate seemed to pass very quickly.  I thank all the Senators who contributed and thank all sides of the House for the substantial support shown for the scheme.  I was interested and amused by what I would put in tabloid terms as the shock and horror that the Department of Justice and Equality has an idea to create jobs.  The truth is that there is a great deal of innovative thinking in my Department.  It is not all by me and I thank my officials for the substantial work they have done in bringing together this scheme and for the consultative process in which they engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I thank Senator Mooney for his contribution.  I will not go back to the 1930s issue which I discussed previously but I thank him for the comments he made on that.  We have much to learn from the manner in which we have in the past treated individuals in genuine personal difficulties who were trying to come to this country.  I hope the mistakes made in the past will not be repeated in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">In the context of the issue before us, we missed out on substantial opportunities.  This scheme is not aimed at any particular national or religious grouping but if one looks at the areas of venture capital and innovation across the world and the individuals who have contributed substantially to economic development, there is a disproportionate number of people whose Jewish families emerged out of the ashes of the Second World War or who managed to escape from the European continent before 1939 and founded major businesses in the United States.  If one looks at, for example, the Israeli State, there are more patents registered annually in respect of innovations in the State of Israel than in any other country in the world, save the United States, which is extraordinary having regard to the population there.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">These schemes are designed to attract people who are innovators, such as young people coming out of college who may have a good idea and can get financial backing but are resident outside the European Union and would like to come here.  The €75,000 financial back-up entrepreneur scheme gives people an opportunity to innovate in Ireland and to locate here.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Senator Bacik raised the question of what happens if somebody already here on a student visa which is about to expire has an innovative idea.  Such an individual can be accommodated within the scheme provided he or she has the financial backing required.  There is no reason that should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">We substantially lost out prior to the Chinese republic assuming sovereignty over Hong Kong.  A significant number of innovative people left Hong Kong and many went to Australia, New Zealand or the United States.  I visited Hong Kong one year before the Chinese republic took over.  I had views about what we might have done in this country to attract people who were clearly intent on leaving but, unfortunately, not much happened on the issue at that time.  It was one of the issues I had in the back of my mind upon becoming Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The evaluation committee, as Senator Mooney rightly noted, essentially involves the public sector but it will have a capacity to call for assistance from identifiable individuals to evaluate a project where the expertise does not exist within the public sector.  I expect that will happen.  There will be a degree of flexibility and if an unusual project is presented which the committee is unable to properly evaluate we will have to be flexible in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">Obviously the scheme will develop based on the experience we have.  The great benefit of the scheme is that it is essentially non-statutory.  If we identify difficulties in its administration or an area that has job creation potential but does not neatly fit into the terms of the scheme we will be able to review it.  Obviously the scheme will have to be in place for a reasonable period before we undertake a review but I expect that we will review it at a relatively early stage and ensure any corrections required are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I respond to Senator Bradford's comments about the Department of Justice and Equality by saying that we are a very enterprising Department.  In fairness to my colleagues across Departments not traditionally identified as having a job creation potential, we are all looking at initiatives that may be taken in our own areas to attract investors and individuals with original ideas to stimulate job creation, not only people already resident here but also people living abroad.  In that context we must do what we can to assist people already living in Ireland who have good ideas but are experiencing difficulties in getting financial backing.  That is an issue to which we will return on another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In regard to the issue raised by Senator Healy Eames, a substantial number of visas are being granted for Chinese nationals to visit Ireland.  There is no reason difficulties should be experienced regarding the conference to which she referred.  As Senator Bradford noted on her behalf, if difficulties arise my door is open and I will have them resolved.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">In regard to the visa issue generally, 91% of visa applications are accepted and a small number are not.  Some people run into difficulties with their visa applications because they do not fill out the forms correctly or provide the necessary back-up documentation.  I saw this in my constituency prior to becoming Minister, when people would tell me they had difficulties getting visas but the copies they showed me of the documentation sent into the Department clearly displayed deficiencies.  That is why they run into problems.  There is the odd occasion where the incorrect decision is made in the context of complex background circumstances and when that occurs there is always the possibility of reviewing the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The citizenship ceremonies have been an enormous success.  A number of the people accompanying those being granted citizenship, whose own experience involved attending criminal sittings of the District Court while waiting to be fitted in for a couple of minutes to swear fidelity to the State in the witness box, have asked me if they could have a second ceremony because their first ceremony was not really a ceremony at all and the experience was dreadful.  It has given a clear message that we truly value those who have chosen to come and live in this country, are contributing to their communities and are either job creators or in employment here.  We have changed the atmosphere in this area.  Many of the people I have talked to at citizenship ceremonies are innovators, employers or job creators.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">To return to something Senator Bacik said, an important element of the scheme is that an individual can come with his wife and children.  The difficulty we have is deciding to what extent one agrees to extended family members coming here.  There have been circumstances where people are lawfully here and need a grandparent to come to visit for a period or help them where a baby is born and there are other young children in the family.  At present, my Department tries to accommodate people in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I am conscious that I am running out of time.  To respond to Senator Harte, the innovative nature of this scheme is that there are a broad range of areas in which one can either invest or in respect of which, to use the terminology, one can make an endowment which is credible.  We included the sporting area and if the Senator can find someone who is willing to provide €500,000 to Finn Harps by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, I wish him well in that regard.  Provided the origins of the funding are readily identifiable and legitimate and the individual in question does not have a criminal record, we will very happily give him or her a right of residence in the State and he or she may choose to live adjacent to the Senator if he can provide the appropriate accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">If the Senator gets someone to provide €4 million or €5 million, the former England manager might take on the job for Finn Harps.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Senator Burke asked an important question.  We are still getting through the backlog of citizenship applications which built up and I believe we will have substantially dealt with it in the next two or three months.  There is an exceptional group of applications where particular security issues arise and have to be addressed because of the countries of origin of the individuals concerned.  In the context of that group, which we have been examining, it may take us until the end of the year to get through it.  I expect that anyone who makes a citizenship application by May or June and no exceptional issues of security arise because of his or her country of origin will be in the space I predicted some time ago, namely, the application will be determined within a six month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">As I have stated to Members of both Houses, if there are some people who are stuck in the system, have been here for a long time, are in important jobs and whose circumstances are being made very difficult because of the unfortunate delays that have occurred in the manner in which the scheme was previously administered, we will try to address their individual circumstances if they are brought to my attention.  We cannot do this for 6,000 or 7,000 individuals but we have done so where it has been necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">We have processed an enormous number of applications.  I became Minister on 9 March 2011 and when we reach 9 March of this year I expect that we will have processed between 23,000 and 25,000 applications in the previous 12 month period.  In 2010, just under 8,000 applications were processed.  We are coming to terms with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I express my thanks to officials in my Department who have done so much work in this area.  They have been put under much pressure by me to process applications and have done an outstanding job in officiating at and doing all the administrative work necessary on the days of each of the citizenship ceremonies that have been held.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">The arrangement in the visa system at present is that when a short-term visa is granted to enter the United Kingdom, the person may enter the Republic of Ireland and from here travel to the North of Ireland.  The ideal would be to have a reciprocal arrangement in place, that is, where a person who received a visa to enter the Republic of Ireland would be able to gain access to the United Kingdom and travel to Northern Ireland without requiring a separate visa.  We are working our way towards that.  Our systems of checking are not as sophisticated as they are in the United Kingdom and we need to bring them up to speed in certain areas to satisfy the UK authorities that there are no security issues that could arise as a result of a reciprocal arrangement.  Work is being done in that area.  I am not saying this in a party political context but there is work that should have been done in that area.  Updated technical systems should have been put in place perhaps two or three years ago but was not done.  This work has to be resourced and identifying the resources is a particular issue.  I very much hope that we will get to that place in the not too distant future.  I have spoken to the Ministers concerned and the United Kingdom does not have any difficulty in this regard, provided we have in place exactly the same protective mechanisms as it has.  I hope if I am standing here in about 12 months' time, the problem will have been resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and regret that the Minister for Justice and Equality was unable to stay.  I hope the Minister of State will highlight the issue I raise with the Minister.  I propose to share time with Senator Katherine Zappone.  I also welcome Ms Geraldine Rowley from Ruhama to the Visitors Gallery.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The Minister of State may have seen the "Prime Time" programme on prostitution which was broadcast on Tuesday last.  The investigation highlighted the appalling circumstances experienced by women who are trafficked into this country and forced into prostitution.  As Sarah Benson of Ruhama stated on the programme, prostitution is a market led trade and trafficking has become so prolific that so-called punters are able to order sex like they order takeaway food.  Men pick up the telephone night after night and ask themselves whether they will have Chinese that night or if they will try Thai or Polish.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">Pimps are making millions from this modern form of human slavery.  Estimates put the value of the Irish sex industry at €250 million per annum.  The nature of prostitution has changed dramatically, having moved from street corners, dark lanes and parked cars to anonymous apartments all over the country.  Convicted pimps are continuing to operate without any fear of getting caught because the penalties are minuscule compared to the profits.  We saw in the "Prime Time" programme Samantha Blandford who was convicted of organising prostitution some years ago and walked away with a fine of €6,500 and an 18 months suspended sentence.  She was on the programme trying to recruit one of the "Prime Time" reporters as a prostitute, without any fear of getting caught.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">The evidence from Sweden and Norway shows the best way to reduce prostitution is to criminalise supporters of sex.  There is a growing coalition outside the House, under the umbrella of the Turn Off The Red Light campaign for Irish laws to be changed in that respect.  Last October, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in response to a Private Members' debate tabled by Senator Zappone and her colleagues said the issue is being considered by the Government.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, if he can provide an update in that regard, because the law needs to be changed as a matter of urgency.  This has gone on for long enough.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KatherineZappone" eId="spk_231">
            <from>Senator Katherine Zappone</from>
            <p eId="para_497">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House and Senator Power for raising the issue as an Adjournment matter and sharing her time.  As Senator Power has identified, and as the Minister of State is aware, the Independent group tabled a motion on this issue in October 2011 to criminalise the purchase of  sex in order to curb prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, whom the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, represents, has said that offences with regard to prostitution, as they exist on the Statute Book, can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party, for example, a pimp.  It is also an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel, yet we are faced with the graphic evidence, already referred to by Senator Power, on the RTÉ documentary "Profiting from Prostitution" that these laws are clearly inadequate.  This documentary mirrors Irish research on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">In response to the matter the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said he would hold a public consultation.  I have been in touch with his office a couple of times.  On 20 December he sent me a letter to say that he hoped to announce a consultation exercise as soon as possible in January and that his office had almost completed a paper on the consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">I have three questions I hope the Minister of State can answer.  Like my colleague, Senator Power, does the Minister intend to bring forward legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex?  What we really want to know is should it be the law, following which we can then consider the legal and constitutional implications?  When will the consultation process begin on this issue?  I also recall that the Attorney General has a legal opinion on legislating for the criminalising of the purchase of sex.  Would the Minister, Deputy Shatter, consider making this information available?  As Senator Power said, the <i>status quo</i> is not working.  The policy of out of sight, out of mind — which underlines our current laws — is extremely damaging.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_501">I thank Senators Power and Zappone for raising this matter.  As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has said, he extends his apologies that he is unable to be present, therefore I speak on his behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">Before commenting on Sweden's legislative model which criminalises the purchase of sexual services I  wish to outline the legislative measures in place to tackle the phenomena of human trafficking and organised prostitution.  Ireland has strong legislation to combat the scourge of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 gave effect to Ireland's obligations in various international instruments to criminalise human trafficking.  The trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation, including prostitution, is a criminal offence and those convicted of such trafficking are liable to life imprisonment.  In addition, it is an offence under the legislation for any person to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">In the case of prostitution legislation, there are a number of offences directly aimed at protecting prostitutes from exploitation.  Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, the solicitation offence in the legislation is targeted at buyers, sellers and third parties, such as pimps.  Buyers as well as sellers are liable to prosecution and the same penalties apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The 1993 Act, as amended, provides that a person who solicits or importunes a child — whether or not for the purposes of prostitution — to commit an act which would constitute carnal knowledge or sexual assault is guilty of an offence.  Moreover, in addition to being charged with such solicitation, a person who engages in a sexual act with the child could be charged with serious offences under sexual offences legislation.  In these circumstances, consent to the sexual act is not a defence.  Strong as the law is, there is always room for improvement and the law on prostitution is being reviewed with a view to enhancing the protection of vulnerable persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">I should add that the law is being enforced.  An Garda Síochána continually targets the individuals and criminal groups involved in prostitution and related activities.  A number of individuals and criminal groups have been identified, arrested, prosecuted and convicted.  The Garda carries out targeted operations to address crime in regard to prostitution, and these often encompass situations where it is suspected that women and girls have been trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  This includes monitoring of websites associated with the advertising of prostitution, targeting the activities of criminal groups involved in organised prostitution, brothel keeping and money laundering offences.  Given the involvement of organised crime gangs, such operations may be supported by specialist assistance provided by units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">As part of the review I mentioned earlier, the Minister announced in October that he would be arranging a consultation process on the future direction of prostitution legislation.  A detailed discussion document to facilitate the consultation process is being prepared.  It will be appreciated that the discussion document, if it is to fully inform the public, needs to be prepared carefully.  It is expected that the document will be ready in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Senators have asked for clarification as to whether it is the Government's intention to change Ireland's laws on prostitution to bring them into line with the Swedish approach, as advocated by the Turn off the Red Light coalition.  The Government has not made any decision in this matter.  When the review, including public consultation, is concluded, the Minister will bring any legislative proposals to Government in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">While no decisions have been taken with regard to legislative proposals, it is important to point out, as was already indicated in the Seanad debate last October, that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sex within our legal framework raises complex issues.  A provision in the substantially different constitutional framework of one jurisdiction cannot be simply transposed into another jurisdiction's constitutional and legal framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">The Minister does not wish to appear to be dismissing the Swedish model out of hand.  All options will be considered but it is important to mention that there are issues which require in-depth examination.  The Swedish offence of purchasing sexual services would appear to be a strict liability offence.  There are difficulties in this jurisdiction in establishing offences of strict and absolute liability arising from the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  If the Swedish approach were adopted here, one party only to a two-way transaction between consenting adults would be guilty of an offence.  The buyer only would be culpable and subject to penalty, with all that entails.  The buyer would have no defence in law and the seller would not commit any offence in respect of the receipt of a consideration for sexual services.  Criminalising one party only in this manner, were it not clearly justifiable on objective grounds, could be open to constitutional challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">There would obviously be concerns too, at criminalising the sale of sex by exploited persons.  In addition to legal concerns, there are different and genuinely held views on this matter.  The Minister does not believe that the introduction of a Swedish style ban could be advanced here without a considered public debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">This is an issue which affects individuals and communities.  It is also a societal issue.  Public debate should be open to the widest possible audience and the Minister wants to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  That is the reason the Minister has decided on a consultation process before charting the way ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">I would like to thank the Senators for raising this issue today.  The Minister would like to reiterate that everything that can reasonably be done to combat prostitution will be done, and he looks forward to the outcome of the consultation process, which is expected to get under way shortly.</p>

It is important to have people informed about this issue before a major change is made.  I am not reassured by the statement in the script given to the Minister of State that the Department of Justice and Equality is of the view that our current law is strong, or that it is being enforced.  "Prime Time" clearly showed that is not the case and that is also the view of the likes of Ruhama, which is an organisation that works with women involved in prostitution.</p>

I genuinely have regard to the statements that have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">As this is a cross-bench issue and affects all of us as a society, I hope that the Senators' views would have a major influence in the process and I hope that the Department would take seriously the views that have been expressed here today.

          <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_236">
            <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
            <p eId="para_518">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House again.  I have raised on a number of occasions the issue of job creation, job losses and the responsibility of the Government and State agencies in the south east and in Waterford.  I raise this Adjournment motion on foot of a response that my party colleague, Deputy Tóibín, received from a number of State enterprise agencies about a county by county breakdown of IDA grants, the number of IDA supported companies in each county, the number of jobs that have been created and lost in each county by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and enterprise boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">The last time the Minister of State was in the House, we spoke about the Forfás plan.  The plan refers to the south east playing to its strengths.  It mentions life sciences, clean technology, internationally trading services, agrifood and so on.  I fully support that.  However, I had two problems with the plan.  First, it failed to address the core problem that the south east has the highest unemployment level in the country, 4% above the national average.  Second, it did not set any clear, realistic, deliverable targets that would reduce that figure.  Every region wants to see unemployment reduced and we want to see reductions across the board.  I know the Government is working on this area, perhaps not to my satisfaction, but it has its own plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">We are hearing from reports like this that the enterprise agencies will do all of these wonderful things for Waterford and the south east, but when we look at the hard facts and figures, that is not the case.  Let us look at the grant aid that has been made available to IDA sponsored companies in Waterford over the last number of years.  In 2006, it was €4.6 million.  In 2007, it was €7.2 million.  In 2008, it was €4.7 million.  What did Waterford get when the downturn came?  It got €854,000 in 2009 and €1.4 million in 2010.  This happened despite the fact that the average investment by the IDA from 2006 to 2008 was about €85 million.  In 2010 it was €120 million.  The amount of grant aid being made available and spent by the IDA was going up, but the amount that Waterford is getting is going down.  That has a knock-on effect across the region.  Kilkenny received nothing in 2006, €635,000 in 2007, nothing in 2008, nothing in 2009 and nothing in 2010.  Wexford received nothing in 2008, €190,000 in 2009 and €569,000 in 2010.  This has happened in spite of the fact that we have high concentrations of investment going into Cork and Dublin.  I do not wish to pitch this as a competition between any area, but I must make the point that the south east is lagging behind.  It has the highest level of unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">In two of the last three years, there was not a single visit by an IDA client company into Kilkenny.  In two of the last three years, we have seen very few such visits to Wexford.  Waterford has received a fair amount of visits, but the companies have not set up.  However, the crunch is in the job losses because all of this is about whether the plans are working and whether we are creating jobs.  In 2007, there were 6,300 sponsored jobs in Waterford.   That dropped to 6,000 in 2008, to 5,600 in 2009, 5,300 in 2010 and 4,600 in 2011.  We see the pattern of jobs being lost every year and not being replaced.  It is great to have a report and say all of this stuff is happening, but the Forfás report does not put in place any realistic, deliverable, credible proposals that will deal with the facts that I have presented here today, which show that Waterford and the south-east region are lagging behind in job creation.  The enterprise agencies are frankly not doing enough.</p>

            <from>Senator Jim Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_522">I endorse everything that Senator Cullinane has said.  The south east lags behind in a range of areas, including medical provisions.  The unemployment situation is dire.  Waterford is the capital of the region and we have seen significant unemployment rise there in recent years, with very badly targeted approaches to resolve it.  Wexford continues to be a real unemployment black spot.  It ranks consistently third or fourth highest in the unemployment league.  There needs to be a really focused effort, rather than just something that allows the Minister of State to answer on an Adjournment debate but does nothing for the people on the ground who are starved of employment and who are seeking to get it.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">Wexford has suffered significantly because of the fall in the construction industry.  Much of our employment was based on that sector and the collapse of that sector has given rise to 18% unemployment, and it is not a whole lot better across the region.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_238" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_524">I am glad that both Senators have raised the issue.  The last point made was about the over-dependence on the construction industry.  That is part of the structural difficulty which exists in many of the regions outside of the larger urban conurbations, where the labour force moved into the construction industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">When the construction industry fell apart, all of a sudden there were massive rates of unemployment.  The south east, in particular, has seen its unemployment rate jump from 4.9% in 2007 — which was marginally above the countrywide average of 4.6% — to 18.2%, compared with a national average of 14.3%.  There is a clear acknowledgement of the difficulties facing the south east.  I will be frank and say that neither of the two Senators have proffered any solutions.  We must acknowledge that State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as local authorities, academic institutions and enterprise boards, will have to be part of a plan to stem that tide of unemployment and reverse the trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_526">The south-east action plan contains specific actions to address the unemployment problems affecting the south east.  The plan, which is geographically oriented towards that area, was launched more than two months ago, on 2 December.  Its intention is to provide for regular meetings with a forum representing the agencies and local stakeholders to progress its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">The structural challenges faced by the south east region have built up over many years and will not be reversed by a simple set of actions.  What is required is to build a stronger local enterprise base in the region as a whole.  The report identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition, but it will only achieve so much.  The Senators will acknowledge that we cannot reverse the unemployment trend overnight.  There will need to be structural changes and investments in key areas in order to stem that tide.  There are challenges for all agencies to build up the region's competitive advantage and then promote it in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">One of the key issues that no single agency or Department can hope to address is the issue of the overall coherence of the region's value proposition to investors from home or abroad.  What has arisen again and again in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and agencies in the region is the need for greater co-ordination of effort from all those with an interest in improving the enterprise potential of the region.  This was brought to the fore when the agencies, local authorities, CEBs, educational institutions and other local representative groups met with the Minister on 24 November last.  That meeting was the first time a group of that nature had met with a focus solely on what could be done to improve the region's fortunes, which is worth noting.  We must also bear in mind that the figures quoted by Senator Cullinane are from a time when a different political entity was at the helm.  In all fairness, what this Government has done is to seek to meet the challenges faced by the south east head-on, in partnership with the State agencies.  I understand the Senator will want to score a point off me, as Minister of State, but he should recognise that people across party political boundaries want to work together to stem the tide of unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">The Minister intends in the coming year to facilitate a series of further meetings of that same group as a means of monitoring the implementation of the proposals in this report and also to forge greater co-operation and collaboration between the various stakeholders across the region.  I hope Senator Cullinane will get on board with that process.</p>

            <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
            <p eId="para_531">I regret the fact that the Minister of State's contribution was defensive.  What I was putting on the record were facts, and at no point did I say the Minister of State who is in the Chamber was responsible for any of what has happened in the south east.  I was simply saying there was a problem and that it needs to be solved.  There is also room for constructive criticism of the Government, because it is this Government — in the form of the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation — that published the Forfás plan.  A previous Minister who sat in that chair acknowledged there was a lack of deliverable targeted responses and that the plan was long on high aspirations and short on specifics.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">The Minister of State asked about solutions.  The solutions are obvious and staring us in the face when we look at the figures I gave.  The solution is balanced regional development.  The plan, for example, talks about the region playing to its strengths in life sciences, internationally-traded services and other areas on which we can concentrate.  The enterprise agencies should give us the support we need to achieve this.  We have seen that from 2009 onwards, companies in Waterford and the south east have received less grant aid at a time when more money is being spent, and that the area has the highest unemployment levels in the country.  We must point out these failures.  These may not be the fault of the Minister of State sitting in the chair, but they represent a failure of his Government, previous Governments and the State agencies to bring about balanced regional development.  Whatever solutions, positive as they are, are established by this Government, I will fully support them, because we all want to see jobs for people in this country, but where there are shortcomings, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that we have a responsibility to point them out.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_533">It is not just a matter of identifying a set of metrics from 2007 to 2010.  We need to consider the problem from a qualitative point of view.  We cannot just extrapolate from the rate of investment by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland and say that in monetary terms, the south east has not benefited, because other regions have the same claim, in real terms.  We can say that the larger urban areas such as Cork, Dublin and Galway have a disproportionately high rate of inward investment in the form of IDA projects, but we also need to consider human capital, soft skills and the relationships among stakeholders.  There is now a model, sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to deal with this.  It is not that I am being defensive.  If we are debating an issue, we need to set out the parameters for that debate.  We must have due regard to the fact that all of the stakeholders want to drive this on.  In fairness to all political entities, they also want to drive this on.  If it needs to be critiqued, we are open to that.  However, it is not just a question of investment by the IDA, although that is one aspect of it.  It is a question, also, of ensuring that we can deliver on education.  Senator Cullinane will be aware of my commitment to the Telecommunications Software &amp; Systems Group, TSSG, which is, as far as I am concerned, a beacon for the region.  We need to mine more of that intellectual development and human capital.  Inch by inch, that is what will restore the region so that we have a level playing field.  I have listened to the points that were made.  We are not going to be complacent about this.  We have a job to do.</p>

            <from>Senator Jim Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_537">Following on from the previous discussion, the key to solving the problem of unemployment is undoubtedly education.  However, there is a need to accelerate this, because there is a generation of people who cannot wait around.  Their contributions, their talents and their lives will be lost as a consequence of not being able to obtain employment.  That motivated me to table this matter on the Adjournment, which relates to our third level institutions.  We have had great success in this regard in the past 12 to 15 years, with a 60% increase in the number of students accessing our tertiary education system.  That is to be welcomed; in fact, we have achieved one of the highest third level participation rates in Europe, which should be to the country's benefit in the future.  However, it will only be to our benefit if the quality of the education is commensurate with the requirements of the economy and is of a standard that is favourable compared to other international educational institutions.  Therefore, the decline in the performance of our universities, as discussed recently in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> and also in comments by the new president of the American Chamber of Commerce, is of concern.  In September last year the new <i>Irish Times</i> education editor said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_538">The new international league table is a serious blow to the Irish university sector. Two years ago TCD was in the elite top 50 colleges, while UCD was in the top 100.  Over the past two years both of Ireland's leading colleges have lost significant ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">During the course of the past month the newly appointed President of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, Mr. Peter O'Neill, also the managing director of IBM, made some arresting comments, of which we should all take note, about which we should be concerned and which we should seek to address in a way that avoids the impact he has foreseen.  He spoke of concerns in respect of six of the seven Irish universities falling out of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.  He said that some Irish universities and colleges may need to merge to supply better educated graduates to industry and he expressed concern about the fact that Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin had dropped out of the top 100, although I am unsure whether that is correct.  He mentioned UCC, NUI Galway, Dublin City University and DIT.  Some of these have dropped from the top 400 and some from the top 300.  The alarming comment was that "Already, some of our member firms in the key Digital, ICT, life sciences, and financial services areas are reporting difficulties in hiring suitable candidates."  He went on to say that "55% of the demand for ICT professionals in Ireland is being met by inward migration" at a time when our native population is crying out for jobs but obviously lacking the necessary skills and qualifications.  He pointed out that these companies are highly mobile and had been attracted by good policies in the past which focused on the talent available.  He noted that there had been a pro-business environment from Government at the time and suggested our position as the only English-speaking member of the eurozone was an advantage.  These were among many of the reasons they came here.  He went on say that if they could not find suitable talent here, Ireland would not be considered for future investments and, worse, that the existing operations may choose to move on to a competitor country where they could find qualified staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">We have been warned that US companies may well bypass Ireland in future.  This prompted me to put down this motion on the Adjournment to call on the Minister to make a statement on the specific intentions and measures he has in mind to address the concerns expressed by the President of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and which, I imagine, are shared by the Minister and by everyone in these Houses.  There is urgency about this matter given what has been said.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_247" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_541">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is recognised that international ranking systems are referenced by international investors, employers and students and consequently they cannot be ignored.  However, it should also be noted that these systems are not infallible and it is widely agreed that they should be interpreted with caution.  We can draw encouragement from the overall performance of the Irish system on the latest Times Higher Education system performance tables which place Ireland firmly in the world's top 20.  We are ranked 17th overall and sixth in the world relative to our GDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">The focus in Ireland is on sustaining and advancing performance throughout the system as a whole rather than investing in elite institutions.  Earlier last year the Minister, Deputy Quinn, set out his priorities for the development of the higher education system during the next 20 years and endorsed a range of actions to develop the quality of teaching and learning and to ensure the relevance of programme and curriculum design throughout the system.  These actions are focused on improving the overall student experience and improving the quality and employability of Irish graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">On 30 January the President of American Chamber of Commerce Ireland joined the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Chairs of the Higher Education Authority, the expert group on future skills needs and ICT Ireland to launch a new action plan to address the high-level ICT skills needs of enterprise in Ireland.  The action plan is available on the Department website.  It was developed in response to a clear message from industry that there are ICT skills shortages and, more important, that jobs can be created if we have the graduates to fill them.  In a highly mobile and global sector such as ICT, inward migration by skilled professionals will always play a key role in meeting the skills needs of companies.  However, boosting the domestic supply of graduates for 21st century jobs is a key objective for the education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">The action plan, published last week, has been developed during the past 12 months with close collaboration between officials of the Department of Education and Skills, the expert group on future skills needs, the HEA, ICT Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  It sets out short-, medium- and long-term actions with specific time-bound targets to meet the skills gap in the short term while, in tandem, building up the longer term supply of high quality graduates.  This includes the establishment of an ambitious target of doubling the annual output of ICT graduates from 1,000 this year to 2,000 by 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">The skills shortages experienced have not arisen overnight and are not unique to Ireland.  There are no quick-fix solutions that will meet all of the shortages overnight.  However, the plan includes steps that will be taken to increase the supply of graduates within the next 12 months.  The key action in this regard is the immediate roll-out of 750 places on 17 new fully funded graduate skills conversion programmes throughout the country.  These programmes have been developed by public and private higher education providers in collaboration with industry partners.  Participants on the programmes will obtain a post graduate qualification in core computing skills at honours degree level and will be offered a work placement with one of the companies involved in the design of the programmes.  Details of all of the new conversion programmes are available on the <i>BlueBrick.ie</i> web portal.  The majority of the programmes will be under way by March and applications can be submitted immediately through the website.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">I welcome much of what the Minister of State has said.  I realise the rankings are based on four pillars of research, including teaching, employability and internationalisation.  Clearly, an element of subjectivity is involved.  The first paragraph and other parts of the Minister's response could be interpreted as having a level of complacency.  We whistle past the graveyard at our peril.  Several issues were not touched on in the Minister of State's reply and I draw his attention to them.  The issue of financial resources was touched on but what about the quality of management of our universities, the application of the professors and lecturers and the number of lecturing hours they deliver?  There should be a greater emphasis on innovation in our colleges.  The structures of the colleges, how they are managed, their quality, and how they are administered represent a large part of what we must address and attend to in order to extract best possible results from the scare resources we have to invest.</p>

            <p eId="para_547">I appreciate the points made by Senator Walsh but I do not believe there is a sense of complacency.  The opposite is the case; there is a great sense of urgency and there are sleepless nights in respect of how we should address this problem.  The bottom line is that one can extrapolate from the Times Higher Education system performance tables.  One can delve into the criteria they apply.  Criteria for measuring rankings differ from one set of rankings to another.  There is no sense of complacency.  The data are important and widely reported and when the reports come in we take them seriously.  In fairness our work and that of previous Governments with American Chamber of Commerce Ireland stands up.  When they send signals across the table we sit up and listen, as have previous Governments; if messages come from them we take note.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">It is important to realise that there are many Irish people working in US companies who have had long and distinguished careers in those companies.  They are very attuned to their needs as well and they have the ear of Government.  In fairness, traditionally Fianna Fáil Governments have set out this approach and have been a part of the process for the science, technology and innovation programmes.  This is an apolitical area.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">With regard to the points made by Senator Walsh, there is a strong sense of the urgency in respect of dealing with the skills shortages.  However, the Senator will acknowledge that there was an over-reliance on construction and many children went into construction studies from second level rather than software engineering or other engineering programmes and one cannot turn around that ship overnight.  It is healthy for the system to have world class researchers coming from abroad.  It causes us to up our game.  I appreciate the points made.  There is no sense of complacency; we are moving rapidly to address the deficit.</p>

            <p eId="para_550">Ta céad fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit arís. Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch de faoi theacht isteach le freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist atá ardaithe agam anocht.  Baineann an cheist leis an maoiniú a bhí ar fáil dos na hábhair oidí atá ins na coláistí oiliúna agus a bheidh ag múineadh inár gcuid bunscoileanna amach anseo.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">Mar chuid de gach cúrsa bunmhúinteoireachta — agus brisfidh mé isteach i mBéarla i gceann nóiméid chomh maith — caithfidh na daoine atá ag freastal ar an gcúrsa tréimhse trí seachtainí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus le heolas a chur ar shaol agus ar chultúr na Gaeltachta.  Tá an maoiniú le haghaidh sin gearrtha dos na coláistí ag an Aire.  Tá mé ag iarraidh fáil amach an bhfuil sé fós mar bhunriachtanas don chéim go gcaithfeadh na mic léinn an chuid seo den chúrsa a dhéanamh.  Ma tá, cé tá chun íoc as?</p>
            <p eId="para_552">I am raising the issue of primary school teachers who, when doing their training courses, have to spend three weeks in the Gaeltacht to improve their Irish and become knowledgeable about its culture and lifestyle.  The Minister recently announced there has been a cut in the budget to allow them to do that.  I am seeking clarification from him on this issue because it is still a prerequisite for teaching degrees that students have to do this part of the course.  Who is going to pay for that?  If students have to pay for it, it is estimated it will cost €750 per student, which is an extra cost to student teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">I echo some of the Minister's words.  He mentioned that we need to look at things from a qualitative point of view, and not just at the metrics.  This is an issue where we need to do that.  There is a 20 year strategy for the Irish language which all parties in these Houses accepted and are fully supportive of.  It was developed under the previous Government.  It has been taken on board by the new Government and we have been told over and over again that the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is fully supportive of and intends to implement the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">This decision completely contravenes the ethos and word of the strategy and flies completely in its face.  The 20 year strategy for the Irish language recommends that student teachers should follow a defined programme of language teaching in the Gaeltacht and that the tuition time and attendance of student teachers who attend such courses should be increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">It also flies in the face of best practice, as outlined by the Teaching Council, in its new guidelines published for the teacher training colleges.  One of its recommendations is that programmes should provide for an extended and re-conceptualised Gaeltacht residency which will now form part of the overall programme and be under the direct jurisdiction of the teacher education providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">The strategy the Government told us it is fully supportive of and the Teaching Council recommends is that not only should these courses be kept but that they should be increased and improved.  The funding has been pulled.  I appreciate we are in straitened economic times but this is a very shortsighted cutback.  People like Éamonn Mac Niallais, spokesperson for Guth na Gaeltachta, have said that the long-term effects of this shortsighted decision will cost the State even more money to put right when future teachers no longer have the standard of Irish to teach the language in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">There is grave concern out there.  The comprehensive study of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, which was done in 2007 under the auspices of NUIG, indicated the language would die if we did not address at as a matter of urgency within 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">One of the major issues was education.  A sub-committee is implementing the 20 year strategy.  It comprises members from the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  They are supposed to be looking at these issues.  Did they discuss this issue before the cutback was made?  This is a metric which does not consider the qualitative nature of the course, even taking on board the principles and policy of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">This is also very important from a Gaeltacht perspective.  It is an important industry which provides income for na mná tí who keep students and run the courses at a very economical rate.  I ask the Minister of State to reply and reconsider the decision, and convey our concerns to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">Iarraim ar an Seanadóir mo leithscéal a ghabháil toisc nach bhfuil Gaeilge líofa agam.  B'fhearr liom leanúint i mBéarla, lena thoil.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">This House is aware that, in the context of budget 2012 and the need for the State to achieve economic independence in the coming years, difficult choices had to be made to achieve savings.  To this end, in 2011 all Departments carried out a comprehensive review of expenditure on all budgets and programmes, and proposals to achieve savings were put to Government.  As one of the largest spending Departments, this was also the case in regard to expenditure on education.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">In making these difficult decisions, priority was given to protecting resources for front line services as far as possible in the coming years.  For example, the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level has been maintained and the overall number of special needs assistants and resource teachers will be maintained at current levels.  However, savings had to be made, even against a background of the expected increase in the school going population in the coming years.  One such decision was the abolition, for new students, of the grant paid for student teachers' three week placement in Gaeltacht summer colleges.  Currently, satisfactory attendance at an Irish language course in the Gaeltacht is a compulsory element of the primary initial teacher education, ITE, courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">In respect of students in the State-funded colleges of education, the Department pays a grant of €637 per student directly to the Gaeltacht summer colleges per three week course.  This is an annual cost of over €700,000, representing moneys that would have to be found elsewhere within the education budget.  The removal of the grant means students will be liable for the cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">We would all prefer if this choice did not have to be made.  It has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible.  This move brings the primary ITE courses more into line with a number of other types of degree programmes, such as language degrees, where students are required to bear the costs of additional special requirements themselves.  For example, there are modern languages degrees where a stay in a foreign country might be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">The Senator might wish to note ITE courses are being reconfigured in line with the recommendations of the Department's literacy and numeracy strategy and the Teaching Council's policy on teacher education, and the need to ensure that all primary teachers are competent and confident in their use of the Irish language, especially given its importance in the primary school curriculum.  To this end, we are looking at raising the bar in regard to the Irish leaving certificate entry requirement for teacher education, but the quality of engagement during the Gaeltacht placement also needs to be of a high standard and be more focused on the outcomes required for our teachers.</p>

            <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_566">I take it from the answer the requirement to do the three week placement will remain in place and students will have to cover the costs.  There needs to be some form of recognition that there are many students from lower socioeconomic groups who will not be in a position to pay for courses, which would exclude them from the possibility of being able to complete their courses.  The Minister should reconsider putting the funding back in place.  In the overall context of the Department, this does not involve massive funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">If that is not possible, there should be some form of funding available for people who cannot afford it, are in a position of hardship or come from very low income backgrounds.  Such people should be helped in terms of funding for these courses in order that there is a fair playing field for all people across the spectrum from all parts of society.  We should not create an elitist situation where if one has the money, one can get a teaching degree but if one does not one cannot.  I fear that could happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">The Senator's point is fair.  I wish I was in a position to be able to tell him we can  reverse this decision but we cannot.  Some 80% of the budget relates to pay.  There are commitments under Croke Park.  I have to be honest and straight with the Senator.  The decision has been made with regard to this budget line.  However, the IT courses will be reconfigured in line with the recommendations.  It is the case that the money is not there.  I do not want to plámás the Senator or give him the usual political platitudes but I must be straight with him and tell him that the money is not there.</p>
